<hr>
<p>CHAPTER 1 <br> <i>A MELANCHOLY RETURN</i></p>-->
<p>“Who dares kill Kildare, Kildare kills!”</p>

<p>These words, many times repeated, sometimes in tones of fierce anger, sometimes in accents of profound melancholy, were spoken by the younger of two wayworn travellers, whose weary horses were patiently and laboriously picking their way through the dark forest tracks, as the long midsummer day drew to its close, and the twilight stole upon them almost unawares.</p>

<p>“Who dares kill Kildare, Kildare kills!”</p>

<p>The elder of the two riders, who was somewhat in advance of his companion, turned in his saddle, and spoke sharply,—</p>

<p>“Tush, boy! A truce to idle threats! If you save your own skin by getting safe out of this accursed country, you may thank your good star for the boon. As for any thought of vengeance—poof! It is worse than folly to dream of it.”</p>

<p>The face of the young brother of Lord Kildare darkened at the sound of these words, but he made no reply; only his lips moved, and then set themselves in lines of resolute defiance.</p>

<p>“It has been a mistake from beginning to end,” pursued Lord Hascombe, speaking as much to himself as to his companion. “I have known that ever since we landed in England, and found only a handful of men ready to join our standard. James, we need not blind our eyes any longer. That youth was no more the Earl of Warwick than you or I. He was an impostor, palmed off upon us. He was a puppet set in the place of a living man, of whose person Lord Lovel hoped to get speedy possession, either by force or strategy, and to substitute for the puppet. We have been deceived from first to last, and Heaven alone knows what will be the forfeit some of us will be called upon to pay!”</p>

<p>“Duchess Margaret of Burgundy thought differently,” answered young Fitzgerald, with a touch of sullenness in his manner. “Would she have sent two thousand men to fight for an impostor?” </p>

<p>“Cleverer women than the Duchess Margaret have been deceived before now,” answered Lord Hascombe. “The boy was personable, and well drilled in his part. But Henry Tudor, who sits upon the throne of England—a curse upon all usurpers!—is a cleverer man than the late King Richard. <i>He</i> would have killed the boy ere this; and then a clever tale of imposture might find credence, and spread and increase. But when the real earl can be taken abroad and shown in London town to those who have known him from boyhood, what chance is there for the impostor?”</p>

<p>“You believe that story, then?”</p>

<p>“Ay, James, I do; and you had best believe it also, and make the best of what is a bad enough tangle.”</p>

<p>“Bad enough, when two Fitzgeralds lie dead upon the field of Stoke!” cried the youth, breaking out suddenly into one of his gusts of passionate anger. “May I only live to avenge their death upon Henry of Richmond! I will never call him king! He is a murderer of lawful kings, and of those whose rights are better than his own. He is the murderer of Kildare’s brothers. Let him beware of the family motto, ‘Who dares kill Kildare, Kildare kills.’”</p>

<p>Lord Hascombe slightly shrugged his shoulders. He knew well the fiery temper of the Fitzgeralds. His beautiful young wife was a sister of the Earl of Kildare, and he had often been a guest at the ancestral home of her family. Indeed, it was upon a recent visit to Ireland that he had become embroiled in the present revolt, which has gone down to history under the name of the revolt of Lambert Simnel, and which ended so disastrously and speedily for those concerned in it, on the field of Stoke.</p>

<p>Lord Hascombe was in some considerable perturbation of mind, and that not without cause. He came from a family of ardent Yorkists, and although without any strong personal attachment to the late King Richard, who had paid the penalty of many crimes upon the field of Bosworth, fidelity to the cause to which he was attached by strong hereditary bonds had led him to embrace the cause of Richard when Henry asserted his claim, and to light for him at that battle; and he had distinguished himself on that occasion by many feats of signal daring, so that Henry Tudor had taken note of him, and asked his name and rank.</p>

<p>No hurt had come to him for that act of opposition to the man who now reigned as England’s king. Henry had been wise in his policy of conciliation, and had posed as the man who united in his own person, as well as by his subsequent marriage with Elizabeth of York, the rival claims of the houses of York and Lancaster.</p>

<p>If this claim could not be pushed too far, or too closely scrutinized, at least it suited the needs of the hour, and the people as a whole were ready to receive it without overmuch criticism. The power of the great nobles had been broken by the conflicting fortunes of the War of the Roses. The country was crying aloud for peace. Henry, from motives of policy as much as from any other cause, was willing enough to adopt a course of leniency and reasonable moderation. Very few suffered death or attainder at his accession—only those few whose property was required to swell the kingly wealth and power of the new monarch. The rest were pardoned and suffered to go their way; and Lord Hascombe had brought his fair young wife to Hascombe Hall, in the hope of living there in peace and quietness for the remainder of his life.</p>

<p>But his evil star seemed in the ascendant. Some business connected with the lady’s dowry had obliged him, though most reluctantly, to leave her some few months since. He had hoped to be absent only a few weeks, but had been detained by unforeseen difficulties; and, worst of all, he had been drawn into this rash revolt against the newly-made king, and had been persuaded to fight in person in the cause of one whom he now firmly believed to be nothing but a vulgar impostor.</p>

<p>And how would the king regard this second offence? Lord Hascombe was possessed of one of those highly-strung natures at once rash and timid. In the hour of peril, when he was worked up by stress of excitement, he would throw prudence to the winds, and embark upon any cause that seemed to him just and right, and which commanded his sympathies at the moment. He was full of chivalrous daring, and eager to espouse the side of the weak and oppressed; but when the hour of stress was past, and reason had had time to assert her calmer sway, he would become cautious to the verge of timidity; and though never afraid to meet death upon the field of battle, he was in terrible fear of the disgrace which might meet him within the walls of his own house.</p>

<p>It was this fear of consequences which was now pursu- ing him, and dogging his steps like a grisly phantom.</p>

<p>Every man is disposed somewhat to over-estimate his own individual importance. Lord Hascombe was not one of the great nobles of the kingdom, but he did not feel that he was obscure enough for his recent act of rebellion to be passed unnoticed by the king and his council. There was no reckoning upon the policy which would be pursued with regard to this outbreak. It was one thing for the newly-made monarch to condone the offence of those who had resisted him at the outset—policy and justice alike dictated such moderation; but how would it be when these same men mixed themselves up with rebellions and seditions which had for their object the dethronement of the king and the setting up of a rival in his place? Might not Henry feel that the best way of putting a stop to all such movements for the future would be the taking of an exemplary vengeance upon such as had been known to be concerned in this abortive attempt? It was known that the king had a great idea of the power of his prerogative, and that he intended to be ruler in his kingdom in no ambiguous fashion.</p>

<p>Lord Hascombe was turning over all manner of uneasy thoughts in his mind as he rode homeward in the gathering dusk, with his wife’s brother for his companion. What would be the best course for him to pursue in the future? Should he appear at Westminster and ask pardon of the king for his act of folly? Or should he carry off his wife, and escape to Ireland with young Fitzgerald, and wait there till the storm had blown over, hoping that per- haps if his flight were speedy and secret, the very fact of his return might remain a secret, and the world believe that it was a mistake which reported him to have been present at the battle of Stoke?</p>

<p>The more he thought of this plan the more feasible did it appear to him. His wife would be delighted to return to Ireland. She had not rooted herself in any way in her new home. It was absolutely necessary that Fitzgerald should get safe out of the country as fast as possible, and why should they not all fly together? Then they would see what line the king took, and how far he inflicted chastisement upon those who had joined the standard of revolt. They would at least be safe from personal peril; and if the offence were condoned or passed over, they could safely return home when the excitement had somewhat subsided</p>.

<p>There was one element of difficulty in this scheme, and that was the little baby boy who had been born during Lord Hascombe’s absence from home. The child was but a month old, and had been delicate and frail. Would it be possible for a tender infant to undergo the fatigues of a hasty journey? And if not, would the mother consent to be parted from her child for a while? It was no uncommon thing for ladies of rank to put out their children with foster-mothers for a time, and perhaps this had already been done with the heir of the house of Hascombe. But that was a different matter from leaving him altogether; and young mothers were so different in the way in which they regarded their children. Some took but little notice of them, treating the baby rather in the light of an animated toy, to be played with at intervals; whilst others would scarcely be parted from it night or day, and regarded with jealousy any person seeking to gain any hold upon its infant affections.</p>

<p>It was the thought of wife and child at home that was spurring on the weary traveller to take this last long stage of a toilsome journey. But for that, the travellers would have paused ere this and sought the hospitality of some wayside inn, for they and their horses were alike jaded and exhausted.</p>

<p>But the country had become familiar to Lord Hascombe; now every tree and stone was known to him. They had out-ridden their two attendants in their haste to be once more within the walls of a home.</p>

<p>Although Lord James Fitzgerald had never yet been to Hascombe Hall, the thought of the welcome he would receive from his sister, and the sympathy she would give him in his sorrow and his rage, spurred him as strongly as did yearning love his elder companion.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven we are at our journey’s end!” cried Lord Hascombe at last, drawing rein before a pair of great gates, which he dismounted to unfasten and swing open. Even the exhausted horses seemed to realize now that they were within measurable distance of the sorely-needed rest and food, and finding a pleasant grass road beneath their feet, they started into a hand-gallop of their own accord. Soon the riders had entered a fine quadrangular courtyard, and serving-men were coming hastily out, in great astonishment at seeing their master arrive so unexpectedly, and in such sorry plight.</p>

<p>“There is trouble abroad, good Parr,” said Lord Hascombe to his head groom. “I and your lady may have to start forth again in a very short space. Let it not be known that I have returned. Keep the secret for the present in the household. Times are full of peril and difficulty. My head may not be safe, a week from this. We live in troublous days—troublous days. But give me news of your lady, and the boy. I have heard naught but the fact of his birth.”</p>

<p>“My lady is well, and as bright as a bird,” answered the faithful servant, as his master slowly dismounted with the air of a sorely weary man; “and the little lad is doing bravely now, though he was but a small morsel at the first. Good Mary Beetel of the mill has him. She was with my lady here for three weeks, but had then to return home, and took the little master with her. My lady goes twice a day to the mill to see him, and they all say he is thriving there better than he did at home.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Lord Hascombe, with a sense of sudden relief. “No better home could he have than that with the honest Beetels.”</p>

<p>But he could ask no more, even had not his own impatience to see his wife driven him towards the house, for already the rumour of the master’s return without warning had spread through the place, and at that moment a door from the courtyard into the main building was thrown wide open, and, in the glow of yellow light that streamed forth, there appeared a slight, girlish figure with shining hair, and arms outstretched in welcome.</p>

<p>“My life, dearest life!—my own beloved lord and master!” </p>

<p>“Geraldine!—sweetheart!—wife!”</p>

<p>He clasped her in his arms; he almost carried her up the flight of wide steps down which she had flown to meet and greet him. Together they passed into the great baronial hall, dark with its sombre panelling, grim with its trophies of arms, and great antlered heads of majestic deer, or the tusked, fierce face of some wild boar of the woods.</p>

<p>Upon the raised daïs at the end a small table had been set, and servants were hurrying to and fro, bringing forth good cheer for the welcome of the travellers; but hunger and weariness were alike forgotten by the husband, as he drew his fair young wife to his side, seeking the shelter of a deep embrasure where the shadows fell dimly, and where they were half concealed from the eyes of the hurrying servants by the fall of a tapestry curtain.</p>

<p>“My life, my dearest life, how good it is to see thee! Ah, what terrible days of anxious sorrow I have known!”</p>

<p>“Thou hast been anxious for me, sweetheart? But wherefore? What didst thou know?”</p>

<p>“Know? Why, that men were whispering of rebellion; were telling of what Kildare was doing, and of the German and Irish soldiers that would land upon these shores and proclaim another king. Did I not know that thou wast with Kildare, and that thy heart was as his heart, and had never inclined well towards Henry Tudor? What could I not fear? What should I not fear? And every day as it passed by, and fresh rumours swept through the land—ah, what have I not suffered! But thou art safe, thou art well, thou art home again in mine arms. Now I fear no longer.”</p>

<p>He held her to his breast, and covered her face with kisses. In that first moment of meeting he would not speak of the peril in which he stood. Let them be happy together for one short hour. But as she raised her face from his shoulder, to gaze into his eyes, and make sure that it was her own dear lord again, and no dream or vision, her glance swept across the hall to where a second figure sat outstretched in a great oaken chair, weary, dejected, heart-sick, despairing; and when she saw it she sprang to her feet with a little cry.</p>

<p>“James! James! It is my brother!—Paul, why did you not tell me? Ah, there is something the matter.—James, speak! What is it?”</p>

<p>Young Fitzgerald was almost past speech. He had received several slight wounds during the desperate fighting at Stoke, the marvel being that he had escaped the fate of his elder brothers. But the long ride, and the sense of crushing defeat and peril to come, had taxed his strength to the uttermost, and he scarce heard the frightened exclamations of his sister as she hung over him, calling to husband and servants to bring wine, medicaments, cordials—fear and misgiving taking the place of the first joy which had filled her heart upon seeing her husband again.</p>

<p>“He has been wounded; he has been fighting!” she cried, with white lips.—”And thou, Paul—wert thou there also? Tell me—has there been a battle?”</p>

<p>“Ay, and a day of disaster for the cause Kildare embraced—he and all his house. Thou wouldst not have had thy husband hold back when thine own kinsfolk were in the field?”</p>

<p>Her face had turned very white, but her eyes were clear and full of fire.</p>

<p>“Nay, never, never; but it is all so strange and terrible. Hast thou indeed borne arms again against the king?”</p>

<p>“I have—” He stopped suddenly, as though he would have spoken more, yet knew not what to say; and at that moment young Fitzgerald’s eyes opened, and he spoke,— </p>

<p>“Who dares kill Kildare, Kildare kills!”</p>

<p>The old family legend was familiar enough to the ears of Lady Hascombe; she glanced at her brother and then at her husband.</p>

<p>“He has a touch of fever. He keeps saying that over and over again. If we could get him to bed, and he could sleep, that would be the best thing for him. He will want all his strength for what lies before us on the morrow.”</p>

<p>“Sleep!” cried young Fitzgerald, in the same low, whispering tones. “Ay, there be those whose sleep is sound! Thomas—Maurice—who will wake them, save the last trump of doom? But they shall be avenged—ay, verily they shall be avenged! Does not the blood of the Kildares run in their veins?’ Who dares kill Kildare—’”</p>

<p>Geraldine’s horror-stricken face was turned upon her husband; every drop of blood had ebbed from her cheeks.</p>

<p>“What does he mean? Oh, what does he mean? Thomas!—Maurice! Husband, husband, tell me the truth.”</p>

<p>“The truth is a sad one, my life. Your two brothers were too truly slain at that grim battle from which we have just come. How young James escaped I know not, for he fought with the fury of his name and race. It was less a battle at the last than a slaughter. The German troops stood at bay, with the wild Irish kerns beside them, and were hacked to pieces by Henry’s men. ‘Twas a sight I can never forget. Scarce thought I to leave that bloody field alive myself—”</p>

<p>But at these words his wife suddenly flung herself into his arms, weeping with the abandonment of her excitable Irish nature.</p>

<p>“Tell me no more! Tell me no more! I cannot bear it! Ah, was not my heart a true prophet when it beat so heavily these many days? Thomas! Brave young Maurice! Alas, alas! a curse upon the fatal day! And a life yet more precious to me in such deadly peril!”</p>

<p>She clung to him, sobbing, exclaiming, weeping out wild words of sorrow and menace. The blood of the Fitzgeralds was in her veins, together with the wild traditions of a wild race. Anger and grief battled together in the slight, girlish frame that shook with the tempest of her passion; and her husband had tnuch ado to still the storm, though he set himself tenderly to the task; whilst the servants bore James Fitzgerald to a sleeping chamber above, and gave him soothing draughts and such nourishment as he could swallow, and the sleeping potion which quickly had the desired effect, and which might do more for him than food and medicine put together.</p>

<p>Husband and wife sat down at length together at the table in the great hall. Geraldine’s tears were dried, and the first tempest of her grief had subsided. She was all eagerness now to see her lord refresh himself after his long and toilsome ride; his jaded looks went to her heart, and she repressed her own grief and anxious questionings to minister to his pressing needs. Both felt that much had yet to be spoken that night; but for the moment they, as by mutual agreement, let anxious themes go by, and wellnigh, in their joy at being once again united, forgot the sorrows by which they were surrounded.</p>

<p>“And thou hast not told me yet of the boy,” said Lord Hascombe, drawing his wife close to him with his arm. “I can scarce believe yet that I am a father and thou art a mother. Thou art hardly more than a child thyself.”</p>

<p>Geraldine gave her head a bewitching little toss, and there was a touch of maternal pride in her face and voice as she made answer,—</p>

<p>“Ah, it is a pity he is not here. It is but a week since Mary carried him home with her. She said the air was not so good—that we were too much shut in here by trees— that he would thrive better with her. He is such a little morsel, but pretty. Ah, thou shalt see him for thyself. He has such dainty little hands and feet, and the hair on his little head lies already in golden rings. Mary says it may perchance come off, but I will not believe it.”</p>

<p>“And is he strong and healthy?”</p>

<p>“Not sickly, but not so robust as Mary’s boy, who is some few days older. He is such a rogue, and Mary is so proud of him! I trow thou wilt think little Edgar the prettier; but baby Edmund is a fine little fellow. And I scarce know which Mary loves the better.”</p>

<p>“You had the little one christened?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes—he seemed so frail and sickly. The priest came at once. I bade them call him Edgar, for thou hadst said thou didst wish that name if it were a boy. They took him to Mary, and when she was able she came here with both the boys, and would have stayed, but she was so sure the mill suited them better, and I thought she knew better than I”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; I am glad that he should be there in such kind keeping. And thou, sweet wife—would it go very hard with thee to part for a while from thy boy?”</p>

<p>She looked at him with wide, frightened eyes</p>.

<p>“Part from him? What dost thou mean, Paul?”</p>

<p>“I mean, sweetheart, that I fear for the king’s displeasure. Twice have I been found with arms in my hand against him. Thou art the sister of Lord Kildare, and this plot, as ‘twill be called, was hatched within his walls. Will he forgive this? Will he forget? Truly, he might forget, were we to flee away in secret and give his wrath time to cool. Perchance it might not even be certain that I had ever landed in England, if we were to fly at once back to thy brother’s house. Faithful Martin here will in all things seek to keep the secret and administer the property in our absence. Beetel and his good wife will care for the boy as though he were their own. It will be, I trust, but for a short time; and when we know that the king’s wrath will no longer pursue us, we can come again and live in peace.”</p>

<p>Lady Hascombe’s eyes had dilated as the thought of her husband’s possible peril recurred to her mind. She looked nervously round the hall, as though enemies might be lurking in the shadows, and clasped her hands round her husband’s arm.</p>

<p>“Art thou indeed in peril, my beloved? Then let us fly. Let us lose not an hour. Ah, have I not suffered enough without this last fear? If they come and take thee from my side, and cast thee into the king’s prison, I must surely die!”</p>

<p>He put his arm around her trembling form, and drew her tenderly towards himself.</p>

<p>“I think in very sooth we had better be quickly gone, for our own sakes and that of young James, thy brother. But the journey will be long and toilsome, by sea as well as by land; and ‘twould be beyond the strength of any tender infant, even if we could have taken his foster-mother with us—a thing too much to ask even of the faithful Beetels—”</p>

<p>“But Mary will care for him as her own till we get back, or till he be old enough to be brought to us!” cried Lady Hascombe. “Good Mary loves him scarce less than her own. She will care for him and keep him as the apple of her eye. We need have no fear for him.”</p>

<p>“And thou canst bear to part from him?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, if it be for my husband’s sake. I cannot be parted from thee again, my life. That would kill me, in sooth. But if I know the boy is well cared for, I can leave him awhile. ‘Twill not be for long. Thy life and James’s may be in peril. Oh, let us not tarry!”</p>

<p>Not more than one day, sweetheart. To-morrow night shall see us far from here. But we must give young James this night for rest, else will he drop down by the way, and see his home no more. We will take horse and ride with all speed to the port of Bristol, and thence we will sail for Ireland. Thou wilt like to see thy childhood’s home again, sweet wife, and regain in thy brother’s halls the bloom which England has taken from thy cheeks.”</p>

<p>“I shall feel safe there,” answered Geraldine. “Here I often lie wakeful at night, fearing I know not what, but feeling as though some dread doom hung over me and mine. Let us away, and then perchance thou mayest make peace with the king’s majesty, and we may feel free and happy once more. But, oh, if thou hast been seen in arms against him in this rebellion, it may well be that shouldst thou linger thou mightest be torn from my side and taken I know not whither; and how could I live then?”</p>

<p>Her fears were very great. The anxieties she had suffered during the period of her husband’s absence had left their trace on her; the news of the death of her two brothers was another shock; and Lord Hascombe saw that, for every reason, the sudden departure would be the greatest relief to her, even though she had to leave her first-born babe behind. But in Lady Hascombe the maternal instinct was not very strongly developed as yet, whilst her passionate devotion to her husband was the mainspring of her being. She would gladly have taken horse that very hour; but he assured her there was no such pressing need for haste, and he had much to see to ere he left home again for an indeterminate period.</p>

<p>“And I must see the boy,” he said, his heart yearning towards the infant upon which his eyes had never yet rested.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, thou must see the boy,” answered the mother; and as she noted the weariness and exhaustion in her husband’s face, she tenderly begged him to leave all else, and secure the remainder of the night for sorely-needed repose.</p>

<p>So quiet and silence descended at last upon Hascombe Hall, whose lord and master had returned in such haste and secrecy in an hour of peril, only to make ready for a flight as hasty and as secret upon the morrow.</p>

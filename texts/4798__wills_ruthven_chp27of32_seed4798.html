<title>Chapter 27 of Laura Ruthven’s Widowhood by C. J. Wills</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">

<p>Mrs. Tunstall had fallen in love with Laura Ruthven. Most ladies living such a life of solitude or semi-solitude as Mrs. Tunstall had
led in her later years, generally indulge a passion for birds, or dogs, or monkeys —we have even heard of a widowed peeress in her own right, who kept a hutch of rabbits in her dressing-room, and fed them with tomatoes and asparagus. But Mrs. Tunstall had no pets. Once or twice the daughter of one or other of her old friends had pleased her ; but whether
or not Mrs. Tunstall’s imagination misled her, no sooner had these girls found themselves in her good graces than they had tried to step into those of her son ; and while Mrs. Tunstall sincerely desired that Meyrick should marry, she had no intention that he should be caught by some husband-hunting miss ; and so the incipient friendships had slipped back into the ordinary armed neutrality of polite society. With Laura Ruthven, Mrs. Tunstall felt safe. She was a widow, young certainly, and as pretty a girl as any old lady could fall in love with ; but the self-control and ingenuous frankness that marked our heroine’s walk and conversation, placed her, in Mrs. Tunstall’s estimation, on a totally different footing from the passing favourites that had disappointed her by developing designs on her deity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tunstall was cautious, however. She wanted to join this fresh young life to hers ; but before opening her heart to Laura Ruthven, Mrs. Tunstall got to know her intimately. She visited her often in her own house ; she went shopping with her, and she drove with her. She watched her in other people’s houses ; she even questioned Charlotte Walton about her ; above all, she brought about meetings between Laura Ruthven and her son. Meyrick Tunstall, observing that his mother had taken a fancy to the pretty young widow, paid her marked attention, and gradually began to like her. He found her judgment in art and literature totally untrained, and capable, according to his standard, of the most astounding mistakes, but often equally astounding in another way—for its truth and keenness, namely ; then she was so docile, so glad to be instructed, and yet so
determined in defence of points or prejudices, that, like a true woman, she could not give up, arguing without the least skill, but picking up a
pebble here and a dart there and flinging them with both hands, until even Meyrick grew bewildered in the quickness and variety of the discharge ; so innocent, and yet experienced ; so sweet, and lovely, and good-tempered ; with a gradual-growing strength behind it all, and an
unbending uprightness that no sophistry could overthrow ; she was so unlike the other women whom he was in the habit of meeting almost exclusively now, so utterly regardless of his pedestalled position, so joyous and bright and always so glad to see him, and above all, so
utterly “undesigning ” in all she did and said, that Meyrick Tunstall grew to look upon her as his best friend : an hour or two of her company was to him, weary with flattery and jaded with the shrieking concert-pitch to which we have in this <em>fin de siécle</em> screwed up thought and speculation, as refreshing as a plunge in the sea or a walk up a Welsh mountain.</p>

<p>He had never had a sister, nor had he ever made an intimate comrade of any man : it was a novelty for him, his friendship with Laura Ruthven ; and he thought he enjoyed it in the same way as he enjoyed a new piece of music or a new picture, and yet she was no Egeria. As for Laura Ruthven, she had had a somewhat remarkable experience.</p>

<p>That which she had told herself would never again dawn for her, had flashed, for a brief moment, if not like the beams of morning, then like a brilliant meteor, once more across her heart. ” Once more,” she said to herself, for she confessed it ; <em>we</em> think it was for the first time. As she had sat spell-bound by the beauty and expression of Meyrick Tunstall’s face during Olive Van Tassel’s playing, while the heart-searching music passed through him to her, her brain had begun to reel and her blood to beat with a wild intoxication which, she told herself afterwards, she knew by experience to be love. We think she deceived herself. Passion had had no part in the affection which John Ruthven had inspired in her ; and it was a draught of passion that she had
drunk for one heedless moment—a sip at least from the magic goblet that even the most abstinent lips must touch once in a lifetime. But when she knew what sweet poison had tingled along her veins, she put the cup by, as
many a one has done before. Love, it is said, likes best when his crystal beaker, with the red wine and the pearly beads creaming at the rim, is set aside ; for he knows —that it will be tasted again and again, and he knows by experience that those are the truest lovers who linger over the draught. Love at first sight ? Oh, yes : ” Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?” But which is the first sight ? Men and women who have known and been indifferent to each other for years fall in love, and if you ask them they’ll tell you, and justly, that it was at first sight ; by which they either mean that a glance of the eyes exchanged the revelation of their love, becoming the “first sight ” <em>of love,</em> or—
and this is more common than the other—that they have deceived themselves into the belief that they have always loved even before they
had even seen each other : for Love, no matter though his name be now changed from a mythological to a physiological one, is the same blind wonder-working little Cupid as of old, the greatest conjurer the world has ever seen. Balls, and knives, and vanishing ladies, quotha ! Why, there is an ancient trick of his, one of his first inventions, “as easy as lying,” yet impossible to any artist of the wizard’s calling, and that is the union of May and December. It is true, he requires an assistant—gold ; but that is “the only mechanical means employed.” One of his most notable feats, and a feat performed much oftener than the world imagines, is that of making someone love, leave off, and begin again. Examine yourself, gentle reader. Have you never at any period of your life, seen and loved for a brief space, that neverceasing wonder, one of the opposite sex—we speak by the card—and then after a day or a week the lovely or manly vision lost its attraction ? And will you deny that that brief love was as ardent and true as the passion that now consumes you for the sweet-tempered, baldheaded mutton-eater you call husband, or the grey-haired fairy with the ample bodice and the elevated voice who is the mother of your children ? You grant then, with heretical tremblings, but anxious only for the truth, that love, true love can begin, and stop. It is a heresy, you know, for the dogma is that only the love that endures forever is the true love. But you grant it. Go a step farther. Did you never meet the individual of the opposite sex mentioned above long
after all recollection even of the interval of passion had passed away, and find yourself suddenly in the old predicament ? You have ? Of course you have. Your assent emboldens us, and we will put a question implying a depth of scepticism that would appal a fainter heart than yours. Is it,
or is it not, the case that you fell in and out of love, three times at least, with your husband or wife before marriage ? Afterwards, of course we know—even the most sceptical know, such a thing is an impossibility.
We do not mean when we say that you fell out of love, a mere lover’s quarrel ; but an actual ceasing to care two straws what tie you wore in
Araminta’s presence, and an utter indifference as to Orlando’s opinion of the style in which your hair was dressed. Is it, or is it not the case ?
We pause for a reply, and proceed with our story.</p>

<p>Laura Ruthven loved Meyrick Tunstall that evening in his mother’s drawing-room ; and her whole being was shaken by the suddenness of it, the wonder, and the glamour. But before she left Mrs. Tunstall’s house, “brief as the lightning in the collied night,” the blaze of passion had died out ; and there was more than one reason why it should have done so. There was first of all the resolute little lady herself—she had made a vow never to marry ; and therefore of course never to fall in love ; and she had taken herself severely to task when the music was over. Then Meyrick Tunstall had talked eagerly with Olive Van Tassel ; and then Lady Fullalove had called. The hatred and loathing that Laura Ruthven still felt for that woman extended to her friends —her male friends, that is
; and when she learned the relation that existed, or had existed between Meyrick Tunstall and Marcia Fullalove, she began to doubt his mother. That, however, did not outlive two meetings with Mrs. Tunstall. But we can
best indicate Laura Ruthven’s attitude towards Meyrick Tunstall by a scrap of conversation between her and Charlotte Walton.</p>

<p>” Do you remember, Charlotte,” said Laura, “long ago, when we first became acquainted, how we talked about men, and the possibility of being close friends with them without falling in love ?”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Charlotte. “You said it was possible, and I said it wasn’t ; and I, of course, had the best of the argument.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>” Of course I had,” said Charlotte merrily. ” But I suppose you think you have the best of it now.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean ?”</p>

<p>“A certain editor and a certain widow seem to have brought the impossible to pass.”</p>

<p>“But is it so noticeable?” asked Laura Ruthven with some anxiety and a little blush.</p>

<p>” Anybody can see that Meyrick Tunstall prefers your society to that of anybody else.”</p>

<p>” But do you think he does ? It seems to me that he talks to others as much as to me.”</p>

<p>That’s only because you want to get him all to yourself,” thought Charlotte ; but she didn’t say it.</p>

<p>” And then,” continued Laura Ruthven, “his mother, Charlotte. Why, the man’s in love with his mother. You may be as sceptical as you like, Charlotte, but Meyrick Tunstall and I have not the least little scrap
of love for each other. How could he possibly ever love poor little me?
It is just because he feels certain that I don’t love him, and will never do such a foolish thing, that we are so friendly. I am a little ignorant fool, and it pleases him to talk to me. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“And you’re certain you don’t love him?”</p>

<p>” Quite, Charlotte. Don’t you see, dear, that he’s not the kind of man that I should fancy, supposing I could possibly love again. Why, now—always supposing that you know—I could fall in love comfortably with— such a fine boy as Harry Summers, if he were only a little older. He has no past ; nothing to hide. But Meyrick Tunstall, with his Olive Van Tassels and his Lady Fullaloves in the background—a most interesting, sometimes a most exciting, friend —is— the last man, I, with my experience, should dream of loving.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Tunstall, watching her son and Laura Ruthven together, came to the same conclusion, and took the pretty young widow to her heart, satisfied at last that she had found a frank, open, “undesigning ” nature,
such as she had sought in vain for so many years.</p>

<p>Now, it had been determined for some time that Laura Ruthven and Charlotte Walton should be taken by Mrs. Tunstall to visit her son at his chambers. Meyrick had been asked repeatedly to appoint a day, but had always evaded doing so. He himself could not have given any very definite
reason why he felt uneasy at the idea of this visit ; but the uneasiness was there, and he could not overcome it. Afterwards, in reviewing this period of his life, he said it had been a premonition of his approaching
fate ; but the reader will be able to judge how far that idea is consistent with truth before our story is ended. Failing an appointment, Mrs. Tunstall took the matter into her own hands ; and one afternoon
when Laura Ruthven and Charlotte Walton called she invited them to drive with her; and, without telling them where they were going, took them straight to her son’s rooms.</p>

<p>Meyrick Tunstall’s chambers were to a certain extent a show place. There were valuable things, beautiful things, and innumerable “joys for ever” on his shelves, on his walls, and beneath his feet—Tunstall was one of those men who couldn’t work without his surroundings —that was one of his imperfections. He needed his particular chair, his particular table, he even used a particular kind of pen, and affected a special
ink, and he liked to feast his eyes upon what he considered the beautiful ; his carpets were priceless Eastern rugs, his few pictures were very good of their kind, and the dearest of all to him was Frank Holt’s portrait of his mother which hung over the Queen Anne grate in the place of honour. There were cases of miniatures, great portfolios of etchings and water-colours, and a hideous print of the “Temptation of St. Anthony,” with a peculiarly vivid rendering of the devil that did much credit to M. Callott’s invention. There were Gilray and Rowlands in
caricatures, and a few framed drawings by Cruikshank ; and there hung a heterogeneous collection of ideal beauties on the journalist’s walls which puzzled you.</p>

<p>“When I see a pretty face or a lovely form, I buy it as a sort of duty,” —the owner of the rooms would explain. “One may remember a quotation or a phrase, but it’s so easy to forget a face.”</p>

<p>The walls were hung so thickly that they were absolutely hidden ; and valuable works of art jostled common prints, photographs, and statuettes, that were merely pegs on which hung happy memories.</p>

<p>Tunstall could work comfortably in his own place. “No cock,” he would say, “can be so happy, or crow so loudly, as when on his own—eminence.”</p>

<p>That was one of Tunstall’s weak points ; he couldn’t crow on paper anywhere else.</p>

<p>Some men can work in a stifling atmosphere of printer’s ink and gas, to the monotonous tune of a steam-press —it’s all one to them ; their eyes don’t travel off the sheet of lined foolscap in front of them ; but
with Tunstall it was different ; he could only work at his own rooms—being, as he put it, a limpet who was only happy on his own rock. He liked his sumptuous surroundings, the society of his numerous wellbound
books, his first editions, and the air of mingled luxury and homeliness ;
he liked his double-windows and the painted glass that shut out the world ; and he liked the flowers that were replaced ere they began to fade,
and the flowering plants renewed by the florist for a yearly dole ;
he liked the heavy old library furniture, that looked as if it never could wear out, and the old-world bookcases and glazed cupboards of darkest oak with their diamond panes; and he liked the little square
“Broadwood grand ” that stood in a recess on which fair and dexterous
fingers had made music for him in his hours of idleness ; and he revelled in the mixed odours of tobacco, sandal- wood, and <em>pot pourri,</em> which
hung about the Arabian smoking-room, which opened out of the study through a latticed partition of carved wood, and the low divans covered with strange rugs and skins of beasts flung there with simulated negligence, and the little, yellow marble fountain that flashed and bubbled in its midst, and the fern paradise which looked like a glorious
picture in a frame behind a sheet of plateglass. Beyond the study there was a tiny dining-room, where you might dine four people, and whose only ornaments was a small carved sideboard, a picture of still life and birds, by Hondekœter, and a candelabrum in silver of old Dutch work, which
held half-a-dozen wax candles. There was a bedroom, a bathroom, and a servants’ room beyond.</p>

<p>They were heavily rented these chambers of Tunstall’s, being on the first floor of the Albany ; but the dun, the bore, the casual acquaintance, the interviewer, the earnest inquirer and the indignant contributor, could never penetrate to disturb the rest of Meyrick Tunstall ; and the smiling man-servant kept to his consign. <em>No visitors</em> —except some half-dozen cronies of his master’s, or people who called by appointment ; and, wonder of wonders, the man’s mother, his best and dearest friend.</p>

Hyacinth hurried down and got out of the house, but he had not the least
intention of losing sight of Schinkel. The odd behaviour of the Poupins was a
surprise and annoyance, and he had wished to shake himself free from it. He was
candidly astonished at the alarm they were so good as to feel for him, for he
had never perceived that they had gone round to the hope that the note he had
signed (as it were) to Hoffendahl would not be presented. What had he said,
what had he done, after all, to give them the right to fasten on him the charge
of apostasy? He had always been a free critic of everything, and it was natural
that, on certain occasions, in the little parlour in
Lisson Grove,
he should have spoken in accordance with that freedom; but it was only with
the Princess that he had permitted himself really to rail at the democracy and
given the full measure of his scepticism. He would have thought it indelicate
to express contempt for the opinions of his old foreign friends, to whom
associations that made them venerable were attached; and, moreover, for
Hyacinth, a change of heart was, in the nature of things, much more an occasion
for a hush of publicity and a kind of retrospective reserve; it couldn’t
prompt one to aggression or jubilation. When one had but lately discovered what
could be said on the
<!-- start of vol. 3, page 190 in source -->
opposite side one didn’t want to boast of one’s sharpness —
not even when one’s new convictions cast shadows that looked like the
ghosts of the old.</p>

<p>
Hyacinth lingered in the street, a certain distance from the house, watching
for Schinkel’s exit and prepared to remain there if necessary till the
dawn of another day. He had said to his friends, just before, that the manner
in which the communication they looked so askance at should reach him was none
of his business — it might reach him as it could. This was true enough
in theory, but in fact his desire was overwhelming to know what Madame Poupin
had meant by her allusion to a letter, destined for him, in Schinkel’s
possession — an allusion confirmed by Schinkel’s own virtual
acknowledgment. It was indeed this eagerness that had driven him out of the
house, for he had reason to believe that the German would not fail him, and it
galled his suspense to see the foolish Poupins try to interpose, to divert the
missive from its course. He waited and waited, in the faith that Schinkel was
dealing with them in his slow, categorical Teutonic way, and only objurgated
the cabinet-maker for having in the first place paltered with his sacred trust.
Why hadn’t he come straight to him — whatever the mysterious
document was — instead of talking it over with French featherheads?
Passers were rare, at this hour, in
Lisson Grove,
and lights were mainly extinguished; there was nothing to look at but the vista
of the low black houses, the dim, interspaced street-lamps, the prowling cats
who darted occasionally across the road, and the terrible, mysterious, far-off
stars, which appeared to him more than ever to see everything and to tell
nothing. A policeman creaked along on the opposite side of the way, looking
<!-- start of vol. 3, page 191 in source -->
across at him as he passed, and stood for some minutes on the corner, as if to
keep an eye on him. Hyacinth had leisure to reflect that the day was perhaps
not far off when a policeman might have his eye on him for a very good reason
— might walk up and down, pass and repass, as he mounted guard over
him.</p>

<p>
It seemed horribly long before Schinkel came out of the house, but it was
probably only half an hour. In the stillness of the street he heard Poupin let
his visitor out, and at the sound he stepped back into the recess of a doorway
on the same side, so that, in looking out, the Frenchman should not see
him waiting. There was another delay, for the two stood talking together
interminably and in a low tone on the doorstep. At last, however, Poupin went
in again, and then Schinkel came down the street towards Hyacinth, who had
calculated that he would proceed in that direction, it being, as Hyacinth
happened to know, that of his own lodging. After he had heard Poupin go in he
stopped and looked up and down; it was evidently his idea that Hyacinth would
be waiting for him. Our hero stepped out of the shallow recess in which he had
been flattening himself, and came straight to him, and the two men stood there
face to face, in the dusky, empty, sordid street.</p>

<p>
“You didn’t let them have the letter?”</p>

<p>
“Oh no, I retained it,” said Schinkel, with his eyes more than ever
like invisible points.</p>

<p>
“Then hadn’t you better give it to me?”</p>

<p>
“We will talk of that — we will talk.” Schinkel made no
motion to satisfy his friend; he had his hands in the pockets of his trousers,
and his appearance was characterised
<!-- start of vol. 3, page 192 in source -->
by an exasperating assumption that they had the whole night before them. He was
intolerably methodical.</p>

<p>
“Why should we talk? Haven’t you talked enough with those people,
all the evening? What have they to say about it? What right have you to detain
a letter that belongs to me?”</p>

<p>
“<i>Erlauben Sie</i>:
I will light my pipe,” the German remarked. And he proceeded to this
business, methodically, while Hyacinth’s pale, excited face showed
in the glow of the match that he ignited on the rusty railing beside them.
“It is not yours unless I have given it to you,” Schinkel went on,
as they walked along. “Be patient, and I will tell you,” he added,
passing his hand into his companion’s arm. “Your way, not so? We
will go down toward
the Park.”
Hyacinth tried to be patient, and he listened with interest when Schinkel said,
“She tried to take it; she attacked me with her hands. But that was not
what I went for, to give it up.”</p>

<p>
“Is she mad? I don’t recognise them,” Hyacinth murmured.</p>

<p>
“No, but they
lofe
you.”</p>

<p>
“Why, then, do they try to disgrace me?”</p>

<p>
“They think it is no disgrace, if you have changed.”</p>

<p>
“That’s very well for her; but it’s pitiful for him, and I
declare it surprises me.”</p>

<p>
“Oh, he came round, and he helped me to resist. He pulled his wife off.
It was the first shock,” said Schinkel.</p>

<p>
“You oughtn’t to have shocked them, my dear fellow,”
Hyacinth replied.</p>

<p>
“I was shocked myself — I couldn’t help it.”</p>

<!-- start of vol. 3, page 193 in source -->
<p>
“Lord, how shaky you all are!”</p>

<p>
“You take it well. I am very sorry. But it is a fine chance,”
Schinkel went on, smoking away. His pipe, for the moment, seemed to absorb him,
so that after a silence Hyacinth resumed —</p>

<p>
“Be so good as to reflect that all this while I don’t in the least
understand what you are talking about.”</p>

<p>
“Well, it was this morning, early,” said the German. “You
know in my country we don’t lie in bed late, and what they do in my
country I try to do everywhere. I think it is good enough. In winter I get up,
of course, long before the sun, and in summer I get up almost at the same time.
I should see the fine spectacle of the sunrise, if in London you could see. The
first thing I do of a Sunday is to smoke a pipe at my window, which is at the
front, you remember, and looks into a little dirty street. At that hour there
is nothing to see there — you English are so slow to leave the bed. Not
much, however, at any time; it is not important, my little street. But my first
pipe is the one I enjoy most. I want nothing else when I have that pleasure. I
look out at the new, fresh light — though in London it is not very fresh
— and I think it is the beginning of another day. I wonder what such a
day will bring; whether it will bring anything good to us poor devils. But
I have seen a great many pass, and nothing has come. This morning, however,
brought something — something, at least, to you. On the other side of the
way I saw a young man, who stood just opposite to my house, looking up at my
window. He looked at me straight, without any ceremony, and I smoked my pipe
and looked at him. I wondered what he wanted, but he made no sign and spoke no
word. He was a very
<!-- start of vol. 3, page 194 in source -->
nice young man; he had an umbrella, and he wore spectacles. We remained that
way, face to face, perhaps for a quarter of an hour, and at last he took out
his watch — he had a watch, too — and held it in his hand, just
glancing at it every few minutes, as if to let me know that he would rather
not give me the whole day. Then it came over me that he wanted to speak to me!
You would have guessed that before, but we good Germans are slow. When we
understand, however, we act; so I nodded to him, to let him know I would come
down. I put on my coat and my shoes, for I was only in my shirt and stockings
(though of course I had on my trousers), and I went down into the street. When
he saw me come he walked slowly away, but at the end of a little distance he
waited for me. When I came near him I saw that he was a very nice young man
indeed — very young, with a very pleasant, friendly face. He was also
very neat, and he had gloves, and his umbrella was of silk. I liked him very
much. He said I should come round the corner, so we went round the corner
together. I thought there would be some one there waiting for us; but there was
nothing — only the closed shops and the early light and a little spring
mist which told that the day would be fine. I didn’t know what he
wanted; perhaps it was some of our business — that’s what I first
thought — and perhaps it was only a little game. So I was very careful;
I didn’t ask him to come into the house. Yet I told him that he must
excuse me for not understanding more quickly that he wished to speak with me;
and when I said that, he said it was not of consequence — he would have
waited there, for the chance to see me all day. I told him I was glad I had
spared him that, at least, and we
<!-- start of vol. 3, page 195 in source -->
had some very polite conversation. He <i>was</i> a very nice young man. But
what he wanted was simply to put a letter in my hand; as he said himself,
he was only a kind of private postman. He gave me the letter — it was
not addressed; and when I had taken it I asked him how he knew, and if he
wouldn’t be sorry if it should turn out that I was not the man for whom
the letter was meant. But I didn’t give him a start; he told me he knew
all it was necessary for him to know — he knew exactly what to do and how
to do it. I think he is a valuable member. I asked him if the letter required
an answer, and he told me he had nothing to do with that; he was only to put it
in my hand. He recommended me to wait till I had gone into the house again to
read it. We had a little more talk — always very polite; and he mentioned
that he had come so early because he thought I might go out, if he delayed,
and because, also, he had a great deal to do and had to take his time when he
could. It is true that he looked as if he had plenty to do — as if he
was in some very good occupation. I should tell you that he spoke to me always
in English, but he is not English; he sounded his words like some kind of
foreigner. I suppose he is not German, or he would have spoken to me in German.
But there are so many, of all countries! I said if he had so much to do I
wouldn’t keep him; I would go to my room and open my letter. He said it
wasn’t important; and then I asked him if he wouldn’t come into
my room, also, and rest. I told him it wasn’t very handsome, my room
— because he looked like a young man who would have, for himself, a very
neat lodging. Then I found he meant it wasn’t important that we should
talk any more, and he went
<!-- start of vol. 3, page 196 in source -->
away without even offering to shake hands. I don’t know if he had other
letters to give, but he went away, as I have said, like a postman on his
rounds, without giving me any more information.”</p>

<p>
It took Schinkel a long time to unfold this story — his calm and
conscientious thoroughness made no allowance for any painful acuteness of
curiosity that Hyacinth might feel. He went from step to step, and treated his
different points with friendly explicitness, as if each would have exactly the
same interest for his companion. The latter made no attempt to hurry him, and
indeed he listened, now, with a kind of intense patience; for he <i>was</i>
interested, and, moreover, it was clear to him that he was safe with Schinkel;
the German would satisfy him in time — wouldn’t worry him with
attaching conditions to their transaction, in spite of the mistake he had made
in going for guidance to
Lisson Grove.
Hyacinth learned in due course that on returning to his apartment and opening
the little packet of which he had been put into possession, Mr Schinkel
had found himself confronted with two separate articles: one a sealed letter
superscribed with our young man’s name, the other a sheet of paper
containing in three lines a request that within two days of receiving it he
would hand the letter to the ‘young Robinson’. The three lines in
question were signed D. H., and the letter was addressed in the same hand.
Schinkel professed that he already knew the writing; it was that of Diedrich
Hoffendahl. “Good, good,” he said, exerting a soothing pressure
upon Hyacinth’s arm. “I will walk with you to your door, and I
will give it to you there; unless you like better that I should keep it till
to-morrow morning, so
<!-- start of vol. 3, page 197 in source -->
that you may have a quiet sleep — I mean in case it might contain
anything that will be disagreeable to you. But it is probably nothing; it is
probably only a word to say that you need think no more about your
engagement.”</p>

<p>
“Why should it be that?” Hyacinth asked.</p>

<p>
“Probably he has heard that you repent.”</p>

<p>
“That I repent?” Hyacinth stopped him short; they had just reached
the top of
Park Lane.
“To whom have I given a right to say that?”</p>

<p>
“Ah well, if you haven’t, so much the better. It may be, then, for
some other reason.”</p>

<p>
“Don’t be an idiot, Schinkel,” Hyacinth returned, as they
walked along. And in a moment he went on, “What the devil did you go and
tattle to the Poupins for?”</p>

<p>
“Because I thought they would like to know. Besides, I felt my
responsibility; I thought I should carry it better if they knew it. And then,
I’m like them — I
lofe you.”</p>

<p>
Hyacinth made no answer to this profession; he asked the next instant,
“Why didn’t your young man bring the letter directly to
me?”</p>

<p>
“Ah, I didn’t ask him that! The reason was probably not
complicated, but simple — that those who wrote it knew my address and
didn’t know yours. And wasn’t I one of your
guarantors?”</p>

<p>
“Yes, but not the principal one. The principal one was Muniment. Why was
the letter not sent to me through him?”</p>

<p>
“My dear Robinson, you want to know too many things. Depend upon it,
there are always good reasons. I should have liked it better if it had been
Muniment. But if they didn’t send to him—” Schinkel
interrupted
himself;
<!-- start of vol. 3, page 198 in source -->
the remainder of his sentence was lost in a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>
“Well, if they didn’t send to him,” — Hyacinth
persisted.</p>

<p>
“You’re a great friend of his — how can I tell
you?”</p>

<p>
At this Hyacinth looked up at his companion askance, and caught an odd glance,
accompanied with a smile, which the mild, circumspect German directed toward
him. “If it’s anything against him, my being his friend makes me
just the man to hear it. I can defend him.”</p>

<p>
“Well, it’s a possibility that they are not satisfied.”</p>

<p>
“How do you mean it — not satisfied?”</p>

<p>
“How shall I say it? — that they don’t trust him.”</p>

<p>
“Don’t trust him? And yet they trust me!”</p>

<p>
“Ah, my boy, depend upon it, there are reasons,” Schinkel replied;
and in a moment he added, “They know everything — everything. Oh,
they go straight!”</p>

<p>
The pair pursued the rest of their course for the most part in silence,
Hyacinth being considerably struck with something that dropped from his
companion in answer to a question he asked as to what Eustache Poupin had said
when Schinkel, that evening, first told him what he had come to see him about.
“<i>Il
vaut du galme — il vaut du galme</i>:”
that was the German’s version of the Frenchman’s words; and
Hyacinth repeated them over to himself several times, almost with the same
accent. They had a certain soothing effect. In fact the good Schinkel was
soothing altogether, as our hero felt when they stopped at last at the door of
his lodging in Westminster and stood there face to face, while Hyacinth waited
— waited. The sharpness of his impatience had passed away, and he watched
without irritation the loving manner in which the German shook the ashes out of
<!-- start of vol. 3, page 199 in source -->
his big pipe and laid it to rest in its coffin. It was only after he had gone
through this business with his usual attention to every detail of it that he
said,
“<i>Also</i>,
now for the letter,” and, putting his hand inside of his waistcoat, drew
forth the important document. It passed instantly into Hyacinth’s grasp,
and our young man transferred it to his own pocket without looking at it. He
thought he saw a shade of disappointment in Schinkel’s ugly, kindly
face, at this indication that he should have no present knowledge of its
contents; but he liked that better than his pretending to say again that it was
nothing — that it was only a release. Schinkel had now the good sense, or
the good taste, not to repeat that remark, and as the letter pressed against
his heart Hyacinth felt still more distinctly that it was something —
that it was a
command. What Schinkel did say, in a moment, was: “Now that you
have got it, I am very glad. It is more comfortable for me.”</p>

<p>
“I should think so!” Hyacinth exclaimed. “If you
hadn’t done your job you would have paid for it.”</p>

<p>
Schinkel hesitated a moment while he lingered; then, as Hyacinth turned away,
putting in his door-key, he replied, “And if you don’t do yours,
so will you.”</p>

<p>
“Yes, as you say, <i>they</i> go straight! Good-night.” And our
young man let himself in.</p>

<p>
The passage and staircase were never lighted, and the lodgers either groped
their way bedward with the infallibility of practice or scraped the wall with a
casual match which, in the milder gloom of day, was visible in a hundred rich
streaks. Hyacinth’s room was on the second floor, behind, and as he
approached it he was startled by seeing a light proceed from the crevice under
the door, the imperfect
<!-- start of vol. 3, page 200 in source -->
fitting of which was in this manner vividly illustrated. He stopped and
considered this mysterious brightness, and his first impulse was to connect it
with the incident just ushered in by Schinkel; for what could anything that
touched him now be but a part of the same business? It was natural that some
punctual emissary should be awaiting him. Then it occurred to him that when he
went out to call on Lady Aurora, after tea, he had simply left a tallow candle
burning, and that it showed a cynical spirit on the part of his landlady, who
could be so close-fisted for herself, not to have gone in and put it out.
Lastly, it came over him that he had had a visitor, in his absence, and that
the visitor had taken possession of his apartment till his return, seeking
sources of comfort, as was perfectly just. When he opened the door he found
that this last prevision was the right one, though his visitor was not one of
the figures that had risen before him. Mr Vetch sat there, beside the
little table at which Hyacinth did his writing, with his head resting on his
hand and his eyes bent on the floor. He looked up when Hyacinth appeared, and
said, “Oh, I didn’t hear you; you are very quiet.”</p>

<p>
“I come in softly, when I’m late, for the sake of the house
— though I am bound to say I am the only lodger who has that refinement.
Besides, you have been asleep,” Hyacinth said.</p>

<p>
“No, I have not been asleep,” returned the old man. “I
don’t sleep much nowadays.”</p>

<p>
“Then you have been plunged in meditation.”</p>

<p>
“Yes, I have been thinking.” Then Mr Vetch explained that the
woman of the house wouldn’t let him come in, at first, till he had given
proper assurances that his intentions
<!-- start of vol. 3, page 201 in source -->
were pure and that he was moreover the oldest friend Mr Robinson had in
the world. He had been there for an hour; he thought he might find him, coming
so late.</p>

<p>
Hyacinth answered that he was very glad he had waited and that he was delighted
to see him, and expressed regret that he hadn’t known in advance of his
visit, so that he might have something to offer him. He sat down on his bed,
vaguely expectant; he wondered what special purpose had brought the fiddler so
far at that unnatural hour. But he only spoke the truth in saying that he was
glad to see him. Hyacinth had come upstairs in a tremor of desire to be alone
with the revelation that he carried in his pocket, yet the sight of Anastasius
Vetch gave him a sudden relief by postponing solitude. The place where he had
put his letter seemed to throb against his side, yet he was thankful to his
old friend for forcing him still to leave it so. “I have been looking at
your books,” the fiddler said; “you have two or three exquisite
specimens of your own. Oh yes, I recognise your work when I see it; there are
always certain little finer touches. You have a manner, like a master. With
such a talent, such a taste, your future leaves nothing to be desired. You will
make a fortune and become a great celebrity.”</p>

<p>
Mr Vetch sat forward, to sketch this vision; he rested his hands on his
knees and looked very hard at his young friend, as if to challenge him to
dispute his flattering views. The effect of what Hyacinth saw in his face was
to give him immediately the idea that the fiddler knew something, though it was
impossible to guess how he could know it. The Poupins, for instance, had had
no time to communicate with him, even granting that they were capable of that
baseness;
<!-- start of vol. 3, page 202 in source -->
an unwarrantable supposition, in spite of Hyacinth’s having seen them,
less than an hour before, fall so much below their own standard. With this
suspicion there rushed into Hyacinth’s mind an intense determination to
dissemble before his visitor to the last; he might imagine what he liked, but
he should not have a grain of satisfaction — or rather he should have
that of being led to believe, if possible, that his suspicions were positively
vain and idle. Hyacinth rested his eyes on the books that Mr Vetch had
taken down from the shelf, and admitted that they were very pretty work and
that so long as one didn’t become blind or maimed the ability to produce
that sort of thing was a legitimate source of confidence. Then suddenly,
as they continued simply to look at each other, the pressure of the old
man’s curiosity, the expression of his probing, beseeching eyes, which
had become strange and tragic in these latter times and completely changed
their character, grew so intolerable that to defend himself Hyacinth took the
aggressive and asked him boldly whether it were simply to look at his work,
of which he had half a dozen specimens in Lomax Place, that he had made a
nocturnal pilgrimage. “My dear old friend, you have something on your
mind — some fantastic fear, some extremely erroneous
<i>
idée fixe</i>.
Why has it taken you to-night, in particular? Whatever it is, it has brought
you here, at an unnatural hour, you don’t know why. I ought of course to
be thankful to anything that brings you here; and so I am, in so far as that it
makes me happy. But I can’t like it if it makes <i>you</i> miserable.
You’re like a nervous mother whose baby’s in bed upstairs; she
goes up every five minutes to see if he’s all right — if he
isn’t uncovered or hasn’t tumbled out of bed. Dear Mr
<!-- start of vol. 3, page 203 in source -->
Vetch, don’t, don’t worry; the blanket’s up to my chin,
and I haven’t tumbled yet.”</p>

<p>
Hyacinth heard himself say these things as if he were listening to another
person; the impudence of them, under the circumstances, seemed to him, somehow,
so rare. But he believed himself to be on the edge of an episode in which
impudence, evidently, must play a considerable part, and he might as well try
his hand at it without delay. The way the old man gazed at him might have
indicated that he too was able to take the measure of his perversity —
that he knew he was false as he sat there declaring that there was nothing the
matter, while a brand-new revolutionary commission burned in his pocket. But in
a moment Mr Vetch said, very mildly, as if he had really been reassured,
“It’s wonderful how you read my thoughts. I don’t trust
you; I think there are beastly possibilities. It’s not true, at any
rate, that I come to look at you every five minutes. You don’t know how
often I have resisted my fears — how I have forced myself to let you
alone.”</p>

<p>
“You had better let me come and live with you, as I proposed after
Pinnie’s death. Then you will have me always under your eyes,”
said Hyacinth, smiling.</p>

<p>
The old man got up eagerly, and, as Hyacinth did the same, laid his hands upon
his shoulders, holding him close. “Will you now, really, my boy? Will you
come to-night?”</p>

<p>
“To-night, Mr Vetch?”</p>

<p>
“To-night has worried me more than any other, I don’t know why.
After my tea I had my pipe and a glass, but I couldn’t keep quiet; I was
very, very bad. I got to thinking of Pinnie — she seemed to be in the
room. I felt as if I could put out my hand and touch her. If I believed
<!-- start of vol. 3, page 204 in source -->
in ghosts I should believe I had seen her. She wasn’t there for nothing;
she was there to add her fears to mine — to talk to me about you. I tried
to hush her up, but it was no use — she drove me out of the house. About
ten o’clock I took my hat and stick and came down here. You may judge
whether I thought it important, as I took a cab.”</p>

<p>
“Ah, why do you spend your money so foolishly?” asked Hyacinth, in
a tone of the most affectionate remonstrance.</p>

<p>
“Will you come to-night?” said the old man, for all rejoinder,
holding him still.</p>

<p>
“Surely, it would be simpler for you to stay here. I see perfectly that
you are ill and nervous. You can take the bed, and I’ll spend the night
in the chair.”</p>

<p>
The fiddler thought a moment. “No, you’ll hate me if I subject you
to such discomfort as that; and that’s just what I don’t
want.”</p>

<p>
“It won’t be a bit different in your room; there, as here, I shall
have to sleep in a chair.”</p>

<p>
“I’ll get another room; we shall be close together,” the
fiddler went on.</p>

<p>
“Do you mean you’ll get another room at this hour of the night,
with your little house stuffed full and your people all in bed? My poor
Anastasius, you are very bad; your reason totters on its throne,” said
Hyacinth, humorously and indulgently.</p>

<p>
“Very good, we’ll get a room to-morrow. I’ll move into
another house, where there are two, side by side.” Hyacinth’s tone
was evidently soothing to him.</p>

<p>
“<i>Comme vous y allez</i>!”
the young man continued.
<!-- start of vol. 3, page 205 in source -->
“Excuse me if I remind you that in case of my leaving this place I have
to give a fortnight’s notice.”</p>

<p>
“Ah, you’re backing out!” the old man exclaimed, dropping
his hands.</p>

<p>
“Pinnie wouldn’t have said that,” Hyacinth returned.
“If you are acting, if you are speaking, at the prompting of her pure
spirit, you had better act and speak exactly as she would have done. She would
have believed me.”</p>

<p>
“Believed you? Believed what? What is there to believe? If you’ll
make me a promise, I will believe that.”</p>

<p>
“I’ll make you any promise you like,” said Hyacinth.</p>

<p>
“Oh, any promise I like — that isn’t what I want! I want
just one very particular little pledge; and that is really what I came here for
to-night. It came over me that I’ve been an ass, all this time, never to
have demanded it of you before. Give it to me now, and I will go home quietly
and leave you in peace.” Hyacinth, assenting in advance, requested again
that he would formulate his demand, and then the old man said, “Well,
promise me that you will never, under any circumstances whatever, do
anything.”</p>

<p>
“Do anything?”</p>

<p>
“Anything that those people expect of you.”</p>

<p>
“Those people?” Hyacinth repeated.</p>

<p>
“Ah, don’t torment me with pretending not to understand!”
the old man begged. “You know the people I mean. I can’t call them
by their names, because I don’t know them. But you do, and they know
you.”</p>

<p>
Hyacinth had no desire to torment Mr Vetch, but he was capable of
reflecting that to enter into his thought too easily would be tantamount to
betraying himself. “I suppose I know the people you have in mind,”
he said, in a
<!-- start of vol. 3, page 206 in source -->
moment; “but I’m afraid I don’t grasp the idea of the
promise.”</p>

<p>
“Don’t they want to make use of you?”</p>

<p>
“I see what you mean,” said Hyacinth. “You think they want me
to touch off some train for them. Well, if that’s what troubles you, you
may sleep sound. I shall never do any of their work.”</p>

<p>
A radiant light came into the fiddler’s face, and he stared, as if this
assurance were too fair for nature. “Do you take your oath on that? Never
anything, anything, anything?”</p>

<p>
“Never anything at all.”</p>

<p>
“Will you swear it to me by the memory of that good woman of whom we have
been speaking and whom we both loved?”</p>

<p>
“My dear old Pinnie’s memory? Willingly.”</p>

<p>
The old man sank down in his chair and buried his face in his hands; the next
moment his companion heard him sobbing. Ten minutes later he was content to
take his departure, and Hyacinth went out with him to look for another cab.
They found an ancient
four-wheeler
stationed languidly at a crossing of the
ways, and before Mr Vetch got into it he asked his young friend to kiss
him. That young friend watched the vehicle get itself into motion and rattle
away; he saw it turn a neighbouring corner. Then he approached the nearest
gas-lamp and drew from his breast-pocket the letter that Schinkel had given
him.</p>

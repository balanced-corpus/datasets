<!--CHAPTER 23.<br>—ON THEIR EXTINCTION-->
<div>
<p>
<i>Lunch Time. At that unaccustomed hour, the master of the house (Mr. Naggleton) has returned from the City. He has impatiently partaken of some sardines and toast, and is even more impatiently disposing of a glass or two of Chablis.</i>
</p>
</div>
<p><i>Mr. Naggleton.</i> Now, can’t you say what you have to say?</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Have you finished lunch?</p>
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> I never take any, as you know. What on earth is this mystery?</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> You received my telegram?</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Why, of course I did, or I shouldn’t be here.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> O, I don’t know. I sent it entirely on speculation, as I had no idea where you might be.</p> <p><i>Mr. N.</i> Where should I be at twelve in the day but at business? Did you suppose I was on the top of the Monument, or in the middle of next week?</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> The message reached you, and that is enough. Now ring, please.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> What for?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> To have the things taken away. 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Let ‘em stop. Will you tell me why you have sent for me?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Do you wish the servant to come in, in the middle of our conversation?</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N. O, is it going to have a middle? Well, have your way.</i>
<p><i>[Rings, and the table is cleared, to the accompaniment, performed by Mr. Naggleton, of the tattoo popularly dedicated to the</i> Ècrasè <i>of</i> Lord Westbury.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N. (to the Servant.)</i> We are at home to nobody.</p> 
<p><i>[Exit Servant.</i></p>
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Who would call at such an hour?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> I cannot say. I have had one visitor already.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Now, Maria, you have not been absurd enough to call me away from business because some tax-gatherer has left a paper, or any nonsense of that kind? I was particularly engaged.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> I am sorry that you leave the house exposed to any such scandal, but that is not the business now.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> You <i>do</i> look serious, though. — None of the children — pooh — you’d have told me on the instant.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> I am glad that you do me some justice.</p>
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Bother — what’s the matter?</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Nothing. At least that is not the word.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Then I wish “sharp” was.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Do not begin with levity. This is not a time for it.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> You have something to tell me?</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> I have.</p> 
<p><i>[Fetches a icriting-case, and takes out a paper, evidently of a legal character.</i></p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Are yon going to make your will?</p> <p><i>Mrs. N. (with a serious smile.)</i> It is curious that you should have used that expression. <i>(Sits.)</i> Henry, the event which I expected has occurred.</p><p><i> Mr. N. (dazed).</i> But you expect so many events — some of them must occur occasionally.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> You have frequently — I may say habitually — taunted me with the remark that my family have estranged themselves from us.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N. I have never complained of it, at all events. I rather like it.</i> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> A wife understands many things, said by her husband, of which she feels it best to take no notice.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Agreed — especially when he hints at any little domestic reforms.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> You will regret introducing this tone into our conversation.</p>
<p><i>Mr. N. (growing angry.)</i> I may regret introducing another tone if you don’t make haste and tell me what you are driving at.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Read that?</p> 
<p><i>[Places the paper in his hands.</i> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> A lawyer’s handwriting ! Am I cited before Sir James Wilde? Eh! <i>(reads.)</i> I — I beg your pardon, Maria, I’m sure <i>(reads on)</i>. Then you were right in remaining in town.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Yes.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Well, she was a good old soul, in spite of her eccentricities. I always rather liked her, poor Henrietta Flaggerty, though she hated me.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Forbear to judge until you have read ihat extract from her will.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Remembered the children, has she? Good old thing!</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> She has remembered their parents.</p>
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Let us see.</p> 
<p><i>[Reads to the end of the paper, then lays it down, and gazes in a singular manner at his wife. She returns the gaze for some moments, and then begins to cry.</i> Mr. Naggleton <i>takes up the paper, and retires to a sequestered chair to re-peruse. He then comes back to his former seat.</i></p>
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Well, Maria?</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Well, Henry?</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> By Jove!</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N. (half smiling.)</i> How do you like it?</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N. (in a low voice.)</i> She was all right, I suppose?</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N. (with the woman’s quick apprehension where worldly advantage is concerned, and bless. ‘em for it.)</i> Oh, yes! as sane as you are.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N. (Goes to door and opens it suddenly; then closes it again.)</i> As I said before — well?</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> What made you do that?</p>
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Servants are curious.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Not such as mine, I trust. But never mind that, now. What do you say to Aunt Flaggerty’s will?</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> What am I to say?</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Nay, it is a case for your decision, Henry.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Do you mean that?</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Do I ever say anything that I don’t mean?</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> I hope so; I often do. But, seriously?</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N. (smiling.)</i> Seriously.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N. (snatching up paper.)</i> “Twenty thousand pounds, on two conditions, one of which shall be enforced by my executors, the other of which I must leave to the honour of Henry Naggleton and Maria, his wife.”</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Now, is not that conceived in the spirit of a lady?</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> She was a lady, and I am sorry to have to speak of her in the past tense. The first condition is—</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Read the second, first, dear.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> “That they entirely and for ever abandon their habit of scolding, snarling, and sneering, and study to converse politely, if not affectionately.” I thought we always did.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> O, you story. And, now the other condition.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> ” That they immediately discard the name of Naggleton, and assume, and for ever hereafter bear the name of — .” My dear Maria!</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N. (laughing.)</i> Read it out, Sir.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> “The name of Lovey-Dovey.”</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N. (slowly.)</i> Lovey-Dovey.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> My dear Henry, what a noise.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Noise! I should think so. My respected Maria, when a man is suddenly called upon to abandon a proud name which has been borne by three generations of members of the Coalscutters’ Company, and I do not know how many cavaliers, crusaders, and cannibals in the previous ages, it is time for him to make a noise.</p> <p><i>Mrs. N.</i> This means that the conditions are Accepted.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> They are frightfully hard, of course, but then consider the children. Twenty thousand pounds, added to the eleven and fourpence, or whatever other trifle I may have managed to put into the Post-office Savings’ Bank, is money.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> It is money, dear, and do not joke when we speak of the children’s welfare.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> I was never less inclined to joke in my life. Ha! ha! ha! ha!</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Hush, dear; you will really have the servants up if you go on like that.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Lovey-Dovey! I tell you what, we’ll travel on the Continent.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> I should like it of all things; but what for?</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> We should break ourselves gradually into the name. Monsieur et Madame L’Auvè D’Auvè would not be so bad.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Would that be honourable?</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> The name condition is not the one upon honour.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Ah! but would it be safe?</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> That’s another pair of breach — of breech-loaders.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Twenty thousand pounds! How much is that a-year, dear?</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Why, not exactly a fortune in Consols, but something that if we place it properly, will double itself as fast as a woman doubles a scandal.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Ah, there! You mustn’t talk like that, Henry, if we are to fulfil the terms.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> What? That’s a very liberal rendering of the will, Maria. Penal statutes are construed literally. There’s only one woman whom I am never to scold, and as I never did, the abstinence will be no privation. Come here.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Oh, you great goose. <i>(Coming, how ever.)</i> But there!</p> 
<p><i>[This line is inexplicable by the Editor.</i></p> <p><i>Mr. N.</i> It will be a severe trial to you, my poor Maria; but I must aid you with my masculine resolution and forbearance.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N. (boxes his ears).</i> As if you did not always begin. Well, then, that is settled, and you had better write to the executors telling them that we accept the legacy. How do people take new names?</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Anyhow. If you like, you can pay your Sovereign eighty-two pounds fifteen shillings for a Royal Licence, and if you prefer keeping the money, you can adopt your new name, and pay nothing at all.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> I suppose that it would be most respectable to have the Royal Licence.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Why don’t you go and ask the genteel Snotchley?</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Now, Henry, is that right?</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> No, it isn’t. I withdraw the Snotchley. But we haven’t begun the new regime yet. I think we may go on as before until the money is forked over.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> The sooner we begin the easier it will be.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> And we are both in very good tempers, so there is a platform for a good start. And so, my dear Mrs. Lovey-Dovey, I salute you by your new name. <i>[Salutes exchanged.</i></p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> And are you serious about travelling?</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Have you not often wished to see Rome?</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Ah, my wishes have been too often <i>(recovers herself)</i> granted by a kind husband for me to insist on anything he dislikes.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> But I don’t dislike it, and we’ll go, and look after that shawl which you thought proper to
sell <i>(recovers himself)</i>, and very properly too, for to tell the truth, I never much liked it, though I fancied you did.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Rome! That will be delightful. And long before we come back, all the talk about this affair will be over.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Yes, our dear five hundred friends will have swallowed their envy, hatred, and malice, and all uncharitableness.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Don’t make fun of such words, Henry, — though you do make me laugh, and you ought not, dear.</p>
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Quite right, though I mean nothing wrong.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> I am sure of that. Well, will you write the letter. And then, will you order some cards with the new name. It’s very absurd, but I shan’t feel that I have secured the legacy until I have sent cards to everybody I know.</p> 
<p><i>Mr. N.</i> We’ll put Twenty Thousand Pounds in a corner, and call the whole business Our Golden Wedding. May we live to keep a real one.</p> 
<p><i>Mrs. N.</i> Amen, with all my heart.</p> 
<p><i>[And so ends the History of the Naggletons, but you shall have one peep at the Lovey-Doveys.</i></p>

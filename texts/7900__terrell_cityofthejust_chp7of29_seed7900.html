<!-- Chapter 7 -->
<p>Before they got back to the village Mr. Winstaple had, as he called it, squared the rector. That worthy minister had become thoroughly convinced that it was his bounden duty, as a loving father, that he should strongly advocate the suit of the broker, and the more he thought of it the more clearly he saw the absurdly inadequate claims of Dr. Eccles to the hand of Winifred.</p>
<p>Some sort of instinct seemed to tell him that he would meet with opposition—perhaps from Winifred—perhaps from Bob—probably from both. But then opposition was that which, above all else, convinced the rector that he was right. He felt his back stiffen when he was opposed, and he felt encouraged by the conviction that those who opposed him must of necessity be in the wrong. A casual opinion became under such circumstances a cardinal axiom of faith, to doubt the accuracy of which bordered upon blasphemy.</p>
<p>Thus it happened that the very apprehension of opposition settled the matter more firmly in the rector’s mind; and when Mr. Winstaple said good-bye and promised to renew his visit shortly, so that he might commence in regular form his siege at the young lady’s heart, the broker felt assured that whatever happened he had a ready and willing supporter upon the scene; one, moreover, with the power and resolution to brook no attempt to set his authority at nought.</p>
<p>Business matters, and particularly the promotion of “The Silver Streak Gold Mining Company,” necessitated the presence of Mr. Winstaple in London, and however much he might have desired to remain, he was compelled to catch the mail.</p>
<p>He turned up at his office the next morning in excellent spirits. Cobham was waiting to see him. The prospectus was well forward; Lord Portskewet was chairman; then there was Colonel Sir Richard Beal, late of the Indian Army, a friend of Cobham’s, to represent the Army; and Mr. Josiah Simple, Q.C., M.P., a gentleman, who having failed in his profession, disgraced his silk gown by assisting in swindling the public for valuable consideration.</p>
<p>“We want a fourth,” said Cobham.</p>
<p>“I have him here,” answered Mr. Winstaple. “But we must create a shareholders’ committee of investigation. It seems that a parson cannot be a regular director, so we must get him in in that way. We can shove in some more names to make it look all right, just as we did in the Coal Vendors’ Company.” Then he wrote in “The Rev. Hugh Stepney, Rector of Pen-cwm-garw.”</p>
<p>“That is a new name,” remarked the promoter.</p>
<p>“All the better for that; besides, it rounds the thing off well. The peerage to lead, the Army, the Bar, and the Church. Ah—ah—ah; it’s very funny, isn’t it.”</p>
<p>“But it answers.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it works. The British public, cautious and chary, always bearing in mind that ‘fools rush in where angels fear to tread,’ will rush in here. I see them
scrambling for allotments like schoolboys for marbles. Big names, my boy—big and respectable ones—that’s all; and damn the scheme, if it were to convert melons into chariots and four—<em>à la,</em> Cinderella—the British public would swallow it, and plank down their golden sovereigns, eh, Cobham, old man. The man who discovered that little weakness deserved to be canonised by the City.”</p>
<p>Mr. Cobham did not like this boisterous mood in Mr. Winstaple. The broker had become frank—brutally frank—and Mr. Cobham was one of those who bore office as a churchwarden in Sydenham; who, when he stepped into the train every evening at London Bridge, left the cares and anxieties of the City behind, and became a respectable and respected member of the semi-detached aristocracy of Forest Hill. He felt bound to protest.</p>
<p>“You appear to doubt the soundness of the ‘Silver Streak,’ Winstaple; to doubt it, I say; and if I thought—”</p>
<p>“If you thought what?”</p>
<p>“Well, if I thought that—” then there was a gesture which was intended to fill up the rest of the sentence.</p>
<p>“I should just like to know, Cobham, what you do think; do you mean to tell me that you would subscribe to the ‘Silver Streak,’ yourself, for instance?”</p>
<p>“I have no money. If I had—” and there was another gesture, which might have meant “I would,” or “I would consider it,” or “ I would not.”</p>
<p>The broker, however, as I have said, was in a boisterous mood, and he did not intend to let Mr. Cobham with his religious scruples off.</p>
<p>“I suppose you are not such an ass as to believe that ‘The Silver Streak Gold Mining Company, Limited,’ will ever pay a dividend?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do. Do you think, Winstaple, that I, a man of position, and—I hope I am always modest—a man of religion and principles, would assist with my name in floating this scheme if I did not consider it a really good-—speculation.”</p>
<p>The broker roared with laughing. After a moment, during which Mr. Cobham looked indignantly astonished.</p>
<p>“Speculation! Jerusalem! what speculation: why you sanctimonious old idiot, you know as well as I do there isn’t an ounce of gold in the whole place,” and Mr. Winstaple gave way again to his sense of humour.</p>
<p>“But there might be,” responded Mr. Cobham, trying hard to keep up appearances with himself.</p>
<p>“Might be! there isn’t—isn’t—isn’t—isn’t,” shouted Mr. Winstaple, emphasising the repetition with his fist on the table.</p>
<p>“Winstaple,” answered the promoter, with an air of solemnity,“ you are joking. If I believed you, even for a moment, I would have nothing more to do with it. I should consider it very wrong—very wrong, indeed; as it is, of course I know you are joking; I know it very well, and if you were to swear you weren’t I shouldn’t believe you. Now, what about Johnson and Jackson? I ought to tell you I saw Johnson yesterday, and they are ready to make a market; they have arrangements with
half-a-dozen members of the House to keep the thing lively for at least a month; then by that time we must get a quotation.”</p>
<p>Winstaple was willing to allow his scrupulous co-operator to ride off on this side matter. There was nothing to be gained by pushing him too far, particularly as the man went straight enough, so long as he was not put in conflict with that extraordinary quality which he had substituted for his conscience.</p>
<p>“That’s all right. Now you had better see Moses of the <em>Financial Poster</em>, and get a line put in at once. Something to this effect: ‘Rumours are in the air that one of the most important—if not the most important—gold property will be offered to the public in the course of a few days; it is said amongst people Who ought to know that the vendor has sold at a mere song—not a year’s
yield, in fact. The shares are being eagerly dealt in at long premiums; there will be money made by the lucky ones who get allotments.’ Tell Moses I’m in the swim, and he won’t be forgotten, and then you can manage the smaller sharks easily enough.”</p>
<p>“Yes; I’ll draw up something fetching; then day by day we must follow it up until the list is opened. I forgot to tell you I have arranged for a meeting of the board to-morrow at my office; shall you be there? I got Softsoap to register the company yesterday; I saw no time was to be lost.”</p>
<p>“I will attend—at what time?”</p>
<p>“Two, sharp.”</p>
<p>“Right. But, Cobham, how do you reconcile all this with your—<em>religious scrupless</em> I think you called the things?” added the broker maliciously.</p>
<p>“I sincerely trust, Winstaple, that as the result of our labours the shareholders will be amply rewarded,” and with that he took up his umbrella, put on his well-polished hat, and departed.</p>
<p>Mr. Winstaple was too much surprised to laugh. “If I could only humbug myself like that, what a happy man I should be,” he mused, as he heard the promoter’s steady steps on the stairs.</p>
<p>The meeting of the board came off the following day, as arranged. Mr. Winstaple had not thought it desirable to summon the rector from Wales; there were many reasons, amongst them that it was best the board
should be in working order before he put in an appearance. Then the rector was necessary where he was, with
one eye on Winifred and the other, no doubt, on Dr. Eccles, and it would be very unwise to withdraw him from that important occupation.</p>
<p>Lord Portskewet sat at the head of the table, with Sir Richard Beal to his right and Mr. Josiah Simple to his left; at the bottom was Mr. Shepston-Jones—with a hyphen. Mr. Shepston-Jones was a son-in-law of Mr.
Cobham, and his name appeared upon the prospectus of all the companies promoted by that gentleman as “secretary pro tem.”</p>
<p>The “secretary pro term.” was well up in his duties. He had his usual books before him to be called for if required by “my board,” and he had a memorandum book in which he made entries of proceedings at board meetings, altered them when necessary or expedient, copied them into his agenda book, and then submitted them for signature, which, with such a business-like board as this, was done as a matter of course.</p>
<p>“The first thing will be for the secretary to read the minutes of the last meeting,” remarked the chairman.</p>
<p>“I beg pardon, my lord,” remarked Mr. Shepston-Jones, “this is the first meeting of the directors of The
Silver Streak Gold Mining Company, Limited.”</p>
<p>“Ah—yes, of course, how absent of me. It is two o’clock; I am due at the meeting of Benson Flats, Limited, at three, and I made a mistake; this is our first meeting as directors of a company, which I have no
doubt will, under our fathering care, be a very successful company. I look upon my companies as I would upon
my children. I have not been blessed with children in the proper sense; with me the ancient earldom of Portskewet becomes extinct. It is a sad recollection, but I trust—I very sincerely trust that the name and title I bear will be remembered in the future as that of the pioneer of many successful—very successful commercial enterprises. Do you know, Beal, I sometimes hope that these companies over which I preside will be called Portskewet companies, and so the old title would not die out after all, what do you think?” and the noble lord refreshed himself with a pinch of snuff.</p>
<p>“Perhaps, my lord, the board would like the assistance of Mr. Cobham and Mr. Winstaple to inform you as to
how matters are progressing,” interrupted Mr. Shepston-Jones, who was aware of the weak points in his lordship’s character, and thought it as well to get to business.</p>
<p>“Quite right, Jones ; send for Cobham.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the promoter and the broker took their seats at the board; there were friendly nods round, and after a few preliminary remarks Mr. Winstaple began-—</p>
<p>“Proposed by the chairman, and seconded by Sir Richard Beal, that the prospectus of the company, a copy of which was read and is hereto annexed, be issued. That is carried, I presume. Have you got it down ? ” he inquired of the secretary.</p>
<p>“Stay,” said the colonel, “I ought to see the prospectus.”</p>
<p>“A mere matter of form, my dear sir,” answered the Queen’s counsel.</p>
<p>“Oh ! very well ; if you say so, of course. I apologise, go on.”</p>
<p>“Proposed by Sir Richard Beal, and seconded by Mr. Josiah Simple, that the abridged prospectus be inserted
in the ordinary newspapers,” continued Mr. Winstaple, dictating to the secretary.</p>
<p>“Wait,” interrupted Mr. Cobham, “had we not better get a resolution to go to the public put in first?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course ; I had forgotten that,” replied Winstaple.</p>
<p>So all the resolutions were duly proposed, and seconded, and carried; and if any judge should hereafter make inquiries as to the proceedings at this board meeting he would find everything duly recorded in the agenda book, scrupulously kept by the secretary pro tem.; and he would further find that the chairman and board were duly paid their fees for the important labours they had undergone on behalf of their brother shareholders.</p>
<p>“Is that all?” inquired Lord Portskewet, with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“I will get these out for signature. We should have another meeting on Friday,” answered Mr. Shepston-Jones.</p>
<p>“Same time, I suppose?” asked the colonel, who having tasted blood in the shape of directors’ fees was
eager to follow the scent.</p>
<p>“I would prefer it a little earlier,” remarked the peer; he was an old and well-established guinea pig, with many appointments on his note-book.</p>
<p>The time was arranged and the board dispersed.</p>
<p>Mr. Cobham was left with Mr. Winstaple.</p>
<p>“That was a nice little note in the <em>Poster</em>—a very nice little note,” said the latter.</p>
<p>“You think I can do my work well sometimes, then?”</p>
<p>“My dear Cobham, you do not, I hope, delude yourself with the idea that I do business with you because you are beautiful, or wealthy, or influential, or a hundred other things.”</p>
<p>“What is it, then, to which I owe the felicity of your patronage?” asked the promoter in more testy tones than he was in the habit of using.</p>
<p>“If you must know, it is to your delightful hypocritical cheek.”</p>
<p>“Really, Winstaple, I do not understand you of late you have been—well, to say the least of it—rude, positively rude to me; I am hurt, I tell you plainly I am very much hurt, after so many years—”</p>
<p>“Don’t say any more about it, old man; but <em>that</em> note, you cannot be surprised. I was completely knocked off my perch—as the parrot said—after your pious remarks of yesterday. That note! oh, lord!” and Mr. Winstaple could not resist the temptation of a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>Mr. Cobham was secretly pleased; his vanity was flattered, for it was evident the broker was delighted with
the paragraph he had written and got inserted ; and however much Mr. Cobham might, from time to time, be
offended with Mr. Winstaple, he was sufficiently impressed with the astuteness and business capacity of
that gentleman to be overjoyed when he clapped his hands in approval.</p>
<p>There was a good deal of trouble to be gone through yet with “The Silver Streak Gold Mining Company.” The
directors were obtained, and the prospectus was sketched out and ready, with all the other necessary names, true; but that is not all that is needed to float successfully a public company—that is in the way in which the British public require that a company should be floated.</p>
<p>Some of the underwriting had yet to be done, and then, although the <em>financial Poster</em> and its pesiding deity, Moses, had been arranged with, and was now going strong in favour of the new enterprise ; there was a whole shoal of other papers of equal honesty but of not so large influence and circulation to be propitiated. Underwriting shares is a peculiar operation, and it is one which, taking it altogether, is not unprofitable to the underwriters; but a person desirous of underwriting looks at the prospects of the public coming in and subscribing to the shares more—far more—than at the <em>bona fides</em> or chances of the
company when floated. Now, the process of floating public companies, and the persons who really float them,
but whose names are carefully kept in the background, (such as Mr. Cobham and Mr. Winstaple) are well-known
to certain other persons, who are proprietors, or editors, or advertisement canvassers of financial newspapers; and these persons make a living, and often enough a fortune, by black-mailing the promoters. They are in the position of the man who knows his friend is cheating at cards and who insists on going halves in the profits. If the promoter refuses, his name and that of all his co-operators appear in the next morning’s issue, together
with recollections of his previous doings in the City of the Just and of the financial results of the companies
with which the particular gang has been previously connected.</p>
<p>This is fatal, because it gives the cue to other papers who are honest, and they give the cue to the public; the public stand aloof, the underwriters find themselves, as they call it, landed, and the scheme is at an end. So it happens, that whilst promoters try to keep themselves in the background, the financial newspaper ferret, strain every nerve to discover them, and the underwriters look on so as to know whether or not they have been successfully propitiated before they agree to underwrite.</p>
<p>To unravel and lay bare the whole fraud would take a volume, so infinite are the kaleidoscopic arrangements
which are devised by the promoter to swindle a confiding public, and the corresponding devices of the leaches to fasten upon him and suck some of his blood. Suffice it to say, that “The Silver Streak” promotion possessed all the usual intricacies of commission notes, bribes, underwriting contracts, fees to all manner of people, followed up by a crowd of more or less vague promises of all sorts; and these increased as time went on. Every day brought a new batch of demands, which it was necessary to deal with; so it was urgent that the matter should be got out of hand at once.</p>
<p>Mr. Cobham and Mr. Winstaple spent an anxious hour or two making their final arrangements. So much
depended upon the final coup. If they succeeded in striking the public taste all would be well; if not, neither
of these respected members of City society could contemplate the result with equanimity. The City judges by
results, and measures this result only by the standard of the pound sterling. A man gambles headlong with other
people’s money—fraudulently, recklessly, wickedly, as you will—he succeeds, and he is held up to respect and dies in the Aldermanic chair; he fails, and human ingenuity has not discovered language adequate to the occasion; and yet the line between failure or success is an exceedingly fine one; the weight that turns the balance may be but a single hair.</p>

<p>When he got back to the privacy of his own sanctum Mr. Winstaple sat down and wrote a long letter to the
rector. The company would be brought out now in a few days; there would surely be a rush; he would do his
very best to secure to the rector the promised thirty thousand shares; he would strongly advise him to sell
out two-thirds the moment there was a substantial profit; he might stick to the rest. There had been a board
meeting for the formal matters, which he had not considered it worth while to drag him up to town for; his
name would appear on the prospectus, and he might well be proud of the position he would occupy. Then he came
closer home. He hoped to be able to run down early next week, when he would try and remain a few days,
and he trusted the rector would allow him to pay his <em>devoirs</em> (he had got the word from a French novel) to Winifred. He had spoken to a friend of his who was much in the confidence of the Bishop of London, and
had not forgotten the rector; he had no doubt but that he would be easily able to influence the Bishop, and if
not, a good West-end living could readily be purchased. He felt the necessity of not losing time in this direction. The golden years of one’s life are not to be picked up again. Then there was some hint about Eccles being looked after, not that he feared him as a rival in the least, still it was unnecessary to court complications; and the letter finished up with “Yours ever to command, Effingham Winstaple.”</p>

<!-- Chapter 23 of the third volume, but chapter 47 overall -->
<!--CHAPTER XXIII.-->

<p> Nearly two years have elapsed since the escape of
Blanche and Nadeshta from the power of the Prince.</p>

<p>Already all his estates have been sold excepting those in the government of Kalouga, for he has preferred selling his slaves and property outright to pledging them to the crown, fully aware that in that case they are equally lost, being, from one cause or other, scarcely ever redeemed.</p>

<p>By a trait which would appear strange and anomalous in other nations, but which is characteristic enough of the higher order of Russians, the Prince Isaakoff urged by an irresistible impulse — with a cool head and with his eyes open — has plunged into a course
of boundless and ruinous extravagance. Profuse without generosity, and magnificent without dignity, lavishing millions whilst still mean in trifles; he clearly foresaw and yet by a strange fascination could not shun this reckless dissipation of his once colossal    fortune. Like those gamesters, who, aware of all the chances in favour of the tables, of the advantages of its superior capital, and without any illusive confidence in their own luck, are still fascinated to play without a hope of eventual success.</p>

<p>Now, although the estate of the Bialoe-Darevnia which he still possessed was unmortgaged, his necessities had caused him long since to neglect all prudence in extracting from it all that could momentarily be squeezed out of his peasantry to supply the exigencies of the moment; and as a most fitting instrument for this purppose he still retained Johann Sauer in his employment. As the misanthropic old Starost had prophesied from his keen observation alike of men and of the rotation of the seasons, the harvest failed, just when everything was shaven closely from the surface of the land, reducing the estate to the condition of one or two which happened to adjoin it.</p>

<p>Some hundred thousand slaves, amongst them the ten thousand of the Bialoe Darevnia, were famine-stricken : the other owners had already mortgaged them, and like Isaakoff (who still resolutely refused to do so,) were unwilling or unable to raise any immediate fund for their relief. The winter passed, but with the spring disease and hunger began to decimate and render desperate this unhappy population.</p>

<p>A wretched crowd battled eagerly for the garbage thrown out from the dwelling of the sleek Johann Sauer, notwithstanding all the dread which his now unbridled rapacity and severity inspired. His comfortable stacks of corn rose round the farm-yard, his cattle lowed, his poultry cackled within it; he was rich and well to do in the world, and he had established on the estate itself, a manufactory for the fabrication of beet-root sugar.</p>

<p>Bob Bridle, left behind by Count Horace, had sought out the Prince, a step which will be at once accounted for by the fact that the grey horse Lucifer had been tacitly confiscated by the latter, and, as he was found utterly unmanageable, the services of Bob had been eagerly secured: he had trained him, and ridden him, and won with him at Moscow, and he was now settled with him for the winter in the village of Bialoe-Darevnia.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the affection which had grown up betwixt the fiery stallion and his groom. The loose box which Lucifer inhabited formed an anteroom to Bob’s own apartment. The walls were whitewashed, and it was neatly paved, cleanly swept, and kept warm by the same stove as Bob’s own chamber, indeed, it only differed from it in being boarded, furnished with a bed and chest of drawers,
and ornamented with a print of the last winner of the Derby before Bob had quitted the turf, mounted by the jockey who had ridden him — a work of art which,from the care he took of it, the Russians mistook for the image of his patron saint.</p>

<p>When a distinction is made between the apartments of Bob and his horse, it must be explained that it existed more in form than in reality; for, long before daylight in the winter, Lucifer used to make his way into the groom’s bed-chamber, sometimes playfully lifting the bed-clothes with his teeth, and sometimes touching his cheek with his black muzzle till he had awakened him; and then on the other hand Bob spent a large portion of his leisure in the horse’s stall, seated on a barrel placed next the stove to keep the water thawed, and which he had painted pea-green, tastily picking out the hoops with white. Here he either polished the bits, or stirrup irons, or perused his bible, or peered with avidity into the racing calendar, of which he had added a few volumes to his   library.</p>

<p>The upper half of the stable door, on which Lucifer’s racing plates had been nailed, was open; he had been properly attended to, and, this operation performed, Bob had prepared his own breakfast consisting of tea and toast. Using the green cask as a table, he had
spread on it a snow-white napkin and drawn a chair beside it. The grey horse’s head intruded inquiringly over his shoulder as the groom raised to his mouth the tea, which he had poured out into a saucer.</p>

<p>“Now then!” said Bob, “now then, Lucy ! do let other folks have their breakfast, you’ve had yourn. I’ll put that ere head into a bag if you don’t take it away; don’t you see that the sugar basin is covered, and you can’t get it into the milkpot, though I’m agreeable to admit that it <i>is</i> a small head, and as well set on as a horse’s need be.”</p>

<p>Lucifer, thus spoken to, whinnied an answer, rubbing his muzzle gently against Bob’s cheek, and then smelling the plate of toast.</p>

<p>“Now then! do you want to put your nose too near the Sammy what’s-o-name,” continued Bob, alluding to the <i>Samovar</i>, or tea-urn, “and spill the tea over my leathers as you did yesterday? No, don’t meddle with that plate, I never beared of a horse being cocked up with such dainties as buttered toast ‘specially when he gets the best of oats, beans, and, carrots, and so many poor creatures of Christians, which they calls theirselves, is glad to pick the leavins off the dunghill. Come, let me have my  breakfast, you always gets your feed, full measured and carefully sifted, and I havn’t had a mornin’s belly-full these three weeks.”</p>

<p>And it was true that, every morning, the hungry children who looked in wistfully had excited such pity in Bob’s breast that he divided the best part of his breakfast between them, always protesting that “he wished the young shavers would go and stare Johann out of his appetite instead of him,” and inquiring whether they thought he was to feed the whole village and have his own breakfast out of that ere plate of toast?</p>

<p>“It’s a blessin,” continued Bob, looking at Lucifer to whom the best part of his conversation was generally addressed, “it’s a blessin’ that they havn’t thought of me this morning, though,” he added after a moment’s reflection, “poor things, perhaps some on ‘em is laid by the heels with hunger,” and so saying he compassionately laid aside on a shelf all the remainder of his loaf.</p>

<p>Now the reason why no one had come that morning to Bob Bridle’s door was, that it was a day of terror in the village. During the night a daring band of desperadoes, ravenous with hunger, not contented, as Johann said, with the refuse of the beet-root (after the sugar had been extracted from it) which he regularly distributed amongst them, had actually dug into the deep pit in which the roots were stored to keep them from the frost. When the tardy daylight dawned, Johann discovered the ground not only strewed with the remains of roots on which the famished wretches had assuaged their appetite, but many tons deposited in the same place frost-bitten and destroyed.</p>

<p>His rage knew no bounds. As for his wife, she even allowed this event to derange the immutable course of her household economy. The making up the ley for the great wash was postponed, and the bleeding of the pigs was deferred, for this thrifty manager, of whom Bob observed, “that she would squeeze milk out of a flint, and pick the kernel out of a paving-stone” — had accustomed these hapless animals to the operation every ten days for a month or two preceding their being converted into pork; thus drawing the blood regularly as a cow is milked to make black puddings, a proceeding which had the further advantage of rendering the swine dropsical, in which condition they were slaughtered, frozen, and sent to market, where they sold by weight.</p>

<p>All the efforts of Johann to discover the guilty parties failed. There was no indication by which to trace them, excepting a single distinct footprint on the snow, but this footprint was of very ordinary dimensions, so that more than eighty adult males were discovered in the manor village of whose tread it might alike have been the impress.</p>

<p>“You will keep them apart,” said Johann to the Starost, “for to-morrow I expect both my brother Dietrich and the Captain Ispravnick. You are right, you are always right, Batushka (father), I am too lenient with them. An example must be made, or we shall have them in open rebellion.”</p>

<p>The old Starost grinned savagely, as he always did at the prospect of any additional severity.</p>

<p>“Oh, your blagarodie’s brother comes to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Johann, “we have nothing to feed these rogues with yet, and when we have — if we procure anything — they shall have nothing in this village till the refuse of the beetroot is eaten. Now
Dietrich will take off our hands by contract a hundred and eighty, and I am sure all the sick and decrepid will never recover in such an unfavourable season. So better let him take them at thirty roubles a-piece, or even at half for his manufactory, than let them die upon our hands like sheep of the rot. Only you must bear in mind two things—firstly that you must bring out all the sickliest    portion for him to select from, for we shall find him dainty, seeing that he can choose in the villages round; and secondly, that we let them here believe that it is done to punish that barefaced robbery. They don’t like going to the manufactory, do they even now, the fools?</p>

<p>“They don’t like going to the manufactory,” replied the Starost.</p>

<p>“I should like to go anywhere if I was fed when starving,” said Johann.</p>

<p>“Your blagarodie is wise,” answered the Starost; “those foolish creatures say, those who sell us for twenty-five roubles know that there is not much more than twenty-five roubles’ worth of work in us; and those who buy us, when once they have filled our bellies with food, will not wait to get their money slowly out of us: it will pay them best to work us to death, and buy another set. But then what is that to the Oupravitel? He has only to consider whether it is advantageous for the estate.”</p>

<p>Such is unhappily the system on which many of the manufactories in the empire are supplied with labour. Where the average price of the sound slave is £12 or £15 or £20, sets of labourers — the sick, the consumptive, the decrepid — are leased out for an indefinite period, or actually sold as artisans, for premiums varying from twenty to fifty shillings. The condition of these human hells furnishes a terrible answer to those, who cite the horrors of our own
workhouses and factories to palliate the condition of the Russian serf.</p>

<p>A few hours after these cruel orders had been given to the old Starost, Hans, Dietrich’s son, arrived alone. Hans had been established in Moscow as a dealer in <i>comestibles</i>, an occupation more congenial to his taste than any other upon earth, had it not been, as he said, for the sad drawback of daily parting with so many dainties to his customers. He was little changed, excepting that his cheeks were more rubicund and plump, and that a premature abdominal rotundity showed that he was still as much as ever given to gastronomic indulgence.</p>

<p>“How is this, Hans ?” said the father. “Where is thy uncle Dietrich?”</p>

<p>“He <i>would</i> remain upon the road,” replied Hans. “He is on the next estate with the Captain Ispravnik:—they will both be here to breakfast to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Dolt, lout, and idiot,” said Johann, “I wrote for thee to come with him purposely, that he should not tarry and find out that there are other estates exactly in the condition of our own. I have no partnership with thy uncle Dietrich now; and he would have driven a bargain hard enough, without knowing that he had all the country round about to pick from. At least, thou shouldst not have left
him.”</p>

<p>“I would not,” replied Hans, “if I had not known that this was the day on which mother sends off the black puddings.”</p>

<!-- CHAPTER XIX. -->

<p>When Carstairs had left Green’s sick room he had told himself that he should return soon, but it was high summer before his steps were once more bent that way. The May freshness had given place to July dust and heat ; the season was on the wane ; the gay crowd which had thronged the Park upon the occasion of his first visit was already dispersing to loch, mountain, and moor ; in another week August would release the larger world of toilers, and every little seaside nook welcome its throng of holiday-makers. Carstairs envied neither the rich who could go where they would nor the less who went where they could ; for him there was to be no setting forth in search of new scenes ; he was in that dangerously acquiescent mood—unnatural toyouth and health—which only asks that one shall be let alone. To resist being urged out of town was the one thing that had the force of a motive.</p>

<p>” You will go and see your mother ? ” Elizabeth had asked him earlier in the year, and he had answered that he supposed she would expect it. But after writing peevishly once or twice of her loneliness the widow had suddenly announced a retreat to the villa, ” down the water,” of a rich patron, and Jim, having, out of his slender savings, contributed a black silk dress to his mother’s holiday wardrobe, felt himself released.</p>

<p>He had that morning finished a task which had occupied him fitfully ever since the day of his arrival in London. The MS. of his first novel lay complete to the last word upon his desk.</p>

<p>A great deal of pleasure and a great deal of pain had gone into those careful pages ; the early hopefulness which had at first sustained him had failed him latterly, and it was with conscious compulsion lie had mastered his apathy and kept his grip upon the closing scenes ; but the strain had left him without energy for further effort, and he knew that days or weeks might elapse before he could conquer his reluctance to send his venture forth to its chance of success or failure.</p>

<p>With a wisdom which does not always inspire the beginner, he had laid his story among the familiar scenes of boyhood, resisting the temptations which London presented to his imagination—London the terrible, with its passion, joy, trouble, its awful wealth, its awful poverty, of which he knew but the outer signs as yet. But upon the shores of Fife his tread was sure ; he knew its life, its manners, its habit of thought to the core ; there was not a sign he could misread or misinterpret, and he had written with that perfect confidence in his control of his subject which has its compulsion over the most careless reader.</p>

<p>But does the fiction-loving world, so easily content to
accept imitation for reality, trouble itself to recognize or
applaud the power to project forcibly, to flash the light on familiar things, to make make men and women move with self-evident reality across the imaginary stage ?</p>

<p>That Carstairs should doubt it, should even be willing, with dull apathy to accept its verdict, let it be what it might, shows how far he had fallen from his early confidence, his early triumph in his own untasted success. The iron grip of circumstance was slowly crushing the life out of him. He saw the props upon which he had proposed to climb one by one slipping from under him. <i>The Philosopher’s</i> busy, brilliant life was ended. Bridle was silent; editors and publishers showed no eagerness to enroll him among their contributors; slowly the unpalatable truth was forcing itself upon him that even the most painstaking, the most brilliant work finds no ready market until the fickle public has stamped the writer with its approval.</p>

<p>” But that once gained,” he said to himself, with a sneer that scarce troubled itself to be bitter, ” you may cease either from painstaking or brilliance—you may write as fool for other fools.”</p>

<p>” I’ll tell you what,” said Murray, who sat by Green’s sofa the day when Carstairs set out to pay his second visit to North Kensington, ” somebody will have to interfere or he will come to grief. He’s been wiring in till he’s used himself up; but it’s no good my preaching; I only raise his corruption. Perhaps hint from you—-“</p>

<p>“I’m an eloquent enough warning, certainly,” said Green, with a smile; “but he hasn’t come near me. I wish he had.” He paused to look up at the opening of the door, and Carstairs stood upon the threshold.</p>

<p>” Speak of the—- No, don’t look so glum,” said Murray with mocking gayety. ” I can muster enough German to be polite. Speak of the fox and his tail appears.”</p>

<p>” So that’s your notion of civility, is it ? ” said Carstairs, looking not too well pleased to see Murray in possession of the chair by the invalid’s side. ” Green, I’m sorry to find you still upon your back.”</p>

<p>” It’s not worth a regret,” said Green, with his genial smile. “I found ‘greening,’ as you say in the North (no pun intended), a profitless business long ago. I’ve taken up my position as a spectator of life, and the part has its humors, I can tell you ! “</p>

<p>Carstairs turned his head aside. He thought of the poet-dreamer whose spirit remained unconquered on his mattress grave, whose lambent humor lit even the dark ways of death, and he felt subdued before this other sufferer’s dear-bought patience.</p>

<p>His own smallness stung him. He would have liked to take Green’s wasted hand in his and say :</p>

<p>” You have learned your lesson ; teach me the secret of your fortitude.”</p>

<p>But how say this before Murray—Murray who always acted on his impulses like a shower-bath ? He drew himself a chair to the other side of the sofa and sat down silent.</p>

<p>” We were talking of you when you came in,” said Green in that gentle way that gave no offense. ” Murray tells me you have been overworking.”</p>

<p>Carstairs’ laugh was ungracious.</p>

<p>” I should have fancied his opportunities of observation were rather limited. How often have we met within the last two months ? “</p>

<p>” Now, then, don’t cut up rough ! ” Murray laughed good-naturedly. ” If we haven’t foregathered oftener your exclusiveness is at fault. I’ve seen you often enough to know that you look seedy ; you’re growing thin, though you never had much flesh to spare. I am morally certain, though I can’t prove it, since Miss Niel never invites me to dinner, that you don’t eat enough, and have the best sort of assurance, since you happen to live over my head, that you’ve fallen off your sleep. You’ve all the symptoms of a breakdown, and my advice to you is—wipe your pen and scuttle out of London as fast as you can.”</p>

<p>“My good Murray,” said Carstairs impatiently, “you mean  excellently, but you talk a lot of nonsense. You happen to be addressing the idlest man in London just now.”</p>

<p>” That’s right,” said Green pleasantly. ” All work and no play brings Tom, Dick, and Harry to a sick bed in a garret. I hope the idleness includes the reading of other people’s novels, though in truth <i>that’s</i> hard enough work sometimes ! But here’s something that asks to be read. Have you seen it ? ” He handed a substantial volume in red binding to his guest.</p>

<p>” I didn’t know it had gone into a second edition.” Carstairs looked at the fly-leaf. “I’ve read the reviews in the <i>Athenœum</i> and the <i>Saturday.</i>”</p>

<p>” I haven’t. Polly doesn’t allow it.” Green laughed softly. ” She says it biases my judgment to read other people’s opinions before I’ve formed my own.”</p>

<p>” You are noticing it ? “</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>” What is it ? ” said ‘Murray, picking up the book as Carstairs
laid it down. Oh, ‘Pastures New.’ A novel of clergy and spinsterdom, isn’t it ? They say Blank was seen reading it in the House of Commons, and the first edition went off like wildfire. I wish the illustrious old gentleman would give <i>me</i> a free advertisement ! “</p>

<p>” Envy and all uncharitableness say a good many things that aren’t true, and everybody always hears of the thing which has not happened. The book is a good book of its kind, the sort of book a young fellow need never be ashamed of starting with, to whatever heights he may rise in after days.”</p>

<p>” I dare say he has his bank account to thank for that,” said Murray. ” If it is true that he’s old Carrington’s son it’s no such credit to him to be leisurely and moral and proper. It’s only we poor devils who have no choice between starving and dancing to other people’s piping.”</p>

<p>” Since you admit there’s a choice, I suppose heroism would prefer starvation,” said Green lightly—” if it were only a question of self,” he added under his breath.</p>

<p>Carstairs said nothing. He had felt the bitter compulsion of poverty in the year that had gone over his head. He who had despised the sick man at his side had been tempted too, and had yielded to a force stronger than himself. He had been silent where he should have spoken ; he had left unsaid that which his whole soul burned to say. But in his book he had recovered his freedom. That at least, poor thing as it might be, was his own. He would have liked to tell Green about it, but he could not in Murray’s presence.</p>

<p>” And the moral of it all,” Green was saying, “is, don’t marry. It’s a luxury no literary man who depends on his pen can afford, unless he’s prepared to sacrifice scruple to expediency.”</p>

<p>” That’s a hard saying,” said Murray, looking rather conscious.</p>

<p>” You’re disposed to dispute ?” Green spoke in the same quiet, amused voice.</p>

<p>” I’m inclined,” said Murray, laughing, but reddening too, “to take Miss Polly’s opinion on the point. I’ve great respect for Miss Polly’s opinion, and she has had better opportunities of observation than most of us. She has been behind the scenes—as spectator.”</p>

<p>” You may certainly rely on her candor,” said Green, his luminous eyes bright with laughter. ” If it’s important to you to secure her advice at once I think I can undertake to promise that you’ll meet her you take the first turning to the left when you leave this door, and keep a sharp eye on the butcher and baker and candlestick maker. It’s the part of wisdom, Polly tells me, to do your shopping in the afternoon; and I’ve no doubt she’s at this moment engaged in circumventing the green grocer or the fishmonger.</p>

<p>Murray received the hint with favor. He remarked that it might be as well to leave before he was turned out, which would certainly be his fate if Miss Polly came home and found two visitors in possession of the sick room; that Carstairs ought to be grateful to him for being the one to sacrifice himself.</p>

<p>” And that,” said Green, turning to Carstairs with a whimsical look when Murray had airily talked himself out of the room, “is all that comes of setting oneself up as a kind of moral fingerpost. When you are as old as am, Carstairs, you will find out that Example is a humbug, no better than his twin brother Precept, whom he affects to despise. Come, now that the trifler out of the way, tell me about yourself. Is it true that you are holiday-making ?”</p>

<p>Since last night,” said Carstairs, drawn on easily to give his confidence, ” when wrote <i>finis</i> to my first venture.”</p>

<p>“I congratulate you very sincerely. I am not too old to remember the rush of joy and pride and pleasure that comes with the completion of one’s first honest bit of work.”</p>

<p>“Honest?” Carstairs hesitated. “I think it’s that—at least I’ve had no fear of publishing man before my eyes while I wrote it; but I seem to have missed the pleasure.”</p>

<p>” That will come with its acceptance. I think you may have confidence in your success.”</p>

<p>” It depends on how you define success. If it means the chance condescension of a cabinet minister—-“</p>

<p>” Ah ! ” said Green, ” but, my dear fellow, we soon cease
to look our gift horse in the mouth. We don’t ask success what road it travels by ; we only ask that it shall arrive.”</p>

<p>” I suppose I shall come to that,” said Carstairs, smiling ruefully ; ” but you’ll admit that the public does a good deal to belittle the favors it bestows. Why, even this fellow “—he laid his hand on the book they had been discussing — ” must find his triumph tarnished since he is forced to share it with the author of ‘ Poppy Petals,’ that bundle of sham misanthropy and sham pathos ! “</p>

<p>” He certainly owes none of his popularity to the critics,” said Green, laughing; “there was nothing faint in their damnation.”</p>

<p>” And yet the public has swallowed three editions and asks for more ! “</p>

<p>” What will you ? said Green, with a little shrug of the thin shoulders. ” It’s a misguided child, and prefers to follow its own judgment rather than to be led. It’s for you, who are young and strong, to teach it better. But you will have the critics on your side. Your Cambridge honors should at least secure you their respectful attention.”</p>

<p>” Cambridge ! ” cried Carstairs with a fine disdain. “What has it done for me ? Given me the incomplete mas tery of two dead languages. Bohn has done as much for Murray without the grind.”</p>

<p>Green looked thoughtfully at the moody young face, his own alight with compassionate sympathy. He understood it all, the revolt and rebellion, the disgust with the life that falls so far short of its ideal ; and though, perhaps, in his case disenchantment had come less swiftly, it was but the more bitter that it followed on a brilliant outset.</p>

<p>It had long been too late to retrieve his own broken fortunes, and he had resigned himself to his lot with a gentle philosophic humor that was not without its pathos; but if there was yet time to save this younger brother of the pen from following in his steps, it seemed to the sick man, in the large unselfishness that trouble had wakened in him, that the effort was worth making.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the pause in their talk had given Carstairs leisure to be ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>“You think me an ill-conditioned grumbler,” he said, “and so I seem to myself when I look at you ; or perhaps you will say an arrogant ass.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut ! ” said Green in pleasant repudiation ; “I think poorly of the chances of any young fellow who doesn’t at least aspire to a place on the muster roll of the immortal. As for your growl, it’s a privilege we all allow ourselves whether we succeed or fail ; and, indeed, there’s no such arch malcontent as your prosperous writer. But have patience ; you are one, if I know anything, for whom the gods have a sneaking kindness. Success will come to you if you can wait for it. Things might easily have been worse.”</p>

<p>” I fail to see how that could be.”</p>

<p>” You might have elected to be a poet, for instance. Now it’s long been my conviction that no man in his senses ought to start in that line unless he has a comfortable competence to fall back upon. The prose writer gets a hearing in course of time if he is persistent enough ; but in this hurrying, go-ahead age we can’t wait to be interpreted in verse—a big show poet or two satisfies our turn.”</p>

<p>” If it were only waiting,” said Carstairs ; ” but meanwhile, unfortunately, one has a stomach which demands to be filled.”</p>

<p>” I’ve always maintained,” said Green, ” that there ought to
be a national fund to provide for the wants of young talent—a nursery of literature, in short, where the promising aspirant should be kept in bread and butter and shirts and coats till he can repay his debt to the public in pleasure and instruction. There might be a mistake made now and again, but we should save our Chattertons from suicide. Some old fellow, with no heir to his millions, might bequeath them to worse purpose. But since we are left to shift for ourselves, the question is, as you say, how to keep body and soul together till the world discovers our merit. I solved by marrying”—he smiled—” and doubling my cares as well as my pleasures. You must take a better way than that.”</p>

<p>” Show me, and if you advise I’ll take it.”</p>

<p>” My dear lad, I’m but a broken reed to lean on, but you give me courage to say a word it has been in my mind to speak ever since you came in.”</p>

<p>” Say it, and give me a chance to show I’m in earnest.”</p>

<p>” You spoke slightingly just now of your college career—-“</p>

<p>“I have no pleasant recollections connected with it”—he spoke in bitterness. ” It may be a happy experience for the well-to-do; it is no place for the poor and struggling.”</p>

<p>” That’s all over,” said Green kindly, ” and your B. A. will stand you in good stead yet; even if you think it won’t help you with the publishers—and I’m not so sure of that—it may serve your turn in other ways. Here, for instance ” —-he put his hand on a letter which lay open on the table at his side—” is a man who would engage you on the strength of it, backed by my poor recommendation, you were willing to fall in with his wishes.”</p>

<p>Carstairs flushed. “Poverty can’t afford to be squeamish,” he said with an effort at ease. “But even if your friend were willing to give me trial, he may easily enough want more of me than I can give.”</p>

<p>” That I scarcely think. The writer of this, Dr. Robson, is a man I knew at one time pretty well, as well as one man who has his livelihood to make can know another in London. Chance threw us good deal together, and though he was older than I, and we had few tastes in common, we came to be what I suppose you would call friends. He was then a busy practitioner, widower with one child, and I should have said an ambitious man, eager to rise in his profession, and sticking at nothing that would help him; but we may easily misjudge another. I dare say I had no business to be surprised when, some fifteen years ago, Robson married again, and, throwing up all his prospects here, settled down to feel rustic pulses in a quiet village, far from the madding crowd, where his hopes of distinction must certainly be extinguished. The lady, who was widow, I believe, no doubt was worthy the sacrifice, if it was one. Since then I have heard from him at long intervals, but we have never met. The only child of this marriage, a son, inherits his mother’s delicacy, it seems, and the letter concerns itself with his education. But you will see for yourself what he suggests.”</p>

<p>Carstairs took the letter and read it carefully.</p>

<p>” He doesn’t seem very exacting,” he said; “a backward boy of twelve ought not to be very difficult to coach.”</p>

<p>” Yet he lays some stress, you see, on a college-bred instructor. He puts the higher value on university honors, since he hadn’t that advantage himself. He owes his position solely to his own efforts.”</p>

<p>” You think I might apply for this with some chance of securing it?”</p>

<p>” You are safe to secure it if you care to try, since Robson practically leaves the choice of candidate in my hands. It depends on whether you consider it worth your while to turn partly aside from literature for a time. It might serve as a stop-gap till you can give yourself wholly to your art. There’s nothing cripples man more than the feeling that he writing for his next meal.”</p>

<p>” And yet I used to think it a stimulus! ” Carstairs laughed. ” But then I felt confident that the meal would be forthcoming. By accepting this one’s bread would be at least secure.”</p>

<p>” Yes, and you would have a good deal of time to give to what must still be your chosen work. The hours are easy, and the pay not bad.”</p>

<p>” It’s very liberal.”</p>

<p>” It’s to me a great point that you are not expected to be an inmate. Your hours of tuition over, you would be your own master.”</p>

<p>” You tempt me to close with it at once. And yet—I hate to leave London.”</p>

<p>” Better take a week or two to think it over. You see, there is no haste. Robson speaks of October, and we are not in August yet. But there are drawbacks as well as advantages, chief of them that you will be shut up in what I’m told is one of the most dead-alive villages in England, with absolutely no society, and none of the literary helps we’ve got to look upon as our rights in London. Now that’s an experiment a young writer ought not to make if he can help himself. It may do at the end of his life, when he has gathered his store ; but he should buy his experience in the thick of the throng.”</p>

<p>” But if he can’t help himself ? “</p>

<p>” Aye, that’s the rub.”</p>

<p>” Well, if you’ll give me a week to think it out I’ll be glad.
I should have said this morning that wild horses wouldn’t draw me from London, and already I see myself buried in this Arcadia, where I suppose I shall go to sleep like my neighbors ! “</p>

<p>” Why not give this book a chance first ? There is really no such haste to decide. Think of my feelings if I have administered a fatal sleeping draught to a budding Sir Walter ! “</p>

<p>” Think, rather, of the masterly interpretation of rural life you are sending me to make “—he tried to throw some brightness into his leave-taking, though his heart was heavy. ” Seriously, Green, I owe you very grateful thanks, and they aren’t the less sincere because if I had only myself to think of I should prefer to risk starvation here. But I don’t stand alone.”</p>

<p>“What !” said Green, with a face of mock horror. ” You’re not following in Murray’s misguided steps ! “</p>

<p>“Not I!” he laughed; “far be it from me; but I’ve a mother who deserves the little help I can give her ; and you have shown me a way to make that little more.”

<p>” I hope I’ve done right ? ” Green questioned himself when his visitor had gone. ” But how was I to guess that he’d be the thousandth man who takes the advice which the other nine hundred and ninety-nine reject with scorn ? Well, Polly,” he turned to his sister-in-law, who came into the room, her bonnet still untied, and a basket hanging on her arm, “and pray where have you been all this time ? “</p>

<p>” I’ve been shopping,” said the unblushing damsel, with a bold display of her basket. ” I’ve got you some bananas.”</p>

<p>” I had hoped,” said Green, ” that you had spent a profitable hour in convincing a young man that matrimony is incompatible with a literary career. He left this house fully sixty minutes ago with the avowed intention of gaining your views on this point.”</p>

<p>Then that young Carstairs has been here a whole hour ! cried Polly, unexpectedly turning the tables on her tormentor, though she had this time the grace to blush. “Morton, I am disgusted with you, and still more disgusted with that boy, and I shall tell him so when I next see him.”</p>

<p>” My dear, I have been following your example, giving him a little wholesome advice, and with the most surprising results.”</p>

<p>” Did you actually expect him to follow it ? ” she asked scornfully.</p>

<p>” Then you were less successful ? Let me offer you my profound sympathy.”</p>

<p>” I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Miss Polly marched out of the room with her chin in the air. She came back in three mimutes with some beef tea, which she administered with a severe face.</p>

<p>” Poor Polly ! ” he said ungratefully when he had swallowed the last spoonful ; ” so all your eloquence went for nothing ! “</p>

<p>She vouchsafed no rejoinder, but a little later, when she was
shaking his pillows, she whispered :</p>

<p>” If you hadn’t been so very disagreeable, Morton, I might
have told you something, but now I shan’t.”</p>

<p>” My dear girl,” said Morton, laughing, ” you told it me the
moment you came into the room.”</p>

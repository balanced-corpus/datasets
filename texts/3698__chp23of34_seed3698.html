<p>I was placed in a convent at so early an age, that I have not the slightest recollection of any thing before that time. I have been told that I had not completed my third year, when first taken to the convent of Santa Margarita.</p>

<p>I was considered a plaything by the holy sisterhood, and indulged by them to such a degree till I reached the age of ten years, that I ran a great chance of being entirely spoilt.</p>

<p>At about that time, I was informed that I was destined for the cloister. Not having ever been beyond its walls, and knowing nothing of the world but through the report of the nuns, who represented it in dreadful colours, I was perfectly satisfied with the lot that awaited me.</p>

<p>Our convent was in a rude, rocky situation, on the borders of Leon, between Ciudad Rodrigo and the kingdom of Portugal, and here, perhaps, I might have lived and died a nun; but the French, (who had invaded Spain and Portugal,) approaching the nearest town to us, committed such ravages that the peaceful inhabitants of Santa Margarita took fright, and we were conveyed by a detachment of Spaniards into Portugal.</p>

<p>We were at different times removed from place to place, and in different parties dispersed among the various convents on our route.</p>
  
<p>It was my fortune to be conveyed quite across Portugal, to a convent on the coast.</p>


<p>My companions were, our lady abbess, a lay-sister called Bianca, (who had been my constant friend and protectress from the time I had first been placed at St. Margarita,) and eight other nuns.</p>

<p>I was now fifteen years of age, and was looking forwards to the happy day when I should be enrolled among the holy sisterhood.</p>

<p>Our present abode, the convent of Santa Cecilia, was placed in a most wild and picturesque situation. On one side it was faced in by stupendous rocks, whose base the sea was continually lashing with great fury. The other three sides were surrounded by rocks, valleys and mountains, in wild confusion. Our nearest neighbours were a monastery of monks about half a mile distant, and a miserable hamlet in the valley, at the bottom of the rocky eminence on which the convent of Santa Cecilia was situated. A church formed one side of the square of our convent, which was very large. A spacious garden, in which we were permitted to ramble, (as it was completely shut out from observation,) was my  chief delight. One of its barriers was the rock on which the convent was built, and as this rock 
was deemed inaccessible, and was further secured from intrusion by the rude waves which washed its foot, there was no defence, save a 
low, rude wall running along its precipitous edge. The other sides were shut out by the church, (which had no windows opening into 
the garden,) an immense high wall, separating us from the burial ground, and one front of the convent itself, with its noble cloister. Here we hoped for repose, but we soon found the prioress to be a very different person from our own kind and gentle lady abbess.</p> 

<p>A tyrant, a bigot, and devoted to the French interest, she took every opportunity of annoying those whom she suspected of affection 
to the English, who had so generously left their own happy, peaceful land, to assist our countrymen in driving back our cruel and unprincipled invaders. The prioress was also extremely disconcerted at the bishop having placed us at all in her convent, particularly as she soon discovered that our abbess and her small flock were warmly attached to the heretics, as she called our protectors. She made our residence at Santa Cecilia as unpleasant as possible, and I began to dread taking the veil under so imperious and morose a superior.</p>

<p>Time passed but slowly, as it passed unhappily, except when I could walk in the gardens, with our dear abbess, or my friend, Sister Bianca. Every day our situation was more and more unpleasant, and we became aware that the prioress was intriguing with some of the neighbouring disaffected monks, to injure in some way or other the cause of her country, and our brave defenders, the English, a body of whom were stationed at no great distance from the hamlet.</p>

<p>We were roused one night by a tremendous cannonade in the direction of the monastery, and rushing from our cells, found the prioress already dressed, and apparently in high spirits, giving orders to some of the lay sisters to keep up “<em>the fire upon the roof of the tower.</em>” </p>
  
<p>This was evidently meant as a signal, and as some of us mounted to the roof, (the only place from which an uninterrupted view of the surrounding country could be obtained,) we saw fires blazing from the roof of the monastery, and also on one or two rocky heights in its vicinity.</p>

<p>We, who were not in the confidence of the prioress and her party, became seriously alarmed, as we felt convinced that it was a sure sign that the French were in the environs, and would, if successful over the English detachment stationed near the hamlet, (in spite of any assistance they might have received from the prioress,) commit their usual traitorous depredations and ravages; and we were not wrong in our conjectures, for before morning a body of French troops marched upon our convent, and tearing down the doors of the church, began desecrating the sacred edifice, and plundering it of the plate, while another set insisted upon their ally, the prioress, 
delivering up every thing that was valuable, assuring her at the same time, that so soon as they should have dispersed the English in 
the valley, they meant to take up their abode with us. The very thought made our blood run cold, and several of the nuns vowed, that 
so soon as a Frenchman set foot within their holy walls, they would dash themselves from the precipitous rocks into the waves beneath. 
As for me, I clung in speechless agony to our lady abbess, who endeavoured to soothe me, but with such a look of despair as made me 
feel there was no hope. </p>

<p>The French, with their usual impetuosity, had dashed down the side of the mountain  to annihilate, as they expressed it, the miserable islanders.</p>
  
<p>But they found a warmer reception than they expected, though the brave English were only half their numbers. After a desperate conflict, the French were defeated, and the few that remained were driven back in disorder, while our noble defenders marched upon our convent, to assure us of protection. They took up their quarters for the present in the church and its environs, as the commanding officer thought it as unwise as cruel to leave so commanding and defenceless a spot again open to the tender mercies of our pretended friends. </p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the kind and delicate protection and attention we received from the noble English. They had retaken the plunder of the church and convent from the French, and restored it to the prioress; yet that infatuated woman could ill conceal her rage at the discomfiture of her desperate party.</p>
  
<p>I now saw for the first time the <em>English.</em></p>

<p>The officers came to congratulate us upon our safety, and offered to convey us to a convent in the nearest city or fortified town, as a place of greater security, or to continue their protection to us where we were as long as they should be stationed near us.</p>

<p>After this time, the military were in the habit of calling daily at the grate, and I, who had never before seen any man but our aged confessor, and occasionally a gloomy monk, could scarcely take my eyes from the young, the noble, and brilliant soldiers who now met my astonished gaze.</p>

<p>One singled me out, and endeavoured to converse with me in French, a language I did not then understand. He however made himself understood in broken Spanish, and day after day I hung with delight upon his accents, till I could scarcely bear to be out of his sight. How did I count the moments till his return. Need I say that this pleasing stranger, who so won upon my regards, was my dear Enrico.</p>

<p>A stop would soon have been put to these friendly meetings at the grate by the bitter prioress, but she did not dare, now that they were our sole protectors, show her dislike, or I should rather say <em>hatred</em>, to the English; so we went on for several weeks, occupying ourselves, at every leisure moment, in making national cockades, and all sorts of convent trifles, for our friends, who never seemed so happy as in chatting to the simple-hearted 
nuns.</p>

<p>Two months had thus passed away, when part of the regiment stationed immediately near us was ordered off several miles up the country, to intercept a body of French, who, it was reported, were expected to convey provisions to a fortress in their possession.</p> 
  
<p>Enrico was one of the officers selected for this expedition, and when he announced this to me I thought I should have died. Too 
young and inexperienced to conceal my feelings, I gave way to a torrent of tears, while I sobbed out my fears that I should never behold him more.</p> 

<p>He seemed as much affected as myself, and it was fortunate for us that the parlour being crowded by nuns and novices, all eager to 
wish their protectors farewell, they did not notice, while occupied with their own emotions, my more violent ones. In the afternoon the bugles sounded, and from the roof of our prison (for such I now considered it) we could discern the brave soldiers winding down the side of an opposite hill, their colours flying and drums beating. I thought I could never bear to hear military music again.</p>

<p>To describe my wretched feelings during the absence of one who had become so dear to me is impossible; and to add to my distress, our kind abbess was compelled to be absent just at this time, on business connected with our deserted convent.</p>

<p>I stole to the roof of the turret, whenever I could find an opportunity, and strained my eyes in the direction the detachment had taken.</p>

<p>I was one evening watching with intense anxiety, when Bianca ran up, and calling me to follow her, assured me that she had a moment before received certain information that the party had returned, and by a different route, and that it was not improbable but that our friends might, ere long, present themselves at the grate. How my heart beat with fear and hope! At length the sound of feet announced that some of the military were approaching; for our practised ears had begun to distinguish between their regular tread and that of the sluggish monks or boorish peasants. </p>
  
<p>Heedless of the consequences, several of us flew to the parlour, and there, standing at the grate, we found our long absent friends, and my dear Enrico amongst the number. Our joy was unbounded, and he hastened to assure me that this separation had made him more      attached to me than ever, and that he should be miserable if our fates were not united. The idea, he said, of leaving me in that 
troubled land, and unprotected, was insupportable, and he implored me to give up all thoughts of taking the veil. I was but too willing to listen to his entreaties, but I assured him that I was not mistress of my own actions, and that I believed I <em>must</em> obey the dictates of those who had originally placed me in a convent. Who they were I never knew. All I <em>did</em> know was, that I had been intended for a religious life, and that I was now a novice, preparatory to my taking the first veil the following year.</p>

<p>He would not listen to this barbarous sacrifice, and implored me to trust in him, and be prepared the following day to receive a written plan for our proceedings, and to take it into my most serious consideration. We parted, I to disclose to my faithful Bianca all that had passed between my lover and myself. She declared that it would make her the happiest creature alive, to see me safe out of this hateful place, and the happy wife of a brave Englishman. Thus encouraged, I felt neither scruples nor hesitation in resolving to adopt any plan laid down for me by my beloved Enrico.</p>

<p>There were at this time two ladies boarding in our convent, the wives of the colonel and major in the dragoon regiment, of which Lord Henry Villeroi was one of the captains.</p>

<p>From both these ladies, who were Irish, I received the greatest kindness, and it was in great measure by their means and influence that the English officers were allowed to come so often to the grate.</p>

<p>The following day our brave friends, as usual, paid us a visit, and Enrico contrived to give me, unseen, the letter he had mentioned.</p>

<p>I promised it should have my best attention, and as soon as he was gone I retired to my cell to read it, which was an easy task, as it was written in Spanish. His plan was this:—He implored me to give him a meeting at midnight, accompanied by Bianca, in the convent church, where he would be waiting with a priest, who had promised to unite us. Enrico would then return to his quarters, and I should go back to my cell, as he had no place in which he could then leave me in safety. But so soon as his troop should be ordered from its present position, (which was daily expected,) he would come to the convent, accompanied by the colonel and major, when they came for their wives, proclaim our marriage, and insist upon bringing me off at the same time. He declared he should wait every night, at the hour appointed, in the church, till I came, when he would secure me his for ever. I need not say that I was overjoyed at his proposal. The idea of being united to him, and leaving for ever the detested prioress and her tyrannical sway, was too delightful to be rejected, though I felt a sad pang at the thought of being separated for ever, perhaps, from our dear lady abbess and my affectionate friend Bianca. The project of getting into the church at <em>any</em> hour, unseen, seemed wild and impossible, as every avenue to it was secured by locks, the keys of which were in the close keeping of the prioress.</p>
 
<p>Upon consulting Bianca, she, though of a very sanguine and active disposition, felt almost persuaded of the impracticability of gaining access to the desired spot.</p>

<p>At my next conversation with Enrico, I told him of our fears, but he could not believe it to be so impossible as we described. He persisted in saying that he should be there <em>that</em> night, and every night till we met. He urged me to persuade Bianca to get the impression of the key in wax, and give it to him, when he could get one made by the smith of the regiment. I mentioned this plan to Bianca, and she determined to use every effort to effect it.</p>
  
<p>There were three entrances from the convent into the church. One through some vaults, but that way was quite out of the question, as the entrance was through a trap-door in the private sleeping-apartment of the prioress; the second approach was from the roof of the convent, where there was an opening to the roof of the church, but this seemed as impracticable for our purpose as the other, for without an immensely long ladder it was impossible to descend into the church; the third and last approach was by a door half way up a turret, in which was the bell that summoned us to prayers. Now this door was the one through which the nuns passed to their devotions, and led to the galleries and seats round the church occupied by them, and which had no communication with the body or lower part of the church, so that if I could even get through that door, I should still be separated from those below. Besides, the prioress kept this key, and never suffered it out of her possession, except for an hour, once a week, to the sister who cleaned out the passages and seats. All these facts I mentioned to Enrico.</p>

<p>“Get but the impression of that key, my darling Clara, and I will answer for conveying you safe down into the body of the church, 
and back again, as soon as the ceremony is concluded which makes you mine.”</p> 

<p>This I repeated to Bianca, who instantly took steps to immediate intimacy with the sister who was entrusted with the care of the 
galleries for the purpose I before mentioned.</p> 

<p>I never shall forget the agony of suspense which I endured during the few days this affair was in progress, nor how my heart beat 
as I watched Bianca chatting to sister Inisilla, and trying to get into her good graces.</p> 
  
<p>At length, about a fortnight after she had commenced operations, and which Enrico and myself considered an age, she came into my cell, and seating herself by my side, drew forth a piece of wax, on which was moulded the longwished-for impression.</p> 

<p>I could scarcely refrain from a cry of delight, but my older and more prudent friend placing her hand on my lips, I suppressed it, while I kissed the precious wax a thousand times.</p>

<p>The next day it was in the possession of my dear Enrico, and the morning after that he slipped into my hand the key which I hoped was to open a door to liberty and love.</p>

<p>That night we were, as usual, bolted into our cells, but Bianca had contrived, by fastening a string in a particular way, to enable us to pull backwards and forwards (from the inside) the bolts at pleasure, and as our cells opened into the cloister, at one end of which was the turret, we had no further obstacle between us and the dreaded door.</p>

<p>The chimes sounded midnight, and nothing broke in upon the silence but the dashing of the waves at the foot of the rocks.</p> 

<p>I was ready dressed, and standing by the grate of my little window, when a shadow passed it. I fancied I could <em>hear</em> my heart beat.</p>

<p>A low whisper, and the door softly opened. It was my faithful Bianca.</p>

<p>“Courage, my sweet Clara,” she whispered; “take my arm, and do not breathe a word.”</p>

<p>I did as I was desired. We crept softly along the side of the cloister which was the darkest, for though there was no moon, the stars were very bright.</p>
  
<p>We reached the end of it in safety, and mounting the turret-stair, we found ourselves close to the door, which opened upon the nun’s gallery. I cannot express what I felt when Bianca put the key into the lock.</p>

<p>She had not had any opportunity of trying it, and the horror I felt lest it should not fit almost overpowered me. </p>

<p>It seemed at first as if she could not turn it, when, to my delight, it gave way, and the next moment we were in the narrow gallery which is made in the thickness of the walls, and which is so contrived, that though the nuns can see the performance of the service below, no one can see them.</p> 

<p>I had not advanced two yards, when I saw, by the faint light which issued through a narrow window, a dark object near it, and which, if I moved forwards, I must meet. I felt certain it could only be a nun, perhaps the dreaded prioress herself. The least punishment that would await us, if discovered, would be imprisonment for life, in the damp and dreadful vaults of the convent. I suppressed the scream which was rising to my lips, but, terrified beyond all endurance, I sunk on the ground. </p>

<p>In a moment, as I dreaded, the figure approached, but conceive my rapture, my surprise, and ecstasy, when I heard the dear voice of 
Enrico pronouncing softly my name. For the first time I was clasped in his arms.</p> 

<p>Not a moment was to be lost; he hurried me on to the spot where hung a ladder of ropes, by which we descended into the body of the 
church. There we were met by his intimate friend, Captain M’Donald, and, the monk who was to unite us. Bianca had thought it best to remain close to the door by which we had entered from the turret, in case of a surprise. </p>

<p>I was conducted into a small private chapel, where, by the light of a shaded lamp, the ceremony was performed which made me the wife 
of my beloved Enrico.</p> 

<p>I entreated to be taken back as quickly as possible to the gallery, so much did I dread being missed. We parted with a thousand vows of love and constancy, and a hope that, upon a removal of the brigade, nothing would then prevent my being acknowledged by and accompanying my dear husband. He saw me safe through the gallery, and to the door which opened upon the turret staircase, where my kind Bianca was waiting for me.</p> 

<p>We hurried softly down, after securing the door behind us, and reached our cells in safety.</p> 

<p>There I lay on my hard mattress, half dead from fright at the step I had taken, and resolved to impart it to my dear and constant friend, our lady abbess, on her return.</p> 

<p>The following morning no one was admitted to the grate, it being a solemn fast, but the next day the officers came as usual, and with them my dear husband. He told me they had hopes of being removed into Oporto, in the course of a month, and that he should then come and claim me openly as his wife. He entreated that in the mean time I would allow him to see me (in company of Bianca) in the gallery of the church, after the sisterhood had retired for the night. Much as I loved and wished to be with him, I positively refused this, as I dreaded that the virgin and all the saints would rise and punish me for such sacrilege. Had it been in any other place than a church, I would have gladly flown to him.</p>

<p>A fortnight after this event, and when every thing appeared to be arranged for the removal of the troops to Oporto, an order came for the dragoons, and part of an infantry regiment stationed in the neighbourhood, to march up the country on some secret expedition.</p>

<p>My husband was one of the number, and when he came to take his leave I really thought my heart would break. He tried to keep up my spirits, but in vain. A kind of presentiment hung about me, that I should see him no more. They were to set off at break of day, and Enrico implored me, on this last night, not to deny him the sad pleasure of a parting embrace. He declared he would be in the nun’s gallery at midnight, and wait there, whether I came or not, till the last moment. How was it possible to refuse. I therefore promised, if nothing prevented me, to be in the gallery at twelve o’clock.</p> 

<p>I waited with trembling anxiety for that hour, and thought it sounded more solemnly than usual, and that it would never cease striking.</p> 

<p>I was in the cloisters, (having let myself out of my cell,) and standing close to one of the pillars, waiting for Bianca, as the chimes finished, when a step approached, and I was just going to speak, thinking, of course, it was my friend, when fortunately I checked myself, for in an instant the prioress passed close to me, at a rapid pace. Had she not been in such haste she must have seen me. I was ready to faint, fully supposing that she had discovered my intended visit to the church.</p>  

<p>I watched her figure with intense anxiety, and was in some measure relieved when I saw her emerge from the cloisters, and cross the garden. She had scarcely vanished, when some one touched me. It was Bianca. She had also seen the prioress, and had concealed herself till she was out of sight.</p> 

<p>“What is to be done?” I whispered. “Must we return to our cells, and Enrico go without our saying farewell?”</p>

<p>“Not so,” said my kind friend; “we must take advantage of this moment and hurry up the turret. I have taken the precaution to bolt our cells on the <em>outside</em>, so that the prioress, if she looks, will not suspect our absence. I am certain,” continued Bianca, “that she is gone to the door which opens upon the burial-ground, there to have a private conference with her confessor. I have often watched her meet him there before.” </p>
  
<p>Saying this, she hurried me up the stairs, and gently unlocking the door, we found ourselves in the narrow gallery.</p>

<p>In a moment my husband, my dear, dear husband was at my side. I told him of our narrow escape, and my fears, which he soothed, though he could not dispel them.</p>

<p>Bianca held and watched the door, while we held a whispered conversation.</p>

<p>He implored me to keep up my spirits, talked of his speedy return, and that when we met again, it would be to part no more.</p>

<p>We remained above an hour in the gallery, often saying farewell, and hardly having courage to tear ourselves asunder. At last my fears lest he should be discovered, which I knew too well would bring on him the secret and brutal vengeance of the bigoted monks, got the better of my wish to remain, and, almost suffocated by tears and sobs, we bade each other adieu; he to join the detachment, and start on a desperate expedition, I to return to the dismal solitude of my cell.</p>
  
<p>Hardly able to stand from grief and agitation, I clung to Bianca, who, after securing the door, led me to the foot of the winding stair, where she left me, while she went to reconnoitre if the coast were clear.</p>

<p>In a few minutes she returned, and we hurried trembling and silent through the cloisters to our separate cells. Never shall I forget that wretched night. I could scarcely see the following morning from the tears I had unceasingly shed.</p>

<p>Occupied as I was with my own sorrows, I could not be insensible to those of many of the unhappy girls by whom I was surrounded. One young nun in particular, Sister Inez, attracted my attention. She seemed broken-hearted, and I felt convinced that her affections, like my own, were bestowed upon one of those despatched on this secret expedition.</p>

<p>She was a very lovely girl, of good family, and had been forced (a few months back) to take the vows, in order that her portion might be bestowed on her brother, the better to enable him to keep up the dignity of his house. The cruelty of this is undeniable, but it is a very common thing, both in Spain and Portugal, for sisters to be thus shamefully sacrificed in the very bloom of youth, and in defiance of
their tears and prayers, to enrich an already amply provided for, haughty brother.</p> 

<p>I need not dwell on the miserable state of my own feelings, nor the gloom which pervaded the convent during the absence of our friends and protectors, which was prolonged beyond the time specified. The prioress alone seemed in high spirits.</p> 

<p>At length, one evening, while in a miserable state of suspense, the two Irish ladies, whom I have before named, were summoned to the 
grate. As their husbands were in the same troop as mine, I begged them to allow me to accompany them. When we entered the parlour, we found it nearly filled with nuns and novices, eagerly inquiring after some one or other. I hastened forwards, and saw several officers at the grate; amongst them, two or three who I knew had been of the same 
party as my husband. I soon saw <em>he</em> was not there, and noticed that one of his comrades had lost an arm, and that the others looked extremely pale and weak. They had, then, been wounded. Where was he? I dared not ask: indeed I could scarcely breathe. Bianca at length pushed through the crowd, and I heard her say to the young officer who had lost his arm, “Where is Lord Henry Villeroi?”</p> 
  
<p>“Ah! poor fellow,” he answered; <em>“he is dead!</em> He was killed early in the action.”</p> 
  
<p>I heard no more, but fell senseless on the ground. While I have life, I shall never forget the horror of that moment.</p>

<p>For two days I was nearly frantic, and had it not been for the unwearied care of Bianca, and our kind abbess, (who returned a few days after,) I really do think I should have lost my senses. As it was, I soon became the shadow of my former self. I felt that my heart was breaking, and resolved to lose no time in taking those vows which, only a few weeks before, had appeared so detestable in my eyes. I never again entered the parlour, for the sight of the grate where I first beheld my beloved husband, would have been insupportable to me. I spoke to no one but the abbess and Bianca, and passed all the time I could steal from my duties in roaming gloomily about the convent garden, and in leaning over the rocky ledge that hung over the sea. May God forgive me, but I often longed to throw myself into the abyss beneath; and I believe I should have done so, had I thought I should meet my beloved in another world, but I had been taught to believe it impossible for a heretic to enter the kingdom of heaven.</p> 

<p>How grateful I ought to be that I have since learnt a better and wiser doctrine than the uncharitable and unchristian one which had been poured into my young and inexperienced mind. </p>

<p>Time rolled on, and I imparted to the lady abbess my desire to hasten the necessary preliminaries for my taking the veil, as I was anxious to separate myself for ever from a world which had no longer any charms for me; and which, now that I could not share its pleasures or wonders with my poor Enrico, I was sure I should hate.</p> 

<p>My kind friend urged me to do nothing in a hurry, and pressed upon me that having once taken the vows, I could never retract, and that I might repent too late. </p>
  
<p>“No, no,” I replied, “I have nothing to regret; I have no husband, no father, no mother, no one to care for me, and the sooner  I am dead the better. My parents and friends have never even inquired after me during the long years of my seclusion. It is plain I am an outcast, abandoned by the whole world!”</p>

<p>“Oh! say not so, my sweet child,” said the abbess, in great agitation, while tears streamed down her cheeks. “Have I not loved you as a 
mother ever since you have been under my care, and if it were not for <em>you</em>, my dear Clara, I would not remain one hour longer in this place.” </p>

<p>“You have ever been kindness itself to me, holy mother, and so has Sister Bianca, but that cannot atone for the shameful neglect which 
you must be aware has been shown towards me by my natural parents. Poor deserted wretch that I am, without <em>one</em> human being I can call by the tender name of relative.” </p>
  
<p>I was roused from my own violent agitation by that of the lady abbess, whose sobs and tears appeared ready to suffocate her; while stooping down and raising me from her feet, where I was sitting with my head resting upon her knees, she clasped me in her arms, exclaiming in a low suffocated voice, “Clara, my beloved Clara, I—I am thy mother, thy fond, thy wretched mother.”</p> 

<p>Words cannot express the astonishment with which I listened to these words. My tears were dried at once, while I gazed incredulously on her face, which was agitated by a thousand contending emotions. She almost smothered me with kisses, while she murmured, “My poor child, are you sorry to find your mother in a poor nun, who loves you, and has always loved you with a fondness and an ardour which it has been one of her hardest trials to conceal? Nothing but the sight of your sufferings, my darling child, should have forced this confession from me, though a thousand times I have been on the point of relieving my bursting heart by telling you how very near and inexpressibly dear you were to me.</p> 
  
<p>“The secret of your birth is only known to  three other persons living, besides Bianca and  myself, and it is of the utmost consequence to my peace that it should still be concealed.</p> 
   
<p>“Listen, Clara, while I impart to you the particulars of your birth; and while you hear of my sorrows and trials, perhaps they may lighten your own.”</p> 
  
<p>I was as may be supposed all attention, and my poor mother, endeavouring to compose her agitated feelings, while she fondly placed my head on her throbbing bosom, proceeded to detail the melancholy history of her unhappy life. </p>

<p>A private marriage with the secretary of the Portuguese ambassador so highly incensed her father, who was a grandee of Spain, that she was compelled to take the veil, while her husband fell a victim to the resentment of her infuriated relatives. <em>I</em> should also have been sacrificed, had not Bianca, the sister of my father, at imminent hazard to herself, saved and concealed me, and at length contrived to 
join my mother with me in the convent where she was immured.</p> 
  
<p>This faithful friend never afterwards quitted us, and to her devotion for myself I could bear ample witness.</p> 

<p>After my mother had finished her unhappy tale, she said,</p> 

<p>“And now, my dearest Clara, do not embitter the remainder of my life, which has been sufficiently miserable, by seeing you sacrifice 
yourself as I was obliged to do.” </p>
  
<p>When my mother finished speaking she embraced me with a tenderness which soothed, though it could not console me under the recollection of her sufferings and my own.</p> 
  
<p>I promised, however, not to take the veil, or indeed any other step, without her sanction, and retired to my cell, certainly less wretched than when I left it, though, God knows, miserable enough.</p>

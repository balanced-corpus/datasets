<p>“A FOOL’S WRATH.”</p>

<p>The village of Drumbitter was not far from Garycross, and in the village, as has already been mentioned, there was a corn-mill.</p>

<p>Its owner was Mr. Carsewell, who, with his wife and son, Sam, the one child of their old age, lived in the neighbourhood of Ballynahaugh.</p>

<p>The mill was not under any obligation to the Gary, being turned by he water of another stream, which, though rising near the same source, flowed in an entirely opposite direction.</p>

<p>Two or three times every week, Sam Carsewell rode over to settle accounts with the miller, and chat to the men who daily gathered round the kiln fire, over which their corn was dried on a metal floor.</p>

<p>A little way above the mill was the dam, where the water that turned it was collected by means of sluices, and let off as it was required.</p>

<p>On the second of May, when Ruth wanted to go home, Letty declared, in her usual peremptory way:</p>

<p>“You cannot return to-day, my child, for you are coming with me to see the sheep plunged in the mill-dam.”</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who know nothing of sheep-farming, I may explain—what there was no need to explain to Ruth—that it improves the quality of wool to wash it on the sheeps’ back, before they are shorn, and that every spring Mr. Gregg drove his woolly flock to the mill-dam, and had them washed there, regardless alike of their piteous expostulations, and of the still more heart-rending lamentations of the lambs shut up at home, when their dams were driven away.</p> 

<p>The sheep-washing had been one of Letty’s yearly-recurring delights in her childhood, and now that she was a woman she enjoyed it still.</p>

<p>It was not often that Ruth rebelled against her friend’s authority, and to-day she was nothing loth to obey her. The cheerful sunny atmosphere of Garycross was as refreshing to her mental and moral nature, as the bracing air from the hills that surrounded it, was to her physical, and she had too poetic a temperament, not to be keenly alive to the beauty of all pastoral scenes, although in the present instance, her enjoyment of the sight was a good deal marred by the sounds which accompanied it.</p>

<p>The cavalcade which left Garycross was quite a formidable one. First there were the sheep themselves, about forty in number, very dirty, very ragged, and bleating simultaneously and incessantly as they trotted along. The old ram did not trot, but marched at their head in dignified silence.</p>

<p>Close at the heels of the flock, ready to dart forward, and turn any foolish ewe who evinced a desire to stray from the path of duty, came Cæsar, Letty’s grave and sagacious mastiff, who, without seeming to observe anything, was constantly on the alert to guard Garycross and all that it contained. He walked in the middle of the road, with his eyes directed straight before him; but he kept a sharp look-out from the corners of them, for he well knew that sheep are almost as silly as human beings, in the readiness with which they follow each other into mischief, and that if one were to stray, the example would be followed by the entire flock.</p>

<p>Tim and the other men-servants followed Cæsar, and the maids followed them; the latter were not going with the intention of being of any use on the occasion, but merely to watch the fun. Mr. Gregg came last, with Letty and Ruth; while Biddy Mehargh, an old retainer of the family, walked a pace or two in front of him, looking as sulky and almost as dignified as the old ram himself.</p>

<p>The bipeds of the procession were all very merry, with the exception of Biddy, who had never been really merry in her life, and had, now in her old days, sunk into a chronic state of thankless grumbling, at everything in general, and her benefactors in particular.</p>

<p>“Look at the father of the flock,” laughed Letty; “his anticipations of the martyrdom in store for him are as bitter as those of the members of his harem, but his great soul scorns to ease its grief by weak lamentations, in the hearing of his persecutors. I wonder whether he is brooding over his wrongs, or meditating revenge, as he marches along, in such stately fashion.”</p>

<p>“If he be doing the one, he is pretty certain to do the other, for the revengeful spirit is the natural growth of the brooding spirit,” said Mr. Gregg.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is classical, and is trying to diver his mind, by thinking of his great ancestor, who bore Ulysses from the cave of Polyphemus,” put in Ruth.</p>

<p>It is small consolation his honourable ancestry will be to him, when he is in the water,” returned Letty; and then, after a moment’s silence, she exclaimed, “What a glorious day it is, and how beautiful the hills are looking! I wonder how any one can live on low ground; it is as bad as being in narrow-minded society.”</p>

<p>“Human society is all more or less narrow-minded, Letty,” said her father.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but some of it is more. After spending an evening in a few houses I could name, I feel inclined to run up to the top of a mountain and stretch myself, like Samson.”</p>

<p>“The Bible says he shook himself,” Ruth corrected.</p>

<p>“Well, you little literalist, I would like sometimes to shake myself first and stretch myself afterwards—shake off all the mildew of bigotry and littleness that may have settled on me, and then open my lungs—so—to inhale the unpolluted air of heaven.”</p>

<p>She lifted both her hands above her head, as she spoke, with an easy motion that was the very perfection of grace and strength. As they dropped to her side again, one of them was caught from behind, and she turned and saw her lover.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. O’Kane, are you there again?” she asked, in a tone of lively astonishment.</p>

<p>“It seems so,” he answered, coolly, as he took his place by her side. “Mrs. Gregg told me where you were going, and said I was to follow and see that you conducted yourself with propriety.”</p>

<p>“Letty always conducts herself with propriety, Mr. O’Kane,” said Ruth, rather indignantly.</p>

<p>“Indeed I do not; I would be very sorry,” Letty contradicted, while her father said, with a benign smile:</p>

<p>“No matter what Letty does, there is always a propriety in it, because it is so in harmony with herself.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, pappy,” laughed Letty. “I may be as wild as I like after that, for the more mad-headed I am, the more it will be in harmony with my character.”</p>

<p>They went on chatting gaily, while the servants joked and laughed in advance of them, and the sheep trotted along bleating, till Drumbitter was reached. Young Sam Carsewell was at the mill, and came out to meet Mr. Gregg.</p>

<p>“My man said you were to bring them to-day, and the sluices have been closed since yesterday,” he said, bowing to Ruth and Mr. O’Kane, and shaking hands with Letty and her father.</p>

<p>“For us or the sheep—which, Mr. Carsewell?” asked Letty.</p>

<p>“I meant for the sheep, Miss Gregg,” he answered, looking a little bashful, but not at all awkward, as his honest blue eye fell before the laughing glance of hers.</p>

<p>“Miss Gregg is as grand in her air as a duchess, but overbold for a maiden,” Sam told his old mother afterwards.</p>

<p>The sheep were all driven into a stable adjoining the mill, and then led out one by one to the dam, where they were ruthlessly pushed into the water, and kept there, in spite of all their efforts to escape over the bank, till they were clean washed.</p>

<p>The poor sheep did not enjoy it; but the spectators and operators did, and none of them more so than Tim the ostler, who stood with a pole in his hand, and as soon as an unlucky animal had almost succeeded in clambering out of the water, would push it back again, amid the loud laughter of the servants and Tim’s own exclamations of:</p>

<p>“Tim will do it; he won’t let her out till she has had a good dip!”</p>

<p>When at last the sheep was supposed to be clean, Mr. Gregg would call:</p>

<p>“That will do, Tim.”</p>

<p>And Tim would stand aside and allow her to come to land, and run bleating and dripping with water to another house, into which she was driven by Cæsar and some of the men. Then another victim was brought out, and another, and so on, till all the flock had been plunged, except the old ram.</p>

<p>But the most difficult part of the business was yet to come, as the men knew, from past experience.</p>

<p>“What are they waiting for?” asked Mr. O’Kane, when he saw them lingering outside the stable-door, and all talking and suggesting in the same breath, while Time kept repeating:</p>

<p>“Let Tim at him; he’ll do it, never fear!”</p>

<p>“They are afraid to engage the old ram; he always gives us a great deal of trouble,” answered Mr. Gregg, going forward to encourage his men.</p>

<p>Mr. O’Kane, who had hitherto been a rather uninterested spectator, followed him, and so did the others; and then all stood in a group, waiting for the ram to be led out.</p>

<p>When the door was opened, he was found standing in the middle of the floor, with his head slightly lowered, and such a look of dogged determination in his whole air that the maids ran away in affright, the moment they saw him.</p>

<p>“Slip quietly round behind him,” said Mr. Gregg to one of the men, who obeyed none too willingly. But the ram was too good a general to allow himself to be outflanked, and just as the man was congratulating himself that he had got beyond the animal’s range of vision, he turned and charged him so suddenly, that he had scarcely time to leap to one side and make his escape by the door; while the ram, with lowered head, butted full tilt against the wall, where his enemy had been the moment before.</p>

<p>The man absolutely refused to risk another encounter, and all the others seemed equally afraid, till Miss Gregg called out:</p>

<p>“Come, Tim, you are not such a coward as to let yourself be beaten by a sheep; go and take the brute to the water like a good boy.”</p>

<p>“Tim will, Miss Gregg; he’ll do it, never fear,” answered the ostler, pulling a lock of hair that hung over his forehead, by way of a salute.</p>

<p>“He is sure to do it,” said Letty to Mr. O’Kane; “he would do anything in the world for me.”</p>

<p>Connor looked as if he did not wonder at it, but he knew better than to say so in the presence of others. What he did say was, “How strange!” in a tone of such extreme astonishment, that Letty laughed, in spite of herself, and rewarded him with the first kind glance she had condescended to bestow upon him that day.</p>

<p>Tim did not wait for his courage to cool, but rushed to the encounter at once—literally rushed, for, as the ram stood waiting with lowered head for the next attack, Tim dashed past, and before the deluded brute could turn to face him, had leaped on his back with a triumphant shout of:</p>

<p>“Hih, old daddy! Tim said he’d do it, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>A loud laugh, from the men assembled at the stable-door, rewarded his exploit and served further to enrage the already half-maddened ram, who stamped with rage when he found himself so suddenly bestridden. But it was in vain that he stamped and plunged and backed against the wall, Tim held on tightly by his ears, shouting derisively:</p>

<p>“Go it, daddy! dance a hornpipe! How do ye like bein’ turned into a baste of burden ye ould reprobate?”</p>

<p>Mr. Gregg had been laughing as heartily as any one, but, after a little, he wiped his eyes, saying:</p>

<p>“You are a very clever fellow, Tim, but if you were to stay on his back all night it wouldn’t take him to the water.”</p>

<p>“Dad! Tim never thought of that!” answered the lad, who had been feeling as proud as a general after a bloodless victory, and now looked rather taken aback, to find that his successful occupation of the enemy’s stronghold was, after all, barren of any good result.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Tim will stay where he is,” he added, in a resigned tone, after half a minute’s open-mouthed reflection.</p>

<p>“That is right, Tim, stick to your post,” laughed Letty. “You have done your duty manfully, and now let others do theirs.”</p>

<p>“He will, Miss Gregg, he will,” Tim answered, his face brightening agin into a grin, as he removed a hand from one of the ram’s ears, to touch his forelock to his young mistress.</p>

<p>The ram, feeling himself partially freed, took the opportunity of removing his tail from the wall, into which he had seemed intent on burrowing backwards, and made a spring for the door—thereby almost unseating his rider. But Tim caught him again, as he was bounding forward, and the baffled animal stopped short, and stood in the middle of the floor, looking dogged defiance at his enemies; while Tim, astride of his back, stood and grinned.</p>

<p>“Some of you go behind and push the poor brute down to the water; he can’t butt you when Tim has hold of him,” Mr. Gregg gave orders.</p>

<p>Two of the men obeyed him, and, in spite of the animal’s determined efforts to execute a masterly retreat to the back wall, he was pushed out by the door; and then between pushed out by the door; and then between pushing and pulling was at length forced to the dam, amid the loud laughter of Mr. Gregg’s retainers, and the mob of ragged boys who had gathered to watch the sport—as ragged boys always do gather, whether in town or country, at the first scent of any thing affording the smallest excitement, from a monarch passing to his coronation, to a horse stumbling under his load.</p>

<p>Tim continued to shout, “Hih! old daddy,” in tones of triumph till he and his unwilling steed reached the edge of the water. But his triumph ended there; the ram, who had hitherto been using all his strength in resisting the efforts made to keep him moving on, was suddenly struck by a brilliant idea, and giving an unexpected leap forward, took his rider with him over the bank.</p>

<p>The laughter was louder than ever, as man and beast sank together in the water, but Tim did not join in it this time. The ram swam to the other side of the dam, where the bank was low, and landing there, stalked off to where his numerous wives were immured, and stationing himself at the door, stood in sullen majesty, as if defying his tormentors to come on again.</p>

<p>Tim did not rise to the surface so soon as the ram, and when his long hair was next seen, the face that it overhung had lost all its vacant blandness of expression. As he shook his eyes clear from the water he looked angrily at his fellow-servants, evidently considering that they had been in league with his foe, to bring about the catastrophe. The laughter was louder than ever now, and jeers and rough jokes at Tim’s expense increased his impotent rage, till he cursed and swore with fury, as he made for the shore. He had almost reached the bank, when the spirit of wanton mischief that is inherent in masculine natures, prompted one of the men to pick up the pole that had been used for the sheep, and pushed him with it, back again into the water.</p>

<p>Tim was foaming with passion when he rose again to his feet, and the most of the spectators were convulsed with merriment; but Ruth put her hands up to her ears, to shut out poor Tim’s blasphemies, and Letty, without giving her father time to interfere, exclaimed angrily:</p>

<p>“Alick, put down that pole immediately, sirrah!” How dare you torment the poor innocent?”</p>

<p>The man obeyed her at once, staying apologetically:</p>

<p>“It was only a bit of fun, Miss Letty.”</p>

<p>“Rare fun to half drown a defenceless boy! If I ever know of you tormenting him again I’ll horsewhip you,” she answered, indignantly.</p>

<p>Then her whole face and manner changing, she went close to the edge of the dam and holding out her hand, called:</p>

<p>“Come, Tim.”</p>

<p>The lad choked a volley of oaths midway, as soon as she spoke, and taking the hand she extended to him, scrambled out of the water in sullen silence.</p>

<p>“Poor Time, no one shall tease you,” she said, almost tenderly, as she helped him to land.</p>

<p>“Oh Miss Gregg! poor Tim! poor Tim!” he cried, bursting into a violent fit of weeping.</p>

<p>“Poor Time, never mind,” she answered, soothingly, “run home as fast as you can and go to bed, and to-morrow you shall have apple dumpling.”</p>

<p>“Sure?” he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Quite sure, if you have your wet clothes off and are in bed in half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Tim will do it,” he said, and pulling his dripping forelock once more, he trotted off, and was out of sight in a moment.</p>

<p>No one was laughing now, and the tears were in Ruth’s eyes. When all that was to be seen of the lad was a little stream of water, marking the road he had taken, Letty turned to Mr. O’Kane, who was looking very grave. She feared that her vehement manner of reproving Alick had displeased him, and careless as she was of the opinion of the world in general, she was uncomfortably conscious of a particular desire not to appear unwomanly in the eyes of Connor.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Mr. O’Kane?” she asked, prepared to annihilate him by a glance, did he venture to find fault with her; but as soon as she spoke, she saw that he had not been thinking of her at all.</p>

<p>“Nothing is the matter,” he answered, brightening up at once.</p>

<p>“Indeed! I was not aware that you usually looked so diabolical; it is well you told me.”</p>

<p>He laughed outright then, and answered:</p>

<p>“I meant that there is nothing the matter, now—it was but a painful memory.”</p>

<p>“Well, dismiss painful memories if they make you look like that, and come and be weighed in the mill. They will not try the old ram again, and papa is going home immediately, but Ruth and I shall stay a little longer.”</p>

<p>The weighing was a source of fresh amusement. Letty got Mr. Carsewell to weigh her, first against himself, and then against Connor, and insisted that she was heavier than either; but when the weights were put on, and it was discovered that thirteen stones did not turn the scale against her, she was astonished, till a twinkle in Connor’s eye revealed the fact that he had slipped a two stone weight on her scale, under covers of her skirts. Letty was indignant at the trick, and punished him for it by ignoring his presence for the next hour, while she went about with Mr. Carsewell, and was initiated into the mysteries of cog-wheels and fans, and whitened her red lips, by eating new meal from other people’s sacks.</p>

<p>Connor followed them for a little, and then, he went and sat down beside Ruth, who was watching a kingfisher flashing to and fro along the bank of the river, as it watched for its prey.</p>

<p>“Isn’t everything lovely?” she asked, turning to him with eyes full of sweetness; and they sat and talked till Letty was ready to go home—which was perhaps sooner than it would have been, had Connor not preferred a duet with Ruth to a trio in which Sam Carsewell was a performer.</p>

<p>“What a pleasant day it has been,” Letty exclaimed, as she stopped at the bridge on their way home, and began picking off pieces of moss, and throwing them in the water.</p>

<p>“Days are all pleasant, now,” answered Connor, watching her contentedly.</p>

<p>“Yes; isn’t it strange how some people’s days are all full of pleasure, while other people’s are full of pain?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the days that seem full of pain are really the happiest,” suggested Ruth.</p>

<p>“A very pretty philosophy, my child, for painful days, should they ever come; but at present, I prefer to take out my happiness in some other way, and to delude myself with the idea thatI am better off than if I were bedridden or crossed in love, or laid up with stiff joints, as, I am sure, Black Prince will soon be, considering the number of journeys he is compelled to take between her and Lisnegarvey.”</p>

<p>“I thought of that, and walked this morning,” said Connor, “so it is <em>my</em> joints that are in danger, and not those of Black Prince.”</p>

<p>“Poor little joints!” ejaculated Letty with a whimsical glance at her lover’s knee-breeches.</p>

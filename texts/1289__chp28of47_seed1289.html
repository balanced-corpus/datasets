<title>Chapter 28 (10 of vol.2) of The Story of Helen Davenant by Violet Fane</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>
I will not attempt to describe my misery when I came to realise more fully my unfortunate 
position. Miss Warden drove into Nice, and informed Mrs. Marks of the cause of my new unhappiness. 
They both agreed that it would be impossible for me, now, to continue to conceal my marriage. 
Nevertheless, I pleaded for a little longer delay, for I dreaded to tell my father of what I had 
done whilst his health was in such a critical condition. Even the doctor advised me to wait for 
a few days at least. 
</p>
<p>
Sir Harry appeared, certainly, to take very little interest in me or my doings; but, like all 
invalids who suffer from nervous illness, he was subject to strange alternations of temper, and 
his fits of violence and irritability were so injurious to him that we feared to run the risk of 
provoking one of them. 
</p>
<p>
All anxiety upon this subject, however, was brought to an abrupt termination before I had made up 
my mind how and when I should communicate my dreadful news. A few days after the doctor’s visit to 
me my father had another paralytic stroke. He was unconscious for nearly a week after this seizure. 
Then he rallied a little, and seemed to have something upon his mind which he tried hard to put into 
words. It was almost impossible, however, for us to understand what he said, his voice was so changed 
and weakened. At last Mason made out by the movement of his lips that he was asking for “Nelly,”—-a 
name by which he had very seldom addressed me of late years. Generally, now, he alluded to me as “the 
child,” or “the girl.” When I came to his bed-side he nodded his head and appeared more satisfied. Then 
he talked for some time very indistinctly and incoherently—-turning, from time to time, to some one 
whom he seemed to fancy was standing upon the other side of his bed. By listening with the greatest 
attention we thought we caught the words “not a bad sort of girl,” and then he said, much more distinctly, 
“I will have no scandal; bear in mind, Courtenay! no cackling!” 
</p>
<p>
“He fancies that he’s speaking to the Colonel,” whispered Mason, when he again turned to where he appeared 
to see an imaginary figure; “he is making up a marriage between Colonel Davenant and Miss Helen,” and the 
poor woman sighed, feeling, no doubt, how useless it was to talk about this now. The doctor came in just 
then. He was surprised at his patient’s animation. 
</p>
<p>
“He is exciting himself about something,” he said; “is there anything upon his mind?” 
</p>
<p>
“He is wanting to make up a marriage,” replied Mason, in a low voice, “between Miss Helen,”—by which 
name she had been told always to address me—” and her cousin Colonel Davenant. It was always intended 
in the family.”
</p>
<p>
“You wish your daughter to marry her cousin Colonel Davenant?” asked the doctor, bending down over the 
sick man. Sir Harry nodded his head several times.
</p>
<p>
“Say that you are quite ready to do so,” whispered the doctor, in my ear, “and then he will become easier 
in his mind.”
</p>
<p>
I shrank away, instinctively, from the bed-side. “How can I possibly make the promise, <em>now ?</em>” I 
murmured, bursting into tears. 
</p>
<p>
“Promise him this,” entreated the doctor; “should he recover, he will forget all about it.” 
</p>
<p>
I looked towards the bed, not knowing what to do. Sir Harry’s eyes were fixed upon me with an expression, 
as I fancied, of almost fierce command. I quailed beneath their glance. 
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes,” I faltered. “I promise! I promise that I will marry Courtenay Davenant some day.”
</p>
<p>
My father sank back upon his pillow as though intensely relieved. Three days afterwards he passed 
peacefully away, without having ever spoken intelligibly again.
</p>
<p>
Miss Warden and the doctor used every persuasion to prevent me from looking upon him after death, 
dreading the effect which might he produced upon me by so solemn a sight. I persisted, however, 
in my entreaties to be allowed to see him once more, and felt glad afterwards that I had done so. 
I observed upon the calm and peaceful face, whence all strife and bitterness seemed to have departed 
for ever, an expression which recalled the genial, kind-hearted, Sir Harry Davenant of the old time. 
I could believe, as I looked at him, that the man who lay there in the sleep of death was the same 
tender and indulgent father who used to play with me, and take me upon his knee, in the days of my 
departed childhood, before the cloud which had grown out of his sorrow had obscured all that was bright 
and affectionate in his nature, and I felt that my recollection of him would be far less painful to me, 
in the future, from having looked upon him thus for the last time.
</p>
<p>
Before evening Miss Warden telegraphed to the family solicitor—Mr. Corbyn, by name—apprising him of 
Sir Harry’s decease, asking for instructions, and begging him to communicate the news, at once, to 
Colonel Davenant, about whose present address we were uncertain.
</p>
<p>
The lawyer’s reply arrived upon the following day. Sir Harry’s body was to be conveyed to England for 
interment in the family vault. Colonel Davenant—who happended just now to be in London—would attend 
the funeral. My father’s will was in the possession of his solicitors. I was to search, however, amongst 
the papers which he had taken with him abroad to see whether he had left any additional wishes in writing. 
</p>
<p>
Acting upon these instructions I took the black leather dispatch-box—the only receptacle for private papers 
which Sir Harry had brought with him—into my bedroom, and began my search. I hoped to find here some 
memorial of my dead mother—a carefully treasured letter, perhaps; a ring; a flower; or a ribband which she 
might once have worn; something which would give me a truer insight regarding my father’s heart than had 
been afforded by his strange behaviour ever since her decease. I possessed only two letters—quite short ones—
in my mother’s handwriting, which had been given me by Mason, and which I looked upon as my most precious 
treasures. They had been written by my mother when I was only two years old, and when she must have been 
absent from Northover for a few days upon a visit. Every line in these two letters breathed the tenderest 
maternal solicitude, and I was never tired of reading them over. The handwriting was beautiful, though 
somewhat peculiar. I had taken it as a model for my own, and had succeeded, by dint of patient efforts 
at imitation, helped, it may be, by some inherited tendency, in writing almost exactly like her. It was 
upon some scrap of this characteristic handwriting that I was hoping to light now. Another letter, perhaps, 
which I might cherish with my other two treasures.
</p>
<p>
Alas, I found nothing that could comfort me in my desolation! I came, however, upon a very mysterious 
letter, written, apparently, shortly after my mother’s death; after reading which I became a prey to the 
most agitating conjectures. It was written in French, a language in which my father had never been very 
proficient, and in order, I suppose, to make quite sure of its meaning, he had scribbled a rough 
translation—probably with the aid of a dictionary—upon the blank side of the paper upon which the 
letter was written. I give this in Sir Harry’s own words:—
</p>
<div>
<p>
“Sir,<br>
<!-- Above "Sir" is left justified but next line is indented like a normal paragraph -->
“In searching amongst the effects of miladi which you were good enough to give me, I found in the 
pocket of one of her morning dresses a letter to the address of a certain individual, which she 
must, probably, have forgotten to put to the post, having had, no doubt, the intention of doing so 
herself. Afterwards I fell upon two others. Thus I am possessed at this moment of three letters in 
all; and, as they are not letters to leave lying about (<em>à laisser trainer</em>), being somewhat 
compromising to miladi, I venture to apprise you, sir, of my discovery; and I wish to say that if you 
will have the obligingness to send me quite a small present—say fifty pounds sterling—I will lose 
no time in forwarding the letters to your address, so that there should be no fear of the slightest 
scandal. I hope, sir, you will not accuse me of extortion (<em>chantage</em>), because I have dared 
to put a price upon this little service. Believe me, it is not for myself that I desire to amass 
money: but I have a poor old mother who looked well after me when I was a little child, and now that 
she is ‘<em>en plein radotage,</em>‘ it is for her that I make my economies, so that she may want 
for nothing at the house of the doctor with whom I have placed her ‘<em>en pension,</em>‘ close to 
<em>Arras</em> in the <em>Pas-de-Calais</em>. I hope, therefore, <em>monsieur</em>, that you will 
have the goodness to honour me with an answer, and I beg you to accept my most respectful salutations.<br>
“Celestine Vigon.”
<!-- Celestine Vigon is right justified and in all caps -->
</p>

<p>
Celestine Vigon was the name of the French maid who had been with my mother at the time of her 
death. As I stood staring at her letter in utter bewilderment, I could recall her perfectly, although 
I had never beheld her since that time. A tall, dark young woman, with fine eyes, and regular, 
though somewhat massive, features. I remembered her long gold earrings; her straight, upright figure; 
her good-natured smile, and even white teeth. This woman, then (I said to myself), was none other 
than Madame Zoubiroff, the person who had been the Countess Dobrowolska’s maid and <em>confidante;</em> 
who had pawned Dr. Bernard’s amulet, and at whose lodging-house in Paris Mr. Marks had taken up his 
abode with the view of tracking out and bringing to justice his brother’s murderer! How did this woman 
come to be in my poor mother’s service? At whose recommendation had she been engaged? What were these 
three “compromising” letters which she asserted that she had discovered amongst her late mistress’s 
things, and for which she demanded the exorbitant sum of fifty pounds?
</p>
<p>
By-and-by a terrible light broke in upon me. Did not Mrs. Marks say that Madame Dobrowolska had placed 
her French maid as a spy in the house of her “English rival”? and did not Mr. Marks suspect that Madame 
Dobrowolska and her creature had had a hand in this English rival’s death? Was my poor mother this 
“English rival”? In whose affections could she ever have sought to rival the Countess? For some time 
my mind was too stunned and confused to admit of my thinking reasonably. Then I set myself to work out, 
as calmly and collectedly as I could, the mystery that confronted me.
</p>
<p>
Miss Warden’s absurd phrase, “the plot is thickening,” recurred to me in spite of myself, as such 
trivialities will recur, sometimes at inappropriate moments. How fond she was of saying this in the 
days when nothing whatever used to happen! The “plot” was certainly “thickening” now, however, 
with a vengeance!

<!-- CHAPTER XVII -->

<p>“ Change here for Kildullen and Carrick, ’Dullen and Carrick,” a porter shouted monotonously as the up-mail steamed into Ratha junction.</p>

<p>A girl in an ill-fitting ulster, her face hidden by a coarse veil, sprang from a third-class carriage, and rushed across to the ticket oflice.</p>

<p>“ Second to Kildullen.” She ran to the other platform, where a dirty train, with red curtains flopping ‘in lieu of blinds, stood waiting. Finding an empty carriage she got in, and stood until, with a dignified snort, the train started. It was in no hurry.</p>

<p>As the landscape began to whirl by, and the pace increased to twenty miles an hour, the girl threw off her ulster and hat and stood revealed as Nancy.</p>

<p>“ Free ! ” she cried excitedly. “ Not seventy miles away, and yet they will never catch me. It’s such a joke.” Yet the joke fell flatly. The dirty cushions showed no appreciation.</p>

<p>She rolled up the ulster and hat, and as they creaked over a bridge flung the bundle out. It fell by the edge of a stream, startling a nibbling sheep.</p>

<p>Then she pulled a tweed cap from her bag, and read aloud the tattered scrap of newspaper which had worked such wonders.</p>

<p>“A lady, moving in best society, would take charge of young lady to go out with her own daughters. Excellent hunting, boating, and cycling. Terms moderate.”</p>

<p>These were the lines which had caught Nancy’s eye, and now her plan had been carried out. She was Miss Annette Barton, an orphan, coming from school at a French convent. She had accepted such high terms that the advertiser had jumped at the solitary answer without many inquiries.</p>

<p>Nancy had never been in France in her life. She might betray herself at any moment. She was too pleased at her success in having cheated Dick to think of anything now.</p>

<p>Things had gone on wheels so far. She had slipped on her disguise in the deserted wood. Running up from the line no one had seemed to notice her at Moye station. Though she felt confident that they would look everywhere for her, she never reasoned out how easily she could be tracked and found. She laughed aloud as she conjured up visions of Dick’s flurry and anger. If she could have seen the reality! Kildullen. Nancy started up, her heart thumping as she stepped out. She was gripped in an agony of nervousness, a hopeless feeling of lost identity. She was nobody for the first time in her life.</p>

<p>The platform was crowded. Kildullen was a big shipping town. A footman came towards her, and she looked at him anxiously, but he passed her and picked up a parcel.</p>

<p>The crowd thinned, and then she saw two girls looking into carriages. They were of uncertain age, not under twenty-seven, both dressed in light coats and skirts, pink.shirts, topped by sailor hats with regimental bands.</p>

<p>Even as she looked they swooped down on her suddenly.</p>

<p>“ Are you Miss Barton .? ”</p>

<p>She bowed, flushing crimson. Words were beyond her. For a moment she hoped they were strangely-dressed upper servants, but the hope died almost before it had life.</p>

<p>“ Ah! thank the Fates!” The elder girl spoke, mincing her words to cover a decided brogue. “I am Loo Murphy, and this is my sister Jenny. We feared you had not come.”</p>

<p>She looked at Nancy with a growing and undisguised dismay. They on their side had pictured a shy schoolgirl, her hair in a pigtail, who would have paid well, and wanted little in return. But Loo’s widening eyes were slowly taking in Nancy’s grey frock and its owner’s face.</p>

<p>The second girl spoke for the first time.</p>

<p>“ Your luggage, Miss Barton. Would you show it to us?”</p>

<p>“ I lost my portmanteau,” Nancy stammered; “my boxes came by goods, I think—I hope.”</p>

<p>Inquiries elicited that there were “three thrunks <!-- sic --> and a wicker case in the Sthore <!-- sic -->,” and giving some orders to a ragged boy they went out, Nancy following blindly.</p>

<p>A high dog-cart, with a big black between the shafts, was waiting. They climbed in and clattered away by the evil-smelling quay.</p>

<p>Nancy sat silent, stunned. The girls were so unlike anybody she knew.</p>

<p>“ The barracks.” Loo pointed to a block of dreary grey buildings. “ So jolly being so near.”</p>

<p>“You live in the town then?” faintly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” Loo caught the dismayed note. “ Quite in the country, half a mile out.”</p>

<p>It seemed a short half mile when, with a skilful turn of her wrist, Loo turned in a narrow gateway. The house was pretty, low, and creeper-covered, but villa was stamped on it, and Nancy, frowning, remembered the flowery descriptions.</p>

<p>The hall-door stood open, and bewildered Nancy was led in, warmly kissed by a fat old lady, and asked countless questions about her journey. When her brain cleared she found herself in a creaking wicker-chair, a tea-cup in her hand.</p>

<p>She felt strangely young and desolate as she stumbled through her answers. It was her first touch of failure. Then she was left alone for a moment, for two men were announced, and the girls flew fussily to give them tea.</p>

<p>She found time then to look round the room. Its bare, badly-stained floor was spread with cheap rugs and unsteady cretonne-covered furniture. But she was principally struck by the ribbons. Bows tied up the cushions, tied up photograph frames, the room was a veritable study in cheap satin ribbon.</p>

<p>“ Mrs. Martyn ! ” announced a servant.</p>

<p>Nancy looked up. Society was certainly not lacking. A tall woman, almost too slight, came in, with great dark eyes flashing in a pale face.</p>

<p>She sat down near Nancy, and the girl felt the subtle sympathy which some women carry with them. She felt less desolate as the new-comer made a rickety chair creak.</p>

<p>“Tea? Yes, thanks; though I fear I am late. I came to return your book.”</p>

<p>Her voice was low, with a ring of sadness in it. She was heavily lined round eyes and mouth. Yet she looked young.</p>

<p>“You are the girl from France?” she said after a pause, turning to Nancy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” wistfully, “I have just come.”</p>

<p>“Ah ! ” A whole scale of expression in the monosyllable. She looked at Nancy curiously. “You are young to be here—to be launched into the dangers of unlimited military society” (with a mischievous smile).</p>

<p>Nancy did not answer. A wave of misery suddenly overwhelmed her. She longed for the oak~panelled library at Moye, for the hush of the old grey house.</p>

<p>“ Home-sick ? ” said the low voice near her. “ Comparing it with this, perhaps? ”</p>

<p>“Do you thought-read ? ” stammered Nancy, amazed.</p>

<p>“I do heaps of curious things.” The pale face was lit into loveliness by a smile. “ I’m going away now. The girls are too absorbed to notice me, and I see poor Mrs. Murphy about to move this way. I think,” pensively, “ I must leave these young women free to entertain you. Come to see me soon. You will be lonely.”</p>

<p>She rose, and, as if by magic, the men remembered how late it was at the moment. A mischievous flash of golden-brown eyes may have pricked their memories. The Murphy girls muttered something to each other, which sounded something like, “ Flirting cat ! ” and “hating Eve Martyn,” then they fell on Nancy again. Nancy was dazed and bewildered, scarcely believing in her own identity. Their common accents, the cheap, tawdry furniture, were all so different from their highly-coloured descriptions of themselves. She escaped to her own room as soon as she could, newly oppressed by a would-be fine dinner, with everything over-cooked, and a dirty table-cloth, flanked by a heavy-footed “girl,” who had to be directed audibly.</p>

<p>Once in her room, and rid of the chattering, officious girls, she flung open the window and leant out, breasting the night. A faint moon lit the gloom, a breeze was stirring the trees—new trees to Nancy, little distorted shapes of thorn and yew. The electric light glared fitfully over the docks, lighting up unlovely factory chimneys. Repentance filled a heart which was aching dully. Surely Dick would be a better fate than life in a town among these people?</p>

<p>If she started back to-morrow! She never once doubted his forgiving her. Then her stubborn self, fought down her misery. She had started, she would go on. Then because her overwrought brain must find relief, she fell to crying softly for Biddy and her home. An hour later, with blistered, cheeks she fell asleep.</p>

<p>And Dick. Dick had laughed the evening out merrily. Yet once or twice his cigar fell from his lips bitten clean through, as his anger rose and mastered him. Deep in his nature, there was a hatred of ridicule, an unmanlike sensitiveness, which he could not subdue. Nancy had meant to fool him from the first. She had acted dishonestly and deceitfully— two things he could not forgive. He was a person to be pointed out, laughed at, or pitied covertly. He would have to face his regiment without the wife he had spoken of.</p>

<p>His schemes for her future, for changing her wild nature gently to something better, rose up and mocked him now. He stood on the steps to see his guests leave, saying good-bye in a tone which forbade any reference to the day, yet with the bitter knowledge that he would be an object to be discussed by them once they were out of earshot.</p>

<p>“ Grey, old chap.” The best man laid his hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake! don’t, Carstairs.” Dick shook off the hand gently. “ I can’t stand pity. The girl has fooled me prettily. Another man might laugh. I cannot. I have an idea, you know, that she will come back in a year or two, sick of her freak. But, no ! She shall take the liberty she has chosen. Only may I be alive when she asks me to forget, and— forgive. You can do one thing for me, Tony. Help me to lie to the regiment. And now, good-night. I am tired.”</p>

<p>“She was very young. She may explain,” Carstairs ventured, half-heartedly.</p>

<p>“I hope she may,” said Dick grimly. “She will find I can repay in full.”</p>

<p>Their footsteps echoed on the oak, through the lonely house. Gleams of white moonlight shot in across the dim hall. Silently the two men gripped hands and parted. Unknowing, Nancy had pierced the weakest point in Dick’s armour, and he swore to himself that he would never forgive.</p>

<p>So ended their wedding-day. So fell the old man’s house of cards, his hopes to do “best for both.” If spirits can come back, and he could wander that night, a grey shadow through the house he loved so well, how bitterly his failure might have touched him.</p>

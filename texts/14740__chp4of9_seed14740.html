<!-- CHAPTER III -->
<p>Audacity is a good horse, though not always the safest. It had proved a useful mount to Kozlóf, and he rode it with reckless confidence to the finish, a finish for which he was unprepared.</p>
    
<p>Its occasion was a grand Court Ball in the Winter Palace, the last before the Carnival, which he had to attend officially as the A.D.C. on ‘Welcome’ duty.</p>
    
<p>He had mounted that glittering staircase with all his old obtrusively guaranteed distinction, and traversed the gaudy splendours in white and gold of the reception-room—lustrous with the gleam of silk skirts and gilded scabbards, and sparkling with tassel-gold and diamonds—as truculent, supercilious and obtrusive as ever, and not noting the blue sky of his fortune enough to commend it, when the bolt fell. It was hurled by Jove’s own hand, and he was sufficiently near to hear it fulminate</p>.

<p>“What is that fellow doing here?” asked the Emperor of his Adjutant. “Must he be <em>told</em> he has disgraced himself? Order him to strip those epaulets from his shoulders at once and for ever!”</p>
    
<p>The Minister might have explained that the War Office notification on the subject had only been issued that morning, but he walked across the room in silence, and gave the message to the wretched man—who glared with venomous eyes at his Sovereign—adding, as the other turned, white and vengeful, to the door way:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you fight, you fool, while you had the chance?”</p>

<p>Certainly the morality of honour and side arms is of a curious incumbency.</p>

<p>The wild clang of a mazúrka burst out behind him as Kozlóf went forth into the frozen night, sick with anger and despair.</p>
    
<p>The vast iron brazier, blazing before the palace, round which the isvóschiks thronged, flung wild shadows across the snow, and smeared with fitful carmine the pillared front, reddening even the electric mist of light about its walls.</p>

<p>He stepped into his troika, and gave the word for home; but as the runners slid on to the Quai, he changed his mind and their direction.</p>

<p>The address he substituted was that of Madame Lutsk, perhaps under the impulse, a very common one, to spread his misfortune on other people’s bread. Probably he called it a compliment to her constancy, but condemned men are not particular to pay a compliment unless their manners are fine.</p>

<p>Arrived at the merchant’s house, he learnt that its owner was playing ‘vint,’ and that Madame had retired.</p>

<p>That was of no consequence, said the Count; he would wait in the salon while her maid awoke her. It was a matter of importance.</p>

<p>Some one was found to light a few tapers in the gilded reception-room, leaving its further end in darkness where the stove cracked faintly as it cooled, and a cricket chirruped intermittently near the ornamental fire-place. Kozlóf rubbed his toe to and fro to erase the sound. He found it a fresh infliction.</p>

<p>Then the far door swung open, and Vara stood before him with a cry full of quick fear and love.</p>
    
<p>“I suppose you were asleep,” he said, almost contemptuously; as though to be asleep at such a crisis came very near a crime.</p>

<p>“No,” she panted. “What is it, Boris?”</p>
    
<p>She had been asleep and knew not why she denied it; it seemed simpler, that was all. She had leapt from bed and hurried down to him, wrapping a great fur cloak about her as she went. He caught a glimpse of her naked foot above the crimson feathers of her shoe.</p>

<p>“I’m going,” he jerked out.</p>

<p>“Where?” she breathed.</p>
    
<p>He jerked his head upwards, raising his eyes. Modesty might have left that decision to another, but such payment of <em>post-mortem</em> honours to his soul was in the man’s character.</p>
    
<p>The woman who heard him was not humorously inclined. “Boris!” she cried, clutching suddenly at him, as though she at least could not spare him to heaven.</p>

<p>Her action flung open the sable cloak to her feet, and the man looked bitterly at the white silk smock in which she slept.</p>

<p>He could have screamed with empty rage; for life touched him closely at that moment, and death was at the other elbow.</p>

<p>His mistress drew the furs together across her breast, but kept one hand still upon his arm, imploring him to tell her everything.</p>

<p>The request was needless, since Kozlóf had no desire to strain his trouble for her ears; and told his story with an affected indifference to life which hurt the more by its implied indifference to herself.</p>

<p>She leapt at once, womanlike, at the idol of honour, and was for dashing it to the ground. Or, if he could no longer live in Russia, let them leave it together. She could raise money, she had her jewels, they could live quietly on those alone; and her husband would allow her something. He would behave handsomely, she told herself, considering the distinguished character of her elopement. Her widowed mother also might contribute.</p>
    
<p>Anyway, life was better than death ; and better, ah, so much, when life was love.</p>
    
<p>She pressed herself against him; pushed her slippered foot between his, looking up anxiously into his eyes.</p>

<p>Poor thing! she did not know that he had come there with his adieux, not because he loved her, but because he loved himself.</p>

<p>He smiled sourly, holding her from him, and reasserting the claims of honour in a hollow voice. His folly had closed to him all the avenues of pleasure of which he could conceive. In that plight, he assured himself, a man had better die. If so, and he call the necessity honour, the salve to his exit is a cheap one ; one may allow it—to the self-condemned.</p>

<p>But Vara Lutsk would not allow it; neither the necessity nor the salve. Love never will.</p>

<p>The scene was oppressive. She wailing, upbraiding, imploring. He cold, indifferent, and resolved. Indeed, he relished so much this infection of another with his pain that he began to hate the sobbing thing that clung to him, because she could not bear it all.</p>

<p>Then, with the sense of failure overwhelming her, she flung herself back from him, confronting him with strained eyes, her fingers clutching the borders of her cloak.</p>

<p>“Will you do nothing for me?” she cried; “though I have given you all, all!”</p>

<p>As she spoke she threw back her arms convulsively, standing unabashed before him in the soft white robe, which made the passionate surrender of her beauty seem almost chaste.</p>

<p>He replied with some formal platitude which sounded basely contemptible beside that supreme abandonment; and she cast herself desperately upon the floor, with her arms flung out about her face.</p>

<p>He left her there with an expressive “Ugh!” as he slammed the door and clattered down to his sleigh. This time he went home.</p>
    
<p>The man on whose candour this part of the story rests, and who lifted the scarcely conscious woman from the floor, was her husband.</p>

<p>There was a delightful Russian naiveté in his unaltered affection for her after having overheard her confession. There is something finely philosophic in this adaptation of a man’s attitude towards other women to the aberrations of his wife. It is a consistency creditable and confined to the Slav intelligence, which in moral matters is no hypocrite.</p>

<p>He had fallen asleep in the further corner of the room, unobserved of the servant who had put out and re-lit the candles, and had only been awakened by his wife’s entrance. He lay there, listening to what passed, feeling he had no hand in the game, and secure in his large tolerance from the qualms of an eavesdropper.</p>

<p>Kozlóf meanwhile had reached his handsome suite of rooms, which looked out over the wide whiteness of the Field of Mars; crowded now with the furniture of carnival for the morrow—snow-hills, roundabouts, swings, booths, stalls, tiny theatres. The place seemed full of dark contrivances under a moon-washed sky of clouds. Upon a tall pole swayed a flare of naphtha, and figures slung below it were at work, the lean shadow of the mast dodging wildly, hither and thither, across the snow.</p>

<p>Kozlóf could hear the fleck and flick of axes on nail and wood. Then the sounds ceased; the flare was lowered swinging from hand to hand, and smothered suddenly in the snow; the group of workmen, whose strange black shapes had hung around the pole, became grey shadows that defiled slowly across the drill ground.</p>

<p>Kozlóf was left alone, possibly to the memories which the parade ground fostered. In the winter garden behind it he had played as a child among the noseless statues of gods and goddesses—marble shapes of mortal men and women with immortally shameless ways; and later, often during the great reviews he had ridden in furious haste across that field of war, while the squadroned Cossacks, charging down it, stopped thunderously in a whirlwind of dust and steel, a lance-length from his breast.</p>

<p>And now all that pulsing story was to be ended by a bullet’s black note of exclamation in his brain.</p>

<p>He turned from the window, but what followed one can only gather from his valet’s terrified assertions and the evidence of his room.</p>

<p>The man heard him striding to and fro for about an hour—it was probably less. Then came an oath, a sudden halt, and he seemed to be staggering here and there amid the furniture. Finally, a rending clash, followed instantly by another, and the crashing downfall of glass.</p>

<p>He must have torn off his epaulets in a frenzy, flinging himself about the room, and afterwards have hurled them through the long mirrors on the northern wall, one splintering the whole sheet of glass and ripping it from the wall, the other remaining perched high up, amid the fragments of a second on a glittering needle.</p>

<p>Then his valet heard the door open, and, through a chink of that behind which he stood, saw his master, his defaced tunic all awry, and muttering like a madman, plunge, with drawn sword and a revolver, down the stairs. But a minute after he came back, creeping and casting fearful glances behind him, as though in a terror of pursuit.</p>

<p>He slammed the door furiously as he re-entered his room. There was dead silence for some seconds, then an awful scream, and, close upon it, quick together two pistol shots.</p>
    
<p>On his desk was what seemed to have been intended for a statement of his affairs, but only three lines were written, and those smeared with ink. His palm, on which the stain remained, had been drawn across them, as though he had suddenly recognised with malignant bitterness the right of indifference to his fame.</p>

<p>He lay in his blood till morning, the nozzle of the revolver in his windpipe and his throat blown away, but the secondary report of that discharge was soon heard throughout the city, and with general acclamation. It was an affair of honour, honour had been outraged, honour was satisfied. Poor honour!</p>

<p>Pretty lips, which might presumably have pleaded for a man’s life, told of its close with complete satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I think he has come out of it very well,” said one dainty enthusiast. “So many men don’t, you know.” They do not.</p>

<p>On the morning after Kozlóf’s exit, at the first light of day, Suslikof and Svedérsky met, by the Emperor’s command, in a wood not an hour’s drive from St. Isaac’s.</p>

<p>As Prince P., who occupied an official position in the affair, intimated that any one whom it amused must explain the humour to him, and as the Prince is a man of his word, an excellent shot, and not humorously inclined, an appreciation of the jest was not forced upon him.</p>

<p>The combatants started at twenty paces, and advanced to twelve, firing three shots. Svedérsky—who, two days before, had been found guilty by his regimental Court of Enquiry of ‘conduct unbecoming an officer,’ and who had, in consequence, no possible future—requested that the firing might be kept up until some one was destroyed. But the seconds considered that all the more serious claims of honour could be settled with half the chambers of a revolver at no greater distance than a girl might throw her scarf.</p>

<p>It is reported that they were, and by Prince P., so the matter is disposed of; but neither combatant was wounded.</p>
    
<p>That was the end. Svedérsky took a voyage across the world in search of health and oblivion. Súslikof was transferred to another station, and their place, in the completest sense, knows them no more.</p>
    
<p>A fitting epilogue to the whole comedy was spoken over the suicide’s body.</p>

<p>Military honours had been refused it, by express order of the Emperor as head of the army, because he was slain by his own hand; but religious honours, though prohibited by law to all who come to such an end, were commanded by personal order of the Emperor as head of the Church, ‘because some consideration must be shown to the piety of his heart-broken mother.’</p>
    
<p>“Poor old Kozlóf!” exclaimed a comrade, lolling back from the mess-table. “I wonder, supposing he’s that little dicky-bird out there, if he cares a kopek whether they blow off a gun over him or a psalm.”</p>

<p>An article in the next number of a military journal, to prove the necessity of duelling to the commissioned officers of a Christian nation, and written, anonymously, by the Grand Duke Vladimir, the Emperor’s brother, brought down the curtain.</p>
    
<p>It was an instructive play.</p>

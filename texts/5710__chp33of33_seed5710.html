<title>Chapter 33 of THAT LADY LYNWAY by ANONYMOUS</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- L'ENVOL -->
<p>
A ball at Battersea House; one of those great gatherings at which “everybody” is present. Men who are too old to go out, men who are too busy to find time for frivolity, statesman and dandy, guardsman and millionaire, throng up the red cloth which decks the steps of the great portion.
</p>
<p>
And the duchess, how pale and grand and gracious she looks! That’s her daughter over there — Lady Ermingarde — dancing with Colonel Sir Gerald de Bauche. I don’t think her grace quite likes ‘Ermy,’ to be on such evidently friendly terms with the gallant colonel.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Courtenay, looking lovely, beaming with delight, has just quitted the arm of Royalty, and with a slight flush on her pretty face — due to the valse which His Royal Highness has so thoroughly enjoyed — crosses to where Louey Desmond is sitting beneath the shade of a huge bronze and gilt candelabra. Louey has been away for the last year, travelling with her husband in America.
</p>
<p>
“You look charming,” murmurs Louey — they were friends again now — these two.
</p>
<p>
“Simmons’ of course,” she went on, alluding to Mrs. Courtenay’s beautiful dress.
</p>
<p>
“Why, you dear old goose!” answers Bee, “don’t you know Mrs. Simmons has been gone ever so long retired from the business — married. Oh! yes, really married — a man Arty knew — a Mr. Mackinnon, a sort of gentleman, my dear!
</p>
<p>
“Our dance, Mrs. Courtenay,” interrupts the soft voice of a good-looking young man, the newly appointed Under Secretary of Australia.
</p>
<p>
“No! I’m too tired,” says Beatrice; then, noticing the disappointed look which crosses his face, “but you may take me to have some supper if you like, Lord St. Cricketts!”
</p>
<p>
He offers his arm, and they prepare to thread their way through the crowd.
</p>
<p>
“Stop,” exclaims Mrs. Courtenay, “I want to say one word to Lady Amersham first.”
</p>
<p>
“Lady Amersham — let me see.”
</p>
<p>
“There she is over there — sitting by the Duchess of Summerside.”
</p>
<p>
“To be sure — Mrs. Harcourt — I forgot he’d come into the property.”
</p>
<p>
“You forgot everything except your wicked ways,” laughed Bee; “his uncle’s been dead quite six months.”
</p>
<p>
Then she whispered a few words to Violet. Very happy and smiling and pretty, looks the new Countess of Amersham, in all the glory of old diamonds newly set. Her husband has sold his race-horses — they say — and taken to keeping hounds, a much healthier amusement evidently, as one may see by the ruddy glow on his once pale cheeks.
</p>
<p>
Lord St. Cricketts and Mrs. Courtenay reach the supper-room at last, and seat themselves at one of the numerous round tables which dot its ample floor. They seem on excellent — even intimate terms.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve heard my cousing Lord Lynway’s married again?” asks Bee, after some soup and a cutlet.
</p>
<p>
St. Cricketts nods assent.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me the truth about the — woman. You can tell <em>me</em> of course!”
</p>
<p>
“Who? Baby Cecil — why you must have seen her a score of times in the Park; pretty little woman — used to ride a grey horse; don’t you remember?”
</p>
<p>
“What! that creature?” cries Mrs. Courtenay; “upon my word I didn’t think Herbert would be such a fool at his age as to be taken in a second time.”
</p>
<p>
“Come, come,” puts in her companion, “the first Lady Lynway wasn’t as bad as the Baby, anyhow!”
</p>
<p>
“Wasn’t she,” said Bee, “why I could tell you —” and here a score of the old stories rose to Mrs. Courtenany’s lips, but they are cut short by a whisper from Lord St. Cricketts.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s your husband,” he says; “quick, tell me when I am to come to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, the usual time,” she replies. “Arty’s on a committee.”
</p>
<p>
Arty comes up; he is member for his county now, and looks stout and prosperous, as he becomes a large landed proprietor.
</p>
<p>
He lays a hand on his wife’s shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“What secrets are you talking with St. Cricketts?” he asks with the usual fat chuckle.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! no secrets, Arty dear,” says Mrs. Courtenay, looking lovingly at her husband. “We were only talking about <em>that Lady Lynway</em>.”

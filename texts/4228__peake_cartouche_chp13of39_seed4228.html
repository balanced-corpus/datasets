<p>When Cartouche arose from the table, and had pocketed his money, he went to a side-board and drank a goblet of wine ; Count Conconnas, the younger, followed him thither, and said to him in an under tone, “Monsieur Mungo, have I not had the pleasure of meeting you before ?”</p>

<p>Cartouche was momentarily disconcerted, but answered, “How long is it, sir, since you were at Mauritius?”</p>

<p>The Count, with a tact for which Louis Dominique would not have given him credit, replied, “Oh, it is some years since ; I merely went over to the island to endeavour to recover a sum of money that was due to me.”</p>

<p>“Indeed !” said Monsieur Mungo, “I hope you got it.”</p>

<p>“I regret to say I did not,” continued Count Conconnas.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Monsieur Mungo, “I was acquainted with every person of note at Mauritius ; pray, what was your debtor’s name ?”</p>

<p>“Will you permit me to whisper it to you ?” said the Count.</p>

<p>“By all means.”</p>

<p>Count Conconnas placed his mouth to the tawney ear of Monsieur Mungo, and softly uttered, “His name was—Louis Dominique Cartouche.”</p>

<p>“Cartouche !” echoed Monsieur Mungo, “you don’t say so ?”</p>

<p>“The fact is,” said Conconnas, “this gaming-table has been my ruin ; a cursed run of ill-luck has swallowed all my ready capital. The hundred crowns that have been due to me for several years, could I get them repaid, would be of the last importance to me at this moment.”</p>

<p>Cartouche glanced keenly at the Count, and said, “Supposing I were to advance the hundred crowns for the person you name ?”</p>

<p>“I would acquit him of all blame, and be as much his friend as ever,” replied Conconnas. “I cannot very well leave this room without the money, so help me if you can ; I have seen you win a large sum.”</p>

<p>“Do we thoroughly understand each other ?” whispered Cartouche to his school-fellow.</p>

<p>“I pledge you my honour,” replied the Count, “that the secret of which I am in possession shall be inviolate ; and, moreover, that I will endeavour to aid you in every way in my power.”</p>

<p>“Come behind this screen,” said Cartouche ; “there is not any necessity that Monsieur Mungo should be seen publicly paying the debt of a <em>stranger.</em>”</p>

<p>The Count followed, and Cartouche handed the hundred crowns over to him.</p>

<p>“Do you remember the flogging I endured for you ?” asked Louis Dominique.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget your courageous interference,” replied Conconnas.</p>

<p>Here was another instance of the demoralising principle of gaming : A young nobleman recognising a notorious criminal, condescending in a humiliating manner to receive money— which certainly was due to him—the consequences of play reducing him to the meanness of resuming the acquaintance of a publicly-sought felon. Nay, the Count stooped still lower, for rushing again to the table, he speedily lost the hundred crowns ; and was then compelled to beg of Cartouche the sum for which he was distressed —a loan from one of the liveried attendants of the gambling-house, and which he now repaid, wdth a liberal <em>douceur</em> for its use.</p>

<p>Inigo commenced his tirade against some “person unknowm,” and he certainly did his best to earn his money from the Marquis de Louvois. We will endeavour to give a few prose lines as a specimen of his style, and we are induced to do so as the effusion produced a very peculiar effect on the prosperity of <em>La Coupe-Gorge</em> and its worthy editors.</p>

<p>This elegant effusion, having been duly eulogised by Thibault au Dé and Cartouche, who both pronounced to be ten degrees beyond perfection, was carried by Inigo to the hotel of the Marquis de Louvois. The nobleman, on
perusing the lines, expressed his entire approbation, but suggested a few trifling additions, which went so far as to attack the characters of the female relatives of whomsoever the abused person might be.</p>

<p>The Marquis, who appeared to be very cautious lest he should commit himself, informed Inigo that he should send the name that he desired to have placed in all the fore-mentioned blanks, in the course of the following day. The Marquis de Louvois, having then an engagement, to meet at the levee of the Duke of Orleans, the identical nobleman, with graciousness and smiles, on whom he intended to affix the vituperation, pointed to the door as a signal for the departure of Inigo.</p>

<p>Inigo, not to be accused of want of diligence, immediately carried the precious manuscript to the secret printing-office in the employ of <em>La CoupeGorge,</em> and the subject matter was duly set up in form.</p>

<p>Cartouche, highly elated with his winnings at the table, proposed that Thibault au Dé, the Chevalier Bavarde de Tromperie, and himself, should make their way to the best <em>restaurant</em> in Paris, and under his auspices, to play a little game of chance. This game consisted entirely in ascertaining which of the erudite editors could stow away the greater number of dishes, or deposit in their cellar departments the most considerable quantity of good wine, to say nothing of <em>liqueurs.</em> In this pastime, these excellent gentlemen were so proficient, that a considerable period passed ere it could be ascertained which could possibly be the winner of the game. After soups, stews, <em>entrémets, rôtis,</em> fish, <em>gibier,</em> confectionery, cheese, and dessert — Cartouche won by half a fowl, forty oysters, and all the fruit that was left on the table by these atrocious <em>gourmands.</em> </p>

<p>On the following day, the editors did not arrive till late at the office of <em>La Coupe-Gorge,</em> and they patiently awaited the communication of the Marquis de Louvois, as it was a settled affair that the fore-mentioned fine eulogy on character should appear in the next number of the gazette. Irritable in stomach, from the enormous eating and drinking of the preceding night, Cartouche, Inigo, and Thibault au Dé, required what is termed by <em>bons vivants,</em> “a hair of the same dog ;” so they again adjourned to the tavern, when, after drinking freely, they went to their accustomed seats at the gaming-table, and commenced by winning every main. They all three became so absorbed, that for a time they totally forgot <em>La Coupe-Gorge,</em> and everything connected with it; Thibault au Dé, however, coming to his recollection, could not find it in his heart to quit the table; and as Inigo and Cartouche were both winning, they decided that it would be a sin and shame to set their faces against such a glorious run of good luck ; so they agreed to despatch Monsieur Bavarde de Tromperie to the office, giving him a discretionary power to open any communication, and to insert in the blanks, the name sent by the Marquis de Louvois. These directions were given in the heat of the game, and were so frequently interrupted by the rattling of the dice, and the excited feelings of the successful gamblers, that Bavarde de Tromperie, who had also taken more wine than prudence would have recommended, did not quite clearly comprehend his errand. With the innate modesty which appertained to his character as a gentleman, he undertook the task; and jauntingly quitting the gaming-house, walked towards <em>La Coupe-Gorge</em> office. In his road thither, he met a nymph of his acquaintance, who insisted that he should treat her to some ices and <em>liqueurs</em> ; his gallantry would not permit a refusal, and at the coffeehouse to which they retired, he added to the heated state of his brain by a plentiful dose of <em>eau de vie.</em> Parting affectionately from the damsel, he went to the office, where he beheld a heap of letters on the editorial table. The printer’s devil was waiting for orders, and for the correction of the proof-sheet of the libellous effusion.</p>

<p>Monsieur Bavarde de Tromperie commenced opening all the letters with an air of infinite importance, and after glancing at the contents, threw them on the table. At length the devil ventured to tell him that the time was very short before the gazette must be printed off, and that his master was waiting for a name by which the blanks were to be filled up. Bavarde de Tromperie was now rather perplexed, and began again to overhaul the perplexity of papers, when a card met his eye, on which was inscribed, “THE MARQUIS DE LOUVOIS.”</p>

<p>He recollected that Thibault au Dé had mentioned that name (and De Tromperie was not in the secret), so he, without any further reflection, wrote into every one of the spaces, “<em>The Marquis de Louvois,</em> and dispatched the boy with it to the printer’s.</p>

<p>Judge, then, the astonishment, the horror, on the following day, of the nobleman and his relatives —the surprise of all the <em>café</em> loungers in Paris — the bitter vexation of Inigo, Cartouche, and Thibault au Dé, when they thus perused the article in <em>La Coupe-Gorge</em> !</p>

<hr> <!-- next paragraph is in all caps and centered in the original text. -->

<p>“ON THE MOST UNPRINCIPLED OF HUMAN BEINGS.”</p>

<p>“The contemptible wretch we are about to describe was born under the influence of an evil planet.</p>

<p>“The <em>Marquis de Louvois</em> has the temerity to think that he possesses genius ; but, if that be the case, it fully proves to the public it is not impossible that a man may be endowed with great genius, and yet be a consummate fool at the same time.</p>

<p>“The <em>Marquis de Louvois</em> makes it his habit to caress those he despises — what dissimulation ! His caresses serve to conceal his contempt. If the <em>Marquis de Louvois</em> is disgusted, he endeavours to hide it under the appearance of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“The <em>Marquis de Louvois</em> has the vanity to fancy that he is admired by the nation : and that he was born to release the world from the manifold errors under which it groans. But who will give credit to the doctrines of an atheist ?</p>

<p>“The <em>Marquis de Louvois,</em> it must be acknowledged, does not possess all the cardinal virtues, for he is revengeful, envious, treacherous, cruel, and addicted to every variety of excess. He is, moreover, a calumniator, bully, and a coward.</p>

<p>“The <em>Marquis de Louvois</em> has been an oppressor of the poor, of the widow, and the orphan. He has been a public marauder on an extensive scale; in short, to sum up all, we have no hesitation in publicly expressing our candid opinion that the <em>Marquis de Louvois</em> would be decided disgrace to the gallows.”</p>

<hr> <!-- extra space between paragraphs in the original text. -->

<p>Then followed gross imputations on the characters of the female relatives, sisters, aunts, and cousins, which completely took all the composure from the mind of the Marquis, accustomed as he was to view the affairs of the world (when they did not interfere with his selfishness)
with <em>nonchalance,</em> or affected serenity.</p>

<p>Here was a most delicious state of afiairs! Had the demon, who it has been supposed put his clawed finger on the whole arrangements of that eventful evening, determined to do his most damnable, his <em>excellency</em> could not have effected a more perfect discomfiture to the confederated seoundrels.</p>

<p>First — Although the beginning of the evening was greatly to the advantage of Inigo, Cartouche, and Thibault au Dé, the mad fools could not stop. If they could have walked from the tables — if they could but have invested the money they had won —if they could but have retired into obscurity, and have endeavoured, by their future lives, to have atoned for their past peccadilloes —but, no, it was not in the nature of the beasts !</p>

<p>The bank of the gaming-table was on the point of being broke for the night—the house would close at one o’clock : when these three reckless rascals, not content with gaining a little fortune, chose —insisted, on treble stakes, in the avaricious hope of winning more. We will not
detain our readers with the result at any length —they were all reduced to their last louis d’or.</p>

<p>This position of their affairs was not at all improved by another event. It never rains but it pours; misfortune seldom comes alone! The young Count Duchatelet, son to the Marquis de Groc, had arrived in Paris. The robbery of the diamonds had been discovered; and, as the family jewels were higlily valued, Duchatelet, who, through his own imprudence had been the innocent cause of their loss, to appease his father, and regain his own self-esteem, determined to abandon his hawks, journey to the capital, and set the Parisian police to work to discover the
thief.</p>

<p>The authorities, on the bare mention of diamonds, recollected how extremely fortunate they had been in the discovery of the Queen of Spain’s gems ; so they put their ferrets on the same scent, and the first point was to threaten the two sharping ladies, the sham Countess de Bergerac and her <em>gouvernante,</em> with the torture; but as these fair creatures had a very sensible objection to tight lacing, as being extremely prejudicial to comfort and health, they readily confessed that they had also received two more diamonds (the ring and the <em>agraffe</em>) from the person they supposed to be the Duke de Nivernois, and that they had sold them to old Nicholas Flamel. This, as a matter of course, raised a fresh hue and cry against Louis Dominique Cartouche, who henceforth became yet more popular with the police of Paris.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Louvois had accidentally tumbled into his own pitfall ; and he was pondering as to the course he could possibly pursue, when the whole host of his lady relatives, accompanied by their male family connections, laid siege to the Hotel Louvois, all breathing vengeance against the horrid, the libellous publication, <em>La Coupe-Gorge.</em></p>

<p>The Count was desperately perplexed, but endeavoured at first to laugh the affair off, and to treat it with the contempt it deserved. But this, however it might have suited the purposes of Louvois, did not in the slightest degree satisfy the honour or excited feelings of the ladies : who decided unanimously that whoever the wretch might be who penned the villainous libel, he should end his days in one of the cells in the Bastile, shaped like an inverted cone, wherein the prisoner could never by any possibility either stand, sit, or lie in a natural or easy position.</p>

<p>It was in vain that the wealthy, the voluptuous Marquis de Louvois remonstrated. The females had been seriously calumniated (and even the scoundrel Inigo was not the author of that portion of the libel), and they were up in arms. They were all women of high rank ; and finding, to their utter surprise, that the Marquis de Louvois was exceedingly cold and morbid on the subject, they left his hotel, and ordered their carriages at once to drive to the residence of Monsieur Marc Pierce D’Argenson, the lieu- tenant-general of police, where they obtained an immediate audience, and all ten ladies poured forth their grievances at once. It was the most perplexing case the minister ever had before him.</p>

<p>The result of this formidable attack on Monsieur D’Argenson, was the seizure of the office (and all its contents) of <em>La Coupe-Gorge</em> , of which the wily editors were soon apprised ; and they scuttled off, as rapidly as possible, towards their sanctuary in the Rue Thibault au Dé. Here they were met by Madame au Dé, in a state of hysterical agitation, who alarmed them by the intelligence that the officers of police were in possession of their snug and convenient retreat, of all the costly purloined furniture ; in short, everything, even to her lute and last farthingale, was gone ; and that her advice was, that they should all separate. She embraced Thibault tenderly, and begged, as a favour, that he would keep his neck out of a halter. As the confederates were now aware that they were hotly pursued, it was evident that another place of concealment must be immediately be found. Thibault au Dé asked Madame if she had any small change about her, when she rummaged her pockets, and found a few livres, which she handed to him. She further informed them that Douce Esperance was in custody ; and that their secret apartments could only have been betrayed by
old Mion de Boule, on whose honour she had such reliance that she was certain that if she had not been placed on the rack, like a flitch of bacon, she would not have <em>split.</em> They parted. It was a melancholy termination to their prosperity. Indeed, it was so affecting that we must beg a small respite in our narrative, and pass over eight or ten days.</p>

<hr> <!-- extra space between paragraphs in the original text. -->

<p>We are now gazing at the <em>porte cochere</em> of a large, ramshackling, ricketty, ancient, house in the <em>Rue des Petits Oiseaux,</em> in whlch reside, temporarily, three persons of great distinction in their peculiar walks of life. These gentlemen are in a state of exaltation, for they dwell in the <em>mansarde.</em> In this apartment (of six pair) the first floor down the chimney, the ceiling formed an isosceles triangle to accommodate the roof, and in the more acute portions thereof, two truckle beds were stowed away ; three broken stools, a short form (not of prayer), a casserole, and a coffee-pot, were included in the residue of the furniture. The hearth boasted of a fire, on which a few sticks still crackled, and around it weref seated three figures of very questionable appearance. One of them was coat-and-waistcoat-less, and luxuriated in one slipper, which he ever and anon changed from foot to foot, as the pedal extremity became chilled. His hair was dishevelled —his whole appearance was <em>distrait</em> and destitute. He thrust his hands near the embers, rubbed them, rose up, walked a step or two, knit his brows, shivered, swore, and then sat down again ; this was Cartouche. Fate had almost done its worst with him ; he was, to use a vulgar expression, completely “cleaned out,” and so were his companions, Inigo and Thibault au Dé. The latter worthy muttered curses on all croupiers from the time of Dyonisius of Syracuse (the first player at pitch and toss) downwards.</p>

<p>It was, at all events, something consolatory that the <em>Mont de Piété</em> of that day had proved itself a resource in the hour of need ; various articles of the wearing apparel of each of the gentlemen having been completely transformed into something else. The hat of Cartouche had been for some time changed into a scrag of mutton, the laced cravat of Thibault au Dé was turned into a quarter of a yard of tripe, and the
pair of green spectacles of Inigo had resolved themselves into half a dozen cabbages.</p>

<p>Altogether the trio formed a picture worthy of examination. Here were three great men—witty, full of talent and resources, diplomatists of the highest order —reduced to the necessity of dining upon nothing! Truth to say, the energies of Cartouche were for once paralysed ; good cheer and warmth, and a little of “the ready” in possession, were the necessary aliments on which the excited —particularly the excited to ill deeds —live and thrive.</p>

<p>A thief stripped of his finery, and starving, is already within an inch of the gallows! Such was the thought that flashed across the mind of Cartouche as he ground his teeth together, which ornaments to his mouth were in the actual enjoyment of a sinecure.</p>

<p>Hunger was gnawing the internals of the three ex-editors. Cartouche seized the coffee-pot, in which he recollected he had left some coffee, and he placed it on the embers in the hope of giving it a gentle boil up. He then endeavoured to fan up the fire with his slipper ; having succeeded in raising a faint flame, he was gratified to observe that his beverage stewed gently. Reaching a cup without a handle he began the operation of pouring out his coffee, but something in the spout obstructed the passage ; he was induced to examine closely for the
cause, when a thin twine emerged from the spout ; in pulling this out, it proved to be the tail of a starved mouse, which had unfortunately met a watery grave (tinctured with the fragrant berry) in the pot. Empty as he was, and craving for nourishment, his stomach revolted.</p>

<p>Inigo made an attempt at a rally ; “This line of conduct can be pursued no longer,” said he ; “starvation is a worse death than hanging, if the worst comes to the worst ! A thought strikes me,” continued he, “the cemetery of St. Medard has not had a miracle for the last twelve months.”</p>

<p>“And what is that to us ?” grumbled out Thibault au Dé, whose internals rumbled like distant thunder, from positive vacuity.</p>

<p>“What is in the wind now ?” said Cartouche, elated with hungry hope, for he had confidence in Inigo’s talents.</p>

<p>“In my younger days,” replied Inigo ; “I have told you I was celebrated as a Scaramouch, and up to this time retain the ability to throw myself into any imaginable position, If you, gentlemen, have no objection, I will rehearse my part.” So saying, he dragged the straw mattress into the centre of the room, and there he went through all the motions of the lame, halting, miserable supplicant gradually divested of his
infirmities, and finally bounding about like an antelope.</p>

<p>The spirits of Cartouche were considerably raised by this exhibition ; and Inigo felt so much encouraged that after having arrayed himself as a beggar — which, by the way, gave him very little trouble — and marking his face with charcoal and soot, he set out to perform in earnest.</p>

<p>With this view, he made his way through the streets in the direction of the cemetery of St. Medard, where approaching a tomb that stood near the footpath of the chapel, he, with great apparent difficulty, crawled to the top of it ; there he howled, groaned, and grimaced, and thus speedily enlisted the compassion of all the passers-by, who threw him copper coin in abundance ; one old lady in the sad coloured habit of a devotee, and holding in her hand a string of beads almost as large as a rope of onions, distanced her compeers in charity by the bestowal of a piece of four livres. On receiving this, so loud were the yells of Inigo that the Curé Père Hilarie was attracted to the spot, exclaiming, “<em>Pauvre estropié!</em> descend as thou best may, and I will assist thee from the poor-box.” A crowd of women and ancient persons were assembled as spectators ; and it must be confessed that Inigo acted his part inimitably, for he tumbled from the tomb to the earth. Being raised, he asserted that he could not possibly relate how it could have happened, but he already felt himself considerably better.</p>

<p>“Then thou hast but to come daily,” observed the Père Hilarie, with a benevolent smile, “and with help from above, I will answer for thy ultimate restoration ; nay,” said he, with something that very much resembled a wink, and at the same time giving him a handful of small coin, “thou art thyself well assured of that.”</p>

<p>Inigo looked his thanks and something more, and being put on his legs by some compassionate bystanders, who sincerely hoped that he had not anything catching about him, he limped to the nearest corner, and then, when out of the sight of the spectators, made the best of his way toward the <em>Rue des Petits Oiseaux.</em></p>

<p>Recollecting the situation of his comrades, he stopped and purchased bread, sausages, a <em>gigot de mouton,</em> wine, and brandy, with which he skipped up the six stories’ stairs to the lofty <em>mansarde.</em> Giving a preconcerted signal, he was admitted, and exhibited his treasures to their famished eyes.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha! ha! <em>c’en est fait.</em> Here is the result of the labour of this day, and I have seven days’ work to come still better than this.”</p>

<p>“But how, Inigo ?” cried the two starved thieves at once.</p>

<p>“Eat, ye villains ! eat and drink !” answered Inigo ; “suffice it to say that I have fallen in with a speculator, who coolly calculates the means of employing miracles in the forwarding of his projects.”</p>

<p>The confederates crammed themselves comfortably full.</p>

<p>“ Nought is there under heaven’s wide hollowness,<br>
That moves more dear compassion of mind<br>
Than beauty brought t‘unworthy wretchedness.”<br>
Spencer</p>
</div> 
    
<p>As many of Lord Derwent’s guests were obliged to be in Fredville, horses and grooms were assembled early at the steps of Derwent Castle, awaiting their respective masters. The numerous party whom business, duty, or curiosity called to the neighbouring town, were speedily mounted, and hastened to the performance of their respective offices.</p>
    
<p>Mr. St. Maur having expressed a deep interest in the fate of the young woman for whom all felt so much anxiety, drove in with Lord Derwent to Fredville.</p>
    
<p>Lady Emily allowed the party to precede her; and when she arrived at the prison~gates, all was already in movement. Carriages were hurrying to the court-house, horsemen rapidly crossing the streets, and the idle assembled in different knots to see the pomp of the judge’s arrival at the court-house. The high sheriff’s splendid equipage, the new and gay attire of the javelin men, the noise, and the movement, gave an air of gaiety, a festive character to the scene, little in accordance with the solemn and painful duties so many of those concerned had to perform.</p>

<p>The high sheriff’s party, consisting of ladies elegantly dressed, arrived, and hastened to the little gallery allotted to them above the box of the grand jury.</p>

<p>The court was a beautiful Gothic hall, with railings of oak, and narrow windows, with painted glass sufficient to subdue the glare of light.</p> 
    
<p>The judge entered the great portal, took his seat on the place of judgment; the high sheriff in his place. Lord Derwent and another peer, as members of the highest court of judicature, occupied seats by the judge. On his right hand was the box for the grand jury, and on his left that for the petty jury.</p>
    
<p>Lady Emily would not allow her carriage to draw up till the cortège had passed, and the judge entered. She then drove to the little door, and ascended the steps of the governor’s apartments, where she was permitted to wait in the hope of seeing Isabel; but a true bill had been found against the unhappy creature who was the object of her interest, and as her trial was fixed for that morning, it was thought unadvisable that Lady Emily should now visit her.</p>

<p>The chaplain speedily joined her, and appeared exhausted and distressed. His prison ministrations had been painful and harassing, even beyond their wont ; and he gladly remained with Lady Emily till the trial now going on should be finished, as he intended. accompanying Isabel to the hall of judgment.</p>
    
<p>The address of the judge to the jury was impressive, and showed with what awe he entered on his office.</p>
    
<p>They sat silent for some time, for Lady Emily’s sensations were overpowering. It was for the first time that she was under the roof with and realised the solemn duties now performing. It was the first time she was near to hear offended Justice thunder forth her inexorable decrees; and the bars, and the chains, and the bolts filled her with mysterious dread, and each approaching footstep made her tremble.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Clements said,—“I have been twice to see the prisoner, Isabel, since your visit, and I regret to say that there is no change in her manner. She evinces no emotion, manifests no fear, and preserves the same inviolable silence. The contrast between her and the rufiians who are now on trial is extraordinary. They were noisy and insolent till the lawyer told them that the evidence against them was complete; and since then their despair has been as ungovernable, varied with the most horrible imprecations against the witnesses and all that belonged to them. When I leave them and go to that beautiful creature, I feel as if I were in heaven. There is such purity and goodness about her whole aspect, that guilty she cannot be.” </p>

<p>As he spoke the governor entered, and told how disgusting was the conduct of the prisoners then on trial. Their deportment was marked by fear and insolence—trembling at their fate, and apparently defying justice. Never were men less pitied for the sentence passed. Hardened in depravity, they had often before been inmates of those gloomy walls. The dark lantern, that lighted them to their midnight plunder—the iron bar, which forced the door of the dwelling they pillaged—the pistol, which was threateningly held over the roughly- awakened owner of the house,—were all there. The frightened child swore to the man who had broken the door of her room,—a short half hour completed the evidence, and the jury returned their verdict without retiring ‘ from the court. Without pity or sympathy, they were reconducted to their cells</p>.

<p>But speedily the hall of justice began to fill, for it was rumoured that the beautiful stranger was the next for trial. The pas- sages were crowded,—the curious mob rushing in by all the portals to the scene of interest.</p>
    
<p>When the jailor unlocked Isabel’s door he found her ready, awaiting the summons. She paused for one moment on the threshold, and he thought her invincible courage had at last failed. He was wrong. He had some difficulty to force his way through the crowd, who at her approach would have sprung on the forms and benches. Called to order, they stood in solemn silence.</p>

<p>Dressed in deep mourning, with a long black scarf, and a bonnet and veil arranged to conceal as much as possible her features from public gaze, the unhappy young creature was conducted to the dock, and placed at that bar where every one expected her inevitable doom would be declared. She walked with a firm step, and with an air which might have been construed into unconcern, had not the death- like pallor of her cheek revealed how much suffering and sorrow she had mastered to preserve that calm and dignified exterior.</p>

<p>As she entered, every eye rested on her—there was that low, undefined murmur—that breathing of applause which is heard when the audience is moved, and the place of gathering too solemn for noisy expression. That beautiful form, and the heavy offence with which
she stood charged, at once rivetted and averted admiration.</p>

<p>Those most accustomed to see the extremity of human woe were touched. There seemed an awe pervading the court, as if some august sufferer were present. The lawyers laid down their briefs, the jury turned towards her, and even the venerable judge fixed on her a look of deep and mixed pity and tenderness. It seemed as if he already feared the dread duty awaiting him.</p>

<p>After a long pause, the clerk of the crown rose and read the indictment—and turning to the prisoner, he said, “Guilty, or not guilty?” She did not answer. The question was repeated. The prisoner raised her head, held firmly by the front of the dock, and said in a clear and audible voice, “Guilty!”</p>

<p>Awe-struck, the whole court was silenced—for some minutes not a word or a breath was heard, The spectators shuddered—professional men consulted in low whispers—“How shall we save her?” seemed the question each heart was earnestly demanding ; terror, dismay, proved how much it had been hoped and expected that she might yet have been proved innocent, and acquitted.</p>

<p>As she stood, while all business was suspended, the rays of the sun poured down upon her from a painted window, and as she lifted up her head, the rich light fell on her. She appeared to be entranced in lofty communion, seeming by the purity of her expression to give the lie to every accusation ; for an instant she seemed like a spirit from another world—</p> 

<div><p>“Or as some soaring bird,<br>
That flags awhile her fluttering wings beneath,<br>
Till she herself for stronger flight can breathe.”</p></div>

<p>Once more the question was put—and her lawyer, hoping she might still assert her innocence, would have spoken. She turned to him, and waived her hand, and her eye for the first time rested on the grand jury box, where every one was intently observing her. For one minute she looked with earnest and absorbing attention—her face convulsed, she uttered a heart-rending shriek, and fell apparently lifeles to the ground—her scream was echoed through the hall of judgment, and the people pressed forward to help and bear away the motionless form. The medical men pushed through the crowd, and gave prompt assistance, and she was borne away to the hospital belonging to the prison—and those whose stern duties kept them to their posts sent frequent missions to know the fate of one whose sorrows had drawn tears from dried and hardened channels.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the pale and insensible form was stretched on a straw pallet, placed on atruckle bedstead. Her bonnet had been removed, and her long hair, unconfined, fell over the low and narrow bed, and touching the ground, waived to and fro by the gentle breeze.</p>

<p>The black drapery was drawn aside, and the red handkerchief which she had always worn in prison was folded across a bosom most exquisitely moulded.</p>

<p>Every restorative was applied, every method tried, every remedy suggested, but without any result—dead she was not, but the surgeon did not anticipate any other result.</p>

<p>The account of all this tragic scene was speedily brought to the room where Lady Emily Somerton and Mr. Clements were sitting, and at her most urgent request, permission was given that she might join the unconscious sufferer. She was conducted along the passage by which some manacled culprit was going to his sentence, and she recoiled from the hideous expression which vice had traced.</p>

<p>Winding their way up a long staircase, they came to the room where Isabel was lying.</p> 

<p>Lady Emily then, for the first time, saw her in the broad light of day. She stood at the foot of her bed transfixed, for she had never seen such perfect beauty. Silently she watched the busied nurses coming and going, while all stood round in perfect impotence; for the marble form seemed neither to breathe nor feel. Presently the physician entered, and bid them open a vein; but the blood hardly flowed.</p> 

<p>“Surely,” said Lady Emily, in a low voice to Mr. Clements, “it is better to let the spirit go. Why recal it to ignominy and suffering? Her life is already forfeited; the law is avenged; let God’s gentle summons suffice to fulfil the law’s behest. She dies for her crime; for surely anguish has killed her!</p>

<p>Turning to the surgeon, she would have stayed his hand—but in vain. She then approached and knelt down by Isabel’s pillow, and bent over with such a pitying spirit, that it seemed almost as if she communed with her, and asked her her grief and her sorrow.</p> 

<p>Two women, patients in a small adjoining ward, crept out and stood and gazed rudely at Isabel. One, old and haggard, exclaimed, “I never see’d any good come to these beauties.” </p>

<p>“It is little you know,” said her companion, “of what happens to beauties.”</p>
    
<p>“So much the better,” exclaimed the old woman, adding many rough and coarse remarks on the poor sufferer’s story; but they were obliged to retire, as the governor of the prison soon entered, accompanied by Mr. St. Maur.</p>

<p>The whole appearance and manner of the latter were strangely changed.</p> 

<p>Pale and agitated, he flew to the side of the apparent corpse, gazed at it fixedly for some moments, and then hastily turningfbegged he might speak to Lady Emily. He hurried into the embrasure of the distant window, and poured forth a torrent of anxious questions; from whence she came?—who she was?—what was her name?—her home?</p>

<p>“Alas!” said Lady Emily, “I know nothing whatever of her history. The heavy accusation under which she stands is all I know of her life.”</p> 

<p>Finding he could not get from her any of the information he needed, he speedily retired as he had entered. During their brief conversation the governor had given orders that no relaxation could be allowed,—every remedy for her recovery was to be strenuously applied.</p>

<p>With much difficulty Lady Emily obtained permission to remain. Hours passed away—still she kept her faithful vigils—and, before the sun declined, slight convulsive movements indicated the return of life.</p>

<p>Believing and hoping that when life flowed again she might, by some unguarded word, reveal the secrets she had so faithfully guarded, and that that word might otherwise fall on the ear of a coarse and mercenary nurse, she watched through the long hours with an unsleeping eye.</p> 

<p>Morning broke, and violent fever, spasm, and convulsion proved the presence of severe illness. Other physicians were summoned, as the case was peculiar and interesting. She had not spoken or opened her eyes,—the brain was declared to be the seat of the disease, and the cause was neither remote nor difficult to find. The trial had been too severe, her frame had given way, and she had sunk under an effort beyond her strength.</p>

<p>The casements of the windows of the long ward were opened, and Lady Emily looked over the distant view spread beneath the windows, with the feelings peculiar to those who have spent their night watching in scenes of sorrow. How the dawn has been desired! What a charm is it to see nature awake!—to hear the first carol of the lark!—to catch the long glances of the rising sun, as they light up object after object of the distant view! When the world is redeemed from darkness, man seems to throw away part of his load or his grief—and seems, as the poet says, to replume himself with the rising day.</p>

<p>Lady Emily saw the morning rays fall on the stately home of her uncle, and the sun glisten on the distant windows where she hoped her children had slept in peace and innocence. She offered a silent tribute of prayer and praise, made so fervent by the contrast of her home with the scenes immediately around her.</p>

<p>When morning light comes the spirit seeks all absent objects of affection,—travelling far, perhaps, and greeting many. So from the prison window Lady Emily sent her wandering spirit to greet one for whose safety and happiness she spent hours of prayer and anxiety,— far away, exposed to danger and death.</p>

<p>She accepted the governor’s kindness, and was going down to breakfast in his apartments when it was announced that her carriage and her maid awaited her ; she had come with positive orders from Lord Derwent that she should return to her home. She felt it was unreasonable to refuse, and arrived as the gong was sounding to re-assemble the inhabitants of the castle to morning prayer.</p> 

<p>Lord Derwent’s bright and youthful daughter was at the door, anxiously awaiting her cousin’s return. She sprung on the carriage-step to greet her. “Dear Emily, what have you been doing all night? We were all so unhappy,—the children crying, papa rather cross, Sir Frederick lecturing. Nobody amused themselves last night,—-we could not dance,— nobody laughed—so we yawned half the evening, and marched to bed to rob Sir Frederick of his <i>jeunesse</i>, which he seemed so intent on instructing. Now you are come home, he won’t bore us any more. But, dear Emily, you look so pale and tired—come to the breakfast-room. But no,—everybody is in the chapel. Come along, or I shall be scolded. We’ll kneel at the door, and get away quietly for you to have some tea, and rest too.” They went hand-in-hand into the chapel, and knelt unobserved. </p>

<p>The service over, all gathered round Lady Emily, anxious to greet her, and curious to know the cause of her most unusual absence.</p>

<p>“Eating before talking,” cried Fanny. “Pack off the babies. Go along, you little plagues,—when your mamma has rested, you shall kiss and bother as much as you like.”</p> 

<p>She boxed their ears, and sent them off crying, and led the van of the party into the gallery,—where she placed her cousin on the sofa in her favourite window, and speedily brought her everything to refresh and restore her exhausted strength.</p>

<p>“Emily,” said Fanny, “What did they do to Mr. St. Maur at the prison? He came home quite changed. They told me that when he saw your prisoner he looked so sad. He had a long private interview, too, with some old man there—the jailer, I think—and when he returned we had no more fun, no more stories; and then, without saying good bye to any one but papa, away he went last night.”</p>

<p>“Gone!” said Lady Emily. “How sorry, how very sorry I am! He looked at that poor thing as if he would have exerted himself for her ; and I wanted to know many particulars about Stanley which I could not learn from him.” </p>
    
<p>Lord Derwent confirmed all Fanny had said, and was himself preoccupied and out of spirits. “Mr. St. Maur’s plans were undecided. I think it probable he may return here for a day or so.”</p>

<p>The gentlemen returned to Fredville, promising to bring to Lady Emily the surgeon’s report of the sufferer she had so tenderly watched. She herself, worn out, retired to her own room. Day after day passed, the assizes were finished, and the judges had left the town. No sentence could be passed on the prisoner Isabel,—she lay in the same condition,—~and when the remedies used had produced their effects, and removed the stupor and oppression of the brain, it became evident that her reason was gone, and it was feared that she would be an incurable lunatic.</p>

<p>Long and severe was the struggle. No moment of light revealed her past history. The red handkerchief was rent in stripes,—-one rolled in her hair, the others tied round her wrists as bracelets; the remnant was twisted up in the form of a doll, and caressed and placed beside her as her baby, with which she was continually occupied in tender but indistinct address.</p>

<p>When an attempt was made to remove the red handkerchief, she betrayed great emotion ; and she sat upon her bed, and placed them all before her, and when strong enough, she would jump up, and walk to and fro, as if soothing the child to rest.</p>

<p>At first she did not notice her frequent visitors; but later she became irritable and unmanageable.</p>
    
<p>Thus the month rolled round; and the medical men became unanimous that she must be removed to the lunatic asylum; for the hospital ward in the prison was quite unsuitable to her position, and made the proper treatment impossible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, though Lady Emily drove frequently to Fredville, the governor positively forbid her seeing Isabel; and, in her gloomy retreat, all access was strictly prohibited.</p> 

<p>As the last hope of gaining some knowledge of the previous history of the unhappy Isabel, Lady Emily resolved on finding where, and with whom, she lodged previous to her imprisonment.</p>

<p>After some difliculty, she discovered the village; which was on the sea shore, many miles distant from Derwent Castle.</p> 

<p>She drove thither with Fanny Evelyn and her own children.</p>
    
<p>The rooms occupied by Isabel were in a small house facing the channel. The flowers on her window-sill were still blooming, and the apartment untenanted.</p> 

<p>The woman who owned the house was willing to answer any question, and welcomed any one interested in the fate of the young woman, for whom she had formed quite an attachment. Shaking her head, “It is useless,” she said; “she never made a friend of me; and I know nothing of her story: we examined the room where she was apprehended, and could find neither letter nor paper. She had a small bag with linen; and had no other gown but the one she wore, which is made of very fine silk.</p>

<p>“She talked of the weather,—of my health, and my husband’s,—but never a word about herself. I never saw her cry till her child was born ; and I have since then heard her scream in agony; but when the little creature died, she wiped up all her tears, and sat, as the doctor said, like a stone or a stoic.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not ask her from whence she came?” said Lady Emily.</p>

<p>“I never ventured,” replied the woman; “there was something about her which prevented any one questioning her. The children were always with her;” and, pointing to a curly-headed little child, playing at the door, “she used often to take that child when she drove out.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Fanny, “I think I have seen her, for I remember that child. One day when we were walking, we met a carriage, and the lady in it stopped the driver, and she got out, and asked whose children those were; and when we said that they were Lady Emily Somerton’s, she kissed them, and said they were like angels ;—-she looked at them a long time, and we all remarked her beauty: was that Isabel?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Miss,” said the poor woman, “it was: she asked me many questions about you all when she came home; and she drove out another day to Derwent Castle; and the child told me she went into the church, and gave the little carriage in charge to a boy standing near.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Fanny, again interrupting, “I know that story well; for Mrs. Jones, the clergyman’s wife, told me about that. A poor woman in the village lost her child, and it was buried that morning.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Jones went to the funeral ; and just as the tolling bell stopped, she told me that a little carriage drew up, and a lady in deep mourning got out, and a child was with her. She stood leaning on a gravestone, and watching them lowering the coffin ; she then fixed her eye on the mother of the baby. </p>

<p>“Mrs. Jones remarked to me afterwards, how intent was her look of pity.</p>

<p>“When every body had left the church, she gave the sexton some money, to allow her to enter; and Mrs. Jones was so struck and interested with her appearance, that she followed her to see why she desired to go in.</p>

<p>“She put the child that accompanied her into a pew, and bid her be still till she returned. She then walked round, and up and down the aisle, stood motionless for some time in the chancel, and then turned to the altar, and knelt slowly down, and sunk her head on her hands: the sexton was tired, she remained so long; but Mrs. Jones held up her finger, and forbid him to interrupt her;—she was, herself, concealed behind the curtain of the organ. At last she rose, and drew out a chaplet of immortelles,—such as I have read they put on the graves of their friends, in foreign countries,—-she hung it on one of the knobs of the communion, rail; and after another long pause, she returned to the child, and re-entered the little carriage. As there was no one with her, Mrs. Jones could not discover who she was.</p>

<p>“Can that be the poor prisoner? how sorry she will be!”</p>

<p>“What did she do all day?” asked Lady Emily.</p>

<p>“She was generally in the open air.”</p>
    
<p>“Did she ever go to church?”</p>

<p>“No, never: when we all went there she generally used to go and sit on the cliff, which was her favourite walk; and she staid there often till very late in the evening.” </p>

<p>“Did the clergyman never visit her?”</p> 

<p>“Yes; but she would not receive him, nor any of the numerous people who, wished from curiosity to visit her. Once when he called I said she was on the cliff; and he followed her. His daughter was with him, and she noticed her very much, and made her a wreath of field flowers, but would not converse with him, or answer his questions. I told him so; for when my children asked her, where is your mother? she pointed up, and said, in heaven;—where are your brothers and sisters? she shook her head;—-where, then, is your father? she said, heaven!—and where is your house and your home? heaven! she said;—so always forbid them to say more;—those answers from children, I said, mean only, I don’t choose to tell, so do not bother the poor thing. She came down the day of my eldest child’s birth-day, and she hung flowers about our room, and little garlands for the children,—she had a wonderful taste.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe she is guilty?” said Lady Emily.</p>

<p>“My husband always says he is sure she is not guilty of that, or anything else that’s wrong. She had a particular love for a baby, and when mine was ill, and cried, she always sent for it, and soon rocked it to sleep for me.”</p>

<p>“Who was her accuser?” asked Lady Emily.</p>

<p>“The doctor,” said the poor woman, going to the window, and putting her apron before her eyes. Recovering herself a little, she turned to her visitors, “We were all sorry she had that man; but it could not be helped. At first she would not have a nurse, but I made her. She was ill a long time, and the woman came down and said, ‘for God’s sake send for a doctor, or she will die,’ and so I ran and fetched Mr. M‘Gregor. I’m sorry I did: he was a dark, hard man; and I told him afterwards, that he must be a brute to give evidence against such a sweet young creature, so out of the way pretty and kind.”</p>

<p>“Can I see the doctor?” said Lady Emily.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,—he is gone; it is said he ran away before the trial; so, after all, she would not have been proved guilty if she had not condemned herself. People say he was sorry, and repented it. We are all glad he’s gone, for the people would almost have pelted him; the boys stoned his windows, and would have followed him, but he escaped at night. We never found out how, and why she killed the child.</p> 

<p>“Since she was taken to prison, the day after she was tried, a gentleman called here, and went up stairs, and sat there a long time; and then sent to speak to me. He seemed in great grief. When I came in he said, ‘My good woman, it was here, was it not, that the prisoner, now in Fredville gaol, lodged?’ I replied, indeed, sir, she did.”</p>

<p>“Did she never tell you from whence she came?”</p>
    
<p>“No, never; but we always thought she came from the West Indies.”</p>

<p>“Did she never tell you her history; who her husband was?”</p>

<p>“Never; she never spoke of herself. She was like an angel dropped from heaven. She came here in a carriage, from a sea-port, eighteen miles off; but my husband went there to see and find out something about her, but he could not.”</p>

<p>“Who was the gentleman?” said Fanny; “ was he tall, with curly hair?” </p>

<p>“I don’t know, Miss, who he was; but the people said he came from Derwent Castle. I never saw a gentleman more distressed.”</p>

<p>“I told you, Emily, how every one remarked that the poor young-woman looked at him and fainted, and that he was so agitated and changed after he returned from her trial.”</p>

<p>“He sat,” continued the woman, “at the window in her room, quite lost, like. He asked me if I thought she had poisoned her child. I answered, she loved that child,—she spent whole hours looking at it; we never heard her speak but in a gentle tone, and then, all at once, day after day, we heard her talk so loud and firm to the doctor. I asked what was the matter, and he said the baby was ill, and she was cross because he did not cure it at once. One day she came in a hurry ; she looked agitated, and she seemed to tremble very much.”</p>

<p>“When the child was dead, what did she do?”</p>

<p>“She carried it herself, and buried it under the grass, upon the top of the cliff; and she was sitting there by the little grave when they came to tell her she was said to have killed her child, and must go to be tried. She took little notice, but behaved as she did, I hear, in prison : never spoke. Her face looked set, like death. I wish I had never seen a creature so good, so young, and beautiful, in such trouble.”</p>

<p>“You think she was very good?”</p> 

“<p>She was the most modest creature I ever saw. My husband always said he was sure she was the wife of some great man. After sitting an hour here the gentleman went away, and we have never heard of him since. He went first to the doctor’s, but, as I said, he was gone.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Lady Emily, “it is useless paining you any more—we cannot do any good.” Thanking her, they got into their pony carriage, and drove home. The whole thing seemed like a deep tragedy, seen on the stage, till the curtain fell, and nothing more could be known. The only point of practical interest now was, the eondition and treatment of the poor lunatic.</p>

<p>We have said that Lady Emily was forbidden to visit her; but though she could not act against the positive orders of Lord Derwent and the physician, she was determined to drive, from time to time, to the unhappy abode, to hear what was the report given of the interesting sufferer.</p>

<p>We who live in an age when so much has been done to better the regulation of mad-houses—when parliamentary commissioners have disclosed such atrocities, and when public opinion now extends, and regulates, and softens the barbarities which formerly marked the treatment of lunatics, can have no idea of the scenes which were once enacted in Bedlam and St. Luke’s hospitals.</p>

<p>Among all the sufferings of the sons and daughters of Adam, amid all the painful disorders to which they are subject, none deserve so much pity, so much tenderness, so much consideration, as those which arise from minds alienated and disordered. With a nervous system, often so constituted, that they are morbidly alive and sensitive to that of which others are unconscious—with feelings so quick, yet so ill placed, that they can never command sympathy ; sometimes without a dormant nerve in their body, they have been treated like the beasts of the field, or chained in loathsome cells, as if to fetter and torture the body, to irritate and ridicule, coerce and conceal, were the remedies likely to alleviate or cure the sufferings of a diseased mind.</p>

<p>At this time the principle of soothing and amusing was never thought of—a mad doctor was a profession from which every one recoiled ; it was not as now regarded as one peculiarly favourable to the philosophical study of the human mind, and likely to call forth all the resources of a patient and compassionate heart. The principle was not then admitted that a lunatic hospital was not a cage in which to shut up wild beasts, with iron bars and grating, but a house of safe keeping for the desolate and afflicted, where every art should be used to cure and dispel, or sooth and allay, the disorder which will not yield to remedies</p>.

Lady Emily Somerton knew but little of I what was going on within those walls, and only regarded them with instinctive horror. Having heard at her uncle’s table some passing remarks on the ill-treatment of some one who had been falsely detained in a lunatic vasylum, she was determined to drive over and inquire how the prisoner for whom she was interested, fared. Though interdicted from all attempts to see her, she would, at all events, satisfy herself that she was well used. She never could obtain any information sufficiently detailed to satisfy her anxiety, and was obliged to content herself with instantly imploring Lord Derwent to use his privilege, as a governor, to examine into the management of the institution.

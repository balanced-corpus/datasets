The law was precise; the body of my poor friend must be buried within a short space of time, and it was useless 
to think of tracing out the assassin, Harold Yonge said. I sat all day by his body, the body that had held a noble 
spirit, called away before its time. At night I lay down on the improvised couch of fodder by the bed-side, jealous 
lest any one should dispute with me the right of paying the last honours to my dead friend Wearied out, I slept soundly, 
and woke to listen for his voice, the voice that would never, never speak again!
</p>
<p>
The door below was being opened, and two men in black were bringing in a coffin. Harold Yonge and Baze were with them. 
We took one last look at the face I loved so well, I touched the forehead with my lips, and we were soon on the way 
to ‘<em>Père Lachaise.</em>‘ No one noticed the little cavalcade, or only to raise their hats as we went by. Harold 
Yonge had done all that was necessary for the funeral; he and Baze were the only mourners beside myself, and as Yonge 
knew no Protestant minister, and it was useless for me to attempt to find one, we were going to bury him without 
any religious ceremonial.
</p>
<p>
When we reached the grave I found it had been dug in the part which crowns the hill that overlooks the Bastille 
column, where so many of the English who have died in Paris lie. I was glad to think that his body would be 
amongst the dust of Englishmen, and I briefly thanked Harold for his thoughtfulness. I asked him if he would object 
to my saying a few words, and reading part of a chapter from the Bible, and as he did not, I repeated as far as 
I could recollect those impressive sentences from the burial service of the Church of England, and then read the 
last chapter of Revelations as far as the seventeenth verse. The rest was soon done. Harold Yonge had to hurry back 
to his duties, giving me the address where I should be able to find him. Baze stopped with me till the grave was 
finished, and I had made a sketch of its position, and had noted those that surrounded it. I then had a little 
wooden cross put in the ground at the grave’s head, so as still further to identify the spot. We left the peaceful 
cemetery with its thousands of illustrious dead, now on a level with the most humble, and as we threaded our way 
back through the streets of tombs, we little thought how fierce a battleground that quiet cemetery would shortly 
become.
</p>
<p>
Baze had told me that it was useless thinking of going to an hotel, as he had inquired at several, but was told 
that they could not take any lodgers yet, having nothing to give them to eat. He proposed that I should go and 
stay with him while I remained, as he was quite sure his family would give me a cordial welcome, and as strangers 
were now coming into Paris I should not run any risk. I could not think of going back again to the <em>hangar</em>, 
and I knew no one to whom I could go, so I gladly accepted Baze’s offer.
</p>
<p>
Now that such a terrible calamity had befallen me, I thought only of completing my business, and leaving as quickly 
as possible. I wrote to Mr Norton, telling him of the death of Charlie Pratt, not doubting that the letter would 
reach him. I also wrote to Jenkinson, advising him of my having sold the Chuggaree, and that I should come back 
as soon as possible. Baze took me to the business houses whose names Jenkinson had given me. One or two of the 
firms had a partner or representative at the office, but the major part of them were absent, and the offices were 
securely fastened, and the windows barricaded; those whom I saw expressed astonishment that I should come looking 
after money at such a time, when the Prussians were at the gates, and no one knew what was about to happen. It is 
an unthankful task to ask payment of just debts, but when reproaches and contumely are given instead of payment, the 
unpleasantness is aggravated.
</p>
<p>
‘Just like you English,’ said one man; ‘I wonder you did not get a <em>laisser-passer</em> while the war was 
still raging, to come and see whether we had all run away, but I believe you would go straight from your mother’s 
funeral to collect a debt; you are men without sentiment.’
</p>
<p>
This speech cut me to the heart, for if I had not buried my mother, God be thanked, I had just come from burying 
one who had been dear to me as a brother. 
</p>
<p>
Having called upon all the houses, and Baze agreeing with me that I was not likely to do any good by stopping 
longer, I determined to return to London at once, as I knew that Jenkinson would be anxious to ship the Chuggarree 
forthwith, and I could neither depend on letters nor telegrams reaching him promptly. My calls had occupied me a 
couple of days, and the second afternoon, Baze, who lived in the direction of <em>Les Ternes</em>, near to the 
fortifications, took me to see the havoc that had been done. The splendid avenues, which bore the names of 
<em>l’Imperatrice</em>, and of the <em>Grande Armée</em>, were dug up into pits intended to be pit-falls for 
the Prussians, for wire rope had been strung across them, and stakes driven into the ground to keep it ‘taut,’ at 
a few inches above the soil, and as it was crossed and recrossed in fifty different ways, there would have been 
little chance of the hated Prussians escaping such traps. At the fortifications the guard was mounted as if war 
had been actually raging, the houses bore traces of the shells which rained over this part of Paris. The fine 
mansions were all deserted, and where had been gaily dressed throngs driving or riding to the <em>Bois de Boulogne</em>, 
there passed now and again an orderly, mounted perchance on a mule or dirty and shaggy pony, or a few straggling 
<em>Mobiles</em> who had come to see what was going on. The trees which had formerly flourished quite up to the 
fortifications were cut down to a considerable distance, and their blackened stumps had furnished nightly marks 
for the rifles of the sentries, who persisted in mistaking them for Prussians coming singlehanded to take the city.
</p>
<p>
It might have been the awfully sudden death of him who had been my companion so lately that preyed upon my mind 
and made me morbidly sensitive, or the desolate aspect of what had evidently been a beautiful part, together with 
the dull, cold, raw weather, which chilled me, and made me fear that my troubles were not at an end; or, perchance, 
it was that wonderful prescience, which every one at times must have experienced without knowing to what cause 
to attribute it, that more often foretells calamity than joy, which weighed upon me like the hand of Fate, and made 
me painfully aware of fresh trials to undergo.
</p>
<p>
On the evening of the second day, finding that I could not leave the city so easily as I had expected, and that 
I must remain till the following day in order to procure a ticket for the railway, I determined to go to <em>La 
Chapelle</em>, see Harold Yonge, and bid him good-bye before starting for London. M. Baze, who had been indefatigable 
in rendering me every assistance in his power, was unable to go, but I said that I had no hesitation in going 
alone, nor had I,—my depression caused me mental uneasiness rather than bodily fear.
</p>
<p>
It was toward six o’clock in the evening when I reached the headquarters of the —th battalion of the National 
Guards. Harold Yonge was not at the barracks, and I was on the point of departing, much disappointed at not 
being able to see him, when the soldier who had brought the various things to the <em>hangar</em> came up to me, 
and asked me if it was M. Yonge whom I was looking for. The sight of this soldier seemed to bring back to my 
mind my poor friend, and I could not refrain from bursting into tears.
</p>
<P>
‘Yes, I know,’ said the soldier, ”tis a bad affair, your friend is dead, poor unfortunate,’ and he too shed a 
tear in sympathy with my grief. He told me that if I wanted ‘Monsieur Yonge’ I should find him at a small 
restaurant close by, where he generally went to dine at this hour. ‘But hold,’ said he, ‘I will conduct you 
there if you wish.’
</p>
<p> 
I thanked him, and said I should be much obliged if he would. We found Harold Yonge with three more, who appeared 
to be officers, or above the rank of privates. He introduced me as a friend from England, and as they were about 
to dine, he pressed me to dine with them. They made me recount my adventures, and were horrified at the story 
of the assassination, although they had already heard something of it from Harold.
</p>
<p>
‘Why had not justice taken up the affair?’
</p>
<p>
Harold Yonge explained that death had resulted quicker than the surgeon had anticipated, and that it would have 
been useless, as no one knew who actually struck the blow. Then they talked of ‘<em>Les Venguers,</em>‘ and I 
gathered from what they said that the Society was a very powerful organization, and one which they individually 
would do well to keep clear of. They looked upon me as somewhat of a hero, and were much interested in learning 
what was thought in England of the war.
</p>
<p>
I told them that the defence of Paris, and the courageous conduct of the army, in fighting stubbornly after all hope 
of success was gone, had called forth admiration on all sides, even from their enemies.
</p>
<p>
They said that they were glad that at any rate their efforts had not been thrown away, and all they hoped for 
was that terms of peace might be made too hard for France to be able to accept. Bismarck and the Devil seemed 
synonymous terms to them, and they even went so far as to assert their preference for dealing with the Devil to 
having anything whatever to do with Bismarck. I thought they seemed somewhat desperate in their way of thinking and 
talking, but they were evidently men who had recieved a good education, and they appeared to know more of the 
political bearings of the war, and of the causes which had led to it, than I did. Gradually under the influence 
of their lively conversation my depression wore off; Harold Yonge talked of coming to London by and by with one 
of them, for a change after the privations of the siege; but he said that as the National Guards were wanted for 
the present to keep order in the city, he should not be able to fix the time with any degree of certainty.
</p>
<p> 
I assured him and his friend that I would do all in my power to make their visit agreeable. I said I thought it 
a pity they could not all come, for I felt sure that if they could come and see busy London they would be 
astonished.
</p>
<p>
‘Ah, poor Paris! you must not judge of her by what you see now, with streets not lighted, and no carriages, no 
movement; but we shall get over it, and Paris will again assert herself as the Queen of Cities.’
</p>
<p>
‘Here’s a toast,’ said Harold Yonge; and when they had all filled their glasses he gave ‘Paris,’ and in response 
to the call of ‘<em>Trinquez, trinquez,</em>‘ we jingled the edges of the glasses together in that peculiar 
manner which passes among the French for a token of good-fellowship.
</p>
<p>
We had hardly put the glasses down when a girl came into the restaurant, walked straight to the table at which 
we were sitting, and took a seat opposite Harold Yonge, one of the Frenchmen making room for her by his side. 
It was a small and unpretentious sort of place, that restaurant, with its cane-bottomed square stools, marble-topped 
tables, and sanded floor, but nevertheless the cooking was excellent, whatever the viands operated upon might have 
been, but in those times it did not do to be too exacting as to the quality of the meat or its origin.
</p>
<p>
‘<em>Ninette! Ninette! Bonsoir ma petite,</em>‘ and various other greetings welcomed the girl as she sat down, 
shaking hands all round, giving her right hand to Harold Yonge and her left to the three Frenchmen in turn. One 
of them introduced me by the name of ‘<em>Mons. l’Anglais,</em>‘ and Ninette gave me something between a saucy nod 
and a grimace of recognition. She was certainly very good-looking, with eyes black as coal, but bright and 
sparkling as diamonds, black hair, fair skin, and rather delicate features. Her dress was neat, but coquettish in 
the extreme. Although she was dressed in black, one would never have said she was in mourning; the little dainty 
cape trimmed with lace, which covered her shoulders, did not entirely conceal her well-rounded bust, and the 
black bonnet had beads and other gewgaws that relieved what would otherwise have been a sombre costume. Although 
she sat opposite to Harold Yonge, she addressed most of her conversation to him, but he replied in monosyllables only; 
he had been talkative up to the time of Ninette coming into the restaurant, but her presense seemed to act as a 
restraint upon him. Not so with her, for she had plenty of repartee to spare for the three Frenchmen, who all 
addressed her in the second person singular, which I knew was a mark of great familiarity. Perhaps she was the 
sister of one of the officers, or possibly they were all related, and it was a little family party. I was glad 
for a moment to think that even at such a time young girls—for she could not have been more than eighteen—could 
mix freely with their brothers and friends in places of public resort without fear of being shocked or insulted, 
and I began to think that the state of Paris was not so black as it had generally been painted by writers imbued 
with ‘insular prejudices.’
</p>
<p>
Of course the health of Ninette was duly honoured by the occupants of the table, Harold Yonge alone of the party 
seeming to be constrained and drinking the toast in silence; but perhaps her presence called up recollections of 
a comrade whom he had attended in his last hours, and the girl’s light-hearted gaiety appeared to him out of place. 
Ninette twitted Harold Yonge on his silence, calling him her ‘big baby,’ ‘my dear,’ and ‘Jules,’ which I thought 
somewhat free on her part; but then I knew that <em>entre amis</em> more license was allowed than would be 
considered at home to be within the limits of strict propriety. 
Harold Yonge looked at his watch as if he wanted to go, but Ninette, affecting to be moved to tears, said it was 
not ‘<em>gentil</em>‘ of him, now that she had only just come, to be thinking of going, and she leaned across 
the narrow table and pouted her lips toward him. Harold drew back, but she protested that she would not be 
satisfied until he had kissed her, and she stamped her foot as if to enforce her will. Harold Yonge just touched 
her lips with his own, and blushed as he did so.
</p>
<p>
‘<em>Ma foi!</em>‘ exclaimed one of the officers, bursting into a loud laugh in which the others joined; ‘he does 
not like his friend to witness his little indiscretions.’
</p>
<p>
Ninette joined in the laugh at Harold Yonge’s expense, and he appeared more discomfited than ever, but endeavouring 
to master his momentary embarrassment, said, ‘That’s nothing to me;’ and turning toward me, he said in English, ‘Arthur, 
I will go a little way with you;’ but ass he prepared to rise one of the officers cried, ‘A toast, a toast! I 
drink to the health of Jules and Ninette, and to their eternal happiness.’ All glasses were filled, and the jingling 
was gone through again, but though I touched my glass with theirs I did not drink; a sad foreboding had come over 
me, I wanted to get away from the place, out into the open air, anywhere from my suspicions.
</p>
<P>
The party broke up, and Harold Yonge bade them all good-night, but Ninette would not leave him, although he 
told her he was going to accompany me to a distant part of the town, and evidently much to his annoyance she kept 
close by him for some distance down the street. He spoke to me in English, and she said that it was not ‘<em>gentil</em>‘ 
for him to be talking in a language she did not understand, and no doubt he was saying things about her which he 
would not say in French, and it was only after his promising to meet her at the ‘<em>Galeries d’Enfer</em>‘ later 
in the evening, that she left us.
</p>
<p>
We walked on for some minutes in silence; I, after the strange exhibition I had just seen, not knowing what to 
think or what to say. Yes, much better that my suspicions should be only suspicions, and that I might still esteem, 
in spite of appearances, the friend who had so many good and noble qualities.
</p>
<p>
Harold Yonge was the first to speak. ‘You wonder who Ninette is, I suppose?’
</p>
<p>
‘Yes,I did wonder, but I would rather not know, if, that is—I don’t want to know,’ I replied somewhat confused.
</p>
<p>
‘Oh! it is much better to be honest, and I don’t know why I should hide it from you. She is my mistress.’
</p>
<p>
I involuntarily moved a step further from him as he made this avowal to me; to me, who had up til then thought him 
a pattern of morality despite his infidel opinions, and almost, I fear, because of them. There had always seemed to 
me such pride in the very nature of Harold Yonge, that he could never, never descend to the level of coarse and 
sensual souls who respect neither themselves nor others.
</p>
<p>
‘You shun me now, because I have told you,’ he said in a somewhat injured tone. ‘You are like the rest of the world, 
I suppose, and if I had said nothing about it you would have been none the wiser, and whatever you might have suspected—’
</p>
<p>
‘Enough, enough, Harold; pray don’t reproach me for shunning you; if I do, it is in sorrow, not in anger, for no 
doubt your temptations have been greater than mine,’ I answered. ‘God forbid that I should judge you; but how could 
you! <em>you</em>, whom I had set up as the incarnation of morality without religion; you, who always held that 
a man should respect himself; who used to be working for and aspiring after the ‘perfectibility’ of the human race, 
guided by the dictates of Reason; how do you reconcile your professions with your present practices?’
</p>
<p>
‘Well, I was enthusiastic then; the Infidels I knew were men of the highest honour and morality, men of position, 
and probably without temptation to go astray from the path of virtue, or their standard was higher than it is among 
the Infidels here, I don’t know which; but here I found everything so different, so different; perhaps if I admit 
the truth to you, it is because I know you will feel for me if you cannot any longer respect me. Here all are 
Infidels, not from a conviction that Reason is the goddess who if faithfully followed will inevitably lead them 
to the Light, but Infidels from the <em>absense of Conviction</em>, and consequently they find it easier to do 
without any belief. I can’t tell you how I battled against this want of conviction for a time, how I was ridiculed 
and kept to myself, and then in sheer determination of probing to the bottom of their easy-going philosophy, or 
want of philosophy, I succumbed.’
</p>
<p>
Harold Yonge had said this in a musing manner, rather as if talking to himself than to me, and I felt indeed that he 
had been standing upon an unsound basis, that at the first real shock of overmastering temptation the item of his 
individual working toward the perfectibility of the human race had weighed as but a grain of sand in the balance which 
held in the other scale Gratification, Pleasure, and Lust. ‘Oh! would that you had been a Christian, Harold, then this 
had not happened!’ was all I could exclaim, as my thoughts went back to the chapel where he had worshipped, a true 
believer and a teacher of the faith, till doubts had risen in his mind, and the squabbles of professors had lost 
him his soul; God forgive those professors!
</p>
<p>
He walked on in silence till I said, ‘Come back with me to England, Harold, and leave this hateful place, and lead 
a new life, and God will forgive you yet if you only repent.’
</p>
<p>
‘Impossible, impossible; I have my duties here, and then—Ninette.’
</p>
<p>
‘Well, if you really care for her, love her, then marry her, and make an honest woman of her, and wipe out this 
stain.’
</p>
<p>
‘Marry her, marry her, oh! no, I couldn’t do that,’ he replied, still musing, but I thought with a touch of his native 
pride showing itself. ‘And beside, she would not care to marry me if I asked her.’
</p>
<p>
‘Have you ever asked her, have you ever told her the sin that you have been led into, and that you are willing and 
anxious to make reparation as far as lies in your power? if you tell her this I know—at least I feel sure—she would 
consent to marry you, and with your talents you might go abroad, and in some distant land be happy still, far away 
from the old associations, and God would bless you repentant, even now.’
</p>
<p>
I had spoken with earnestness, for I felt how precarious was the influence I had over Harold Yonge; if I left Paris at 
once, as I must do, I might never have such an oppurtunity of urging upon him to alter his course, and now that 
his confession was fresh his heart showed signs of yielding to my persuasion. ‘Impossible, impossible,’ was all he 
murmured, musing still, then suddenly he stopped, drew himself up, and said, ‘You ask too much of me; if after the war 
is finished I get away from here, I shall go to America; but I could never marry Ninette.’ Here he spoke with all 
his old fire and proud bearing. ‘She professes to love me, and if I die or go away she will make the same profession 
to another and love him just as well; no, I could never marry a ——, <!-- omission dash -->that is out of the question.’ We had reached 
a point whence a street ran in a direct line to the house of M. Baze, and Harold Yonge said that he must return 
now if I thought I could find my way alone.
</p>
<p>
‘I can find my way well enough now, thank you, but I can’t leave you without you make me a promise that if you can’t 
marry this girl you will give up living with her.’
</p>
<p>
‘I can promise nothing, for I generally perform my promises, and I would not forsake her now, poor Ninette.’
</p>
<p>
And here his thoughts seemed to be going away again from me, and occupied in retracing step by step that past 
which had led him to where at one time he had so little thought of sinking. 
</p>
<p>
‘Good night, and good-bye,’ he said, holding out his hand to me. 
</p>
<p>
‘No promise, then, not even of endeavour to repair the past and lead a new life in the future; for my sake, 
for your own, for the sake of those you have left in England—your mother—oh! Harold, what would she say if 
she knew all!’
</p>
<p> 
He turned away his head so that I should not see a tear fall, and as we stood under a large branching gas-lamp, 
then illuminated only by two little oil wicks, which shed their light but a few feet around, he withdrew his hand 
from mine, saying, ‘I will think about it; good-bye,’ and so went away into the outer darkness,—and I never saw 
him more.

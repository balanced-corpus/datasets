<title>A Flight to Florida: And All that Came of It, Chapter 13 by Peregrinator</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">

<p>A long and severe illness succeeded this terrible accident, but Raby lived through it all ; notwithstanding that when she first heard her doom, her grief and despair were so overwhelming that she would have much preferred death to life.</p>

<p>She never murmured, however. On the contrary from the very first she accepted her destiny with a patient sweetness and resignation which surprised everybody ; and often when her aunt was present assumed a cheerfulness she was far from feeling, in order if possible to lighten the poor old lady’s burden which was already
much heavier than she could bear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Glendinning lingered on at Ladiston ; for while Raby’s life was hanging on a thread he could not tear himself away, and after she was pronounced out of danger, that is to say of death, he had by that time become so indispensable to Miss Audane — who literally clung to him in her despair — that he felt it was only right to remain with her as long as he could.</p>

<p>Now this may seem strange at first, but in reality it was not so, for Glendinning was no longer the same man that he had been.  The discipline of life had wrought a great change in him ; and troubles and trials had done their work so effectually that it seemed as if the terrible calamity with which he had just been brought face to face had been the one thing needful to awaken the latent tenderness of his nature and bring all his better and higher qualities into play. Hence instead of being the cold, careless, unemotional Glendinning of other days, it was he who now thought of everything and <em>for</em> everybody ; it was he who soothed his poor old friend in her almost insupportable sorrow ; and it was he who got everything that money could procure for the poor sufferer, or that he fancied might alleviate her pain in the very slightest degree. The consequence was that Miss Audane began ere long to regard this tender, thoughtful, generous friend almost in the light of a son, and to lean on him with such confidence in every emergency that when at length he was obliged to leave her and go back to his own people she felt as if she had sustained an irreparable loss and refused to be comforted. He, however, promised her that he would not remain very long away, that he would return as soon as he possibly could. And he kept his word. For after having spent a few weeks in St Augustine with his mother and sister he once more set out for Ladiston, which had now begun to seem to him almost like a second home, and to which on this occasion he returned with peculiar impatience ; for as by that time Raby was moved in each day to one of the sitting-rooms he knew he should be able to see her when he arrived.</p>

<p>But though the prospect of being with her again filled him with joy, it was a pleasure which merged into pain when he thought of the wreck of that fair young life, lately so full of hope and happiness, and of the dark doom which had fallen on one so sweet and blameless that, humanly speaking, fate should have reserved its best and brightest gifts for her. His heart was therefore sore troubled. And whether he looked backwards or forwards or at the miserable present, the prospect on all sides was so cheerless and sad that just then the whole world seemed to him to be full of gloom. And yet as he journeyed along towards his destination, and as night came on with its sweet influences and holy calm, there was something in the aspect of nature which seemed to harmonise with his mood and which insensibly soothed him. Moreover it appeared to him that in the tender light which the moon was then shedding upon that favoured region it had acquired a thousand new beauties. For the deep blue vault above looked unusually high and was glittering like steel ; and at the same time Sirius was sending a long line of light across the lake, so bright and beautiful that it appeared like a link between this world and the next—a pathway along which an angel might come from some far off sphere beyond the skies to visit earthly homes and human hearts. And as Glendinning’s eyes rested on that glorious ray, the almost spiritual loveliness of the hour and scene affected him so deeply that for the moment his thoughts were unconsciously upraised to those worlds of light above him, which in their serene, uninterrupted harmony of movement present such a contrast to the unending mutations of this life, where at one instant we are raised above the world on the wings of some soaring thought, and the next, perhaps, grovelling on the earth again and sunk in an abyss of misery which no words could be found to describe.</p>

<p>By that time he had almost reached the house—and as he gazed around him he experienced a strange, unwonted sensation, for it seemed to him that by some peculiar and unaccountable process every object he beheld was being photographed on his memory with such preternatural vividness and distinctness that no after time could ever obliterate or efface a single detail. There was in fact something almost uncanny about the feeling. And as if to emphasise it, just at the moment a delicious mockingbird was pouring forth its soul in song from a large cocoa-nut tree at the back of the house, and uttering notes which, to one who had never heard them before,
were like a new revelation in bird-music.</p>

<p>But then the impassioned song of a Floridian mocking-bird is like nothing else in the world. For his voice is rich, clear, and musical, and capable of almost every modulation ; and while in measure and accent he faithfully follows his originals, in force and sweetness of expression he greatly improves upon them, and seems to impart some of his own individuality to everything he utters. The result is that at one moment his notes ring out with a spontaneous gush of joy, and at another you hear a soft, dreamy, dying fall so full of pathos that you almost think the bird must suffer as he sings. His song is thus a veritable romance. A romance, too, wherein light and shade and joy and sorrow are so intermingled and blent together that it closely resembles and almost seems to form part of ” the sad, sweet music of humanity.”</p>

<p>Poor Raby was listening to this wondrous flood of melody when Glendinning arrived—but when she heard his foot step in the hall her heart almost stood still. For she, too, dreaded the first meeting, although at the same time she longed for it with such feverish impatience that she had been literally counting the hours until he came.</p>

<p>But the period of weary waiting and suspense was nearly over then—for the next minute she heard the handle of the door turning, and in another second he was in the room.</p>

<p>Now it has been truly said that there are some meetings which are far sadder than any partings could possibly be, and this was one of them. For while Raby’s heart fainted within her when she thought of all she had lost since she saw him last, he in his turn visibly started when his glance first fell upon her death-like face and
he noted the total eclipse of hope in her once glad, beautiful eyes. Indeed so deeply did he feel that even after he had taken her hand in his and sat down beside her, though he tried hard to speak and his lips moved no sound issued from them.</p>

<p>“You feel for me,” said the poor girl at last—” I see you do—and your sympathy is very sweet. It is all that is left to me now, and I value it—it is precious to me. Ah, if you only knew what I have gone through since I last saw you, since that dreadful day ! It isn’t only the bodily pain—though that is often torture—but it is the unspeakable anguish of knowing that as I am so I must be for evermore—that in this world there is no limit to my suffering ! “</p>

<p>“But you are better,” said Glendinning brokenly, and almost without knowing what he was saying—for his soul was stirred to its very depths at witnessing this mighty sorrow which admitted of no hope, no alleviation, no comfort ; and so boundless was his pity for her at that moment, that it would hardly be too much to say that for the time being his pain was scarcely less great than her own.</p>

<p>” Yes,” she answered sadly, ” I am as much better as I shall ever be. But oh, to think what it is to lie here for ever and ever while life lasts without hope or respite ! The thought is maddening. I try hard to bear it patiently—I do indeed—but sometimes it
is impossible. I lose all power of self-command—and then my poor aunt prays for me—it’s all that can be done. Oh, if God would only take me and let me be at rest ! ” added the poor sufferer ; and as she said this she clasped her thin hands together, and raised her eyes to heaven with such an agony of supplication in them that the old lady sobbed aloud ; while as for Glendinning, strong and  self-contained as he was, he was perfectly unmanned, and starting to his feet he began pacing distractedly up and down the room, utterly unable any longer even to maintain an appearance of composure.</p>

<p>At last, however, mastering his emotion by a great effort, he sat down again, and taking her little wasted hand into his own he reasoned and pleaded with her so gently and tenderly that she grew gradually calmer and better able to listen to him. And then he reminded her how wrong it was to wish to die—and added that it
was very unkind, too, when she knew that her aunt and everyone who loved her would fain keep her with them if they could.</p>

<p>” Ah,” she responded sorrowfully, ” you forget that I am a burden to her now as well as to myself—and besides that, I suffer so much that everybody who has any—any regard for me ought to wish and pray for my release. But,” she added, ” I have often thought latterly that I need not repine so much, for I think it will be all over sooner than anyone expects.”</p>

<p>“All over!” echoed Glendinning—and there was such unfathomable despair in his tone and his face as he spoke that for the moment Raby almost forgot her own suffering in thinking of his. ” You don’t mean that you are going to leave us, my—” But suddenly recollecting that her aunt was still in the room, he continued in a tone so low as to be almost inaudible, — ” You make me feel quite heartbroken when you talk in that way—and I think if you knew what I suffer you would have some pity. I was sure — that is, I fancied that there were some whom you cared so much for that you would like to live for their sakes, and it is very bitter to me to find that I was mistaken.”</p>

<p>Baby’s thin face flushed as she drank in these words which meant so much, and her voice trembled with emotion as she said in reply, —</p>

<p>” Ah, if you knew all, if I could explain everything to you, you. would not blame me for wishing to die ! But,” she added, ” even if I did not wish it I really don’t think I can last very long, for the constant pain must wear me out.”</p>

<p>” No, no, no,” he cried, in a voice almost as heartbroken as her own, ” it will not wear you out—something can be done, something must be done for you. I have just been speaking to your aunt about it” [Miss Audane had left the room a few moments previously] ” and she has promised me that she will bring you to England—and once there, I shall have all the doctors in London to see you, and you know they can perform miracles ; besides there is a chair that will make you so much easier and—”</p>

<p>” And you have thought of all this—and for me ! ” exclaimed Raby, with the deepest gratitude ; ” surely, surely there never was so kind a friend ! “</p>

<p>“A <em>friend</em> !” echoed Glendinning reproachfully—” oh, Raby, have you so completely misread me as to believe that I am still nothing more than a friend ? “</p>

<p>And the next minute he was on his knees beside her couch, and as he encircled her with his arm and drew her to his breast he said with faltering tenderness,—</p>

<p>” No, it is not a friend that I would be but something far nearer
if you will let me — and it is not friendship that I offer you but the strong, deep love of my whole soul — a love that was never given to anyone but yourself either. I know now,” he went on — ” for Miss Audane has explained everything to me—that my jealous fears were all groundless and that you never cared for anyone else — and if you will promise now to give yourself to me, oh, Raby, my little love, I can imagine no higher happiness than being able to devote myself to you and having your dear companionship for evermore.”</p>

<p>Raby trembled as she listened to this impassioned appeal and for an instant so intense was her joy that her face literally shone as though it had been suddenly transfigured ; but the next minute with a painful revulsion of feeling she exclaimed piteously,—</p>

<p>” Ah, I know how it is — you pity me, and in your great and boundless kindness you would sacrifice yourself, you would devote yourself to me if I permitted it — but it isn’t that you really care for me or—”</p>

<p>” No, it is not that I care for you,” said Glendinning, interrupting her and purposely misinterpreting her words — “it is that <em>I love you,</em> Raby, my best and dearest — that I have loved you through all these years — yes even when I believed it was a sin to think of you — and that you are not only as dear to me as ever, but far dearer now — hopeless, helpless, and hapless though you may be, than you were in the days of your beauty and pride. Listen to me,” he added, ” and you shall hear all —my whole confession.” And then, beginning from the beginning he did tell her all — how that almost from the first she had dazzled aud bewitched him although he had fought hard against the feeling and for a long time would not admit its existence even to himself : how that he felt almost maddened the day that she confessed she had been engaged, and as he concluded, attached to another man : how determined he was to try and learn to <em>un</em>love her if possible : but that having failed utterly he was just going to write and tell her so when the dreadful news reached him that she was going to be married ! after which, he said, life had to all intents and purposes become a blank to him, for he neither cared where he went nor what became of him.</p>

<p>” And did you really suffer so much through me ? ” cried Raby excitedly. ” Is it, can it be true ? I can scarcely believe it possible ! “</p>

<p>And as she said this she looked up into his face with such pathetic eyes that again he felt quite unnerved as he gazed into their sorrowful depths. But his answer, presently given, was so solemn and convincing and his manner so earnest as he said, — ” It is as true as that you hear me utter the words ! ” that she could doubt no more ; and bowing her head on her breast as though to let the bitter, pitiless storm of sorrow sweep over her, she wailed out those mournful words which might be called the sad and in evitable refrain of life, ” Too late ! too late ! “</p>

<p>” Why should it be too late ? ” asked Glendinning miserably, for there was a sort of knell in her tone which sent a thrill of despair through his own soul as he listened to it.</p>

<p>” Because I could not accept such a sacrifice from you,” was the faltering, whispered answer. ” Had you spoken those words to me when I was well and strong, I loved you so utterly — I need not mind telling you this now —- that I should not have needed to die and enter heaven to know what perfect happiness was, I should not indeed, but now — O God, think what I am now ! what I have become, and then think how selfish and cruel it would be of me if I
were to accept what you offer.”</p>

<p>” Raby,” said Glendinning, still more earnestly and solemnly, ” it could not be selfish or cruel to grant a man the one blessing he craves from heaven, the only boon he covets on earth, and I swear to you that if you refuse me this little hand mine shall never clasp that of any other woman, and I told my mother so last night.”</p>

<p>” Oh, I cannot, I cannot,” sobbed the poor girl whose mind was so
distracted by conflicting feelings that she hardly knew what she was
saying. ” It <em>would</em> be cruel of me to take advantage of your generosity. Think what your life would be if it were linked to mine. Think of all it would entail on you, all that it would debar you from—”</p>

<p>” I <em>have</em> thought of everything,” was the reply. ” Life is never all smoothness and pleasantness, there are always drawbacks even in the happiest circumstances, and I know well what I shall suffer in seeing <em>you</em> suffer — God knows how gladly I would bear the pain in your stead if I could —but in the great happiness of feeling that you are all my own, that nothing can part us, that I can be always with you and that I am ministering to your comfort in however slight a degree, I shall be strong to bear everything else. Yes, Raby, your home is here, and you must come to it and atone to me for the miserable past. Promise that you will my dearest—say that you will come and fill my lonely heart which will be lonely for evermore in this world if you do not.”</p>

<p>And as he said this he looked so sad —for he really had begun to fear that he might not be able to shake her resolution —that Raby, who was listening to his words in a sort of trance of joy, could refuse no longer —it was impossible to resist the deep tenderness of that appeal — and with a cry of mingled rapture and pain she exclaimed,—</p>

<p>” Oh, if it is indeed so, if I can indeed make you any happier, I cannot deny your prayer though I feel I am doing wrong in granting it.” And as she uttered these words she laid her poor aching head on his breast, and the next moment hand to hand and lip to lip the solemn compact was sealed, and Glendinning’s heart’s desire was granted.</p>

<p>Thus he had found his mission in life at last, and well and nobly did he perform its sad, sweet duties. For he became not only feet to the lame and strength to the weak, but by his ceaseless devotion he contrived to infuse comfort, and even pleasantness into a life which but for him would have been all dreariness and gloom. With the lapse of years, too, the wail of pain was hushed by degrees, and on Raby’s darkened path a light ever shone so fair and unfading that she often acknowledged with a thankful heart that when her sun went down the stars came out.</p>

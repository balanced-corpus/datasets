<p>“Doctor Jobson! ” cried Councillor Latouche, one morning, running into the Doctor’s consulting room—the Councillor, a tall, bright, quick, energetic man, always seemed to run—“there’s to be a general election, and here’s a pretty go, Spriggs is to be put up!”</p>
<p>“Well, my dear Latouche,” said the Doctor calmly, “what of it? Just the sort of man for your Provincial Assembly I should say.”</p>
<p>“‘<i>Your</i>’ Provincial Assembly, Doctor!” replied the lawyer. “Why it is yours too. You are as much interested in our good government as I am. Why do you and Mrs. Jobson always talk of this country as if you were outside of it and had no part in it? Why your children will have to live here.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps you are right,” said the Doctor, blushing manfully, “it is a habit we have got into, arising perhaps out of the hope we cherish of transferring ‘ourselves some day to our old home. I confess it is very foolish. But at all events I cannot take much interest in that splashpool, <i>our</i>— if you please—Provincial Assembly.”</p>
<p>“Ah! steady, my boy!” replied Latouche. “Just look here. Parliament only meets about six weeks every Spring. You can easily get an assistant and spare the time.”</p>
<p>“Stop! stop! <i>Me?</i>” exclaimed the Doctor with conventional, if not grammatical propriety.</p>
<p>“<i>Me?</i>” He could hardly get his breath.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jobson at that moment entered the room. Latouche greeted her with an embarrassed air.</p>
<p>“What do you think, dear?” said Jobson—his face breaking out all over in a sunny smile. “Latouche has just proposed to me a great honour—to represent this town and district in the Provincial Assembly!”</p>
<p>“<i>Well</i>, Mr. Latouche!” said Mrs. J. with an energy and depth of sound that showed how real was her feeling. “What next? Is it not bad enough to be embroiled in a low struggle with Mr. Spriggs—without asking my husband to wade through deeper mire in order to step into such a sink of iniquity and horror as that?”</p>
<p>“My dear Mrs. Jobson,” began the lawyer with a depreeating smile.</p>
<p>“No, no, Mr. Latouche, don’t argue it. I know you are a clever lawyer; but this is a thing not to be thought of. It is useless to plead with me.”</p>
<p>“Stay!” cried Latouche with an energetic and peremptory voice which struck Mrs. Jobson as a little rude.</p>
<p>—“What if this is the only way to save Doctor Jobson from the difficulties arising through recent proceedings?”</p>
<p>Both the Doctor and his wife looked at the lawyer with a little surprise in their faces.</p>
<p>“How do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Latouche, “you don’t suppose this information is all over the town. I got it confidentially and no matter through whom. It is a move of the party on the other side. They had a meeting night before last at Fletcher’s. Some friend of theirs had brought the news by the Toronto boat. They resolved to put Spriggs up, and are calculating on his being returned unopposed. They think that there is no other possible candidate. They are sure of their own party, and they know all the rest of us are so taken up with other things. I can’t stand—the Mayor can’t stand—Morton can’t stand; you know he owes Fletcher and Spriggs nearly four thousand dollars—and the fact is you are the only man that can stand, and they decided there was no chance of you. Now you must stand just to spite them.”</p>
<p>“I won’t,” said Doctor Jobson.</p>
<p>“He shan’t,” said Mrs. Jobson.</p>
<p>The lawyer shook his head.</p>
<p>“Don’t be too hasty,” he said quietly. “If you don’t stand, Doctor Jobson, I do not see how we can carry on our fight with any chance of success. Spriggs is agent of the Bank of Montreal. He can get as much money as he wants on his mortgages, and I am convinced if the struggle goes on, not only will there be a frightful state of things in the county, but he will beat us. Now, if you stand, all that comes to an end. He will be obliged to withdraw all his notices from the farmers in order to get their votes. You will run him very close even if you don’t succeed. You force him to spend a lot of money. It will be the most expensive contest ever held in Cornwall,” chuckled Mr. Latouche, “and we’ll worry them, sir, we’ll worry them, before we have done.”</p>
<p>Doctor Jobson’s face grew longer as he gradually took in the Mephistophelean lawyer’s plan. He looked at the. Councillor and then looked at Mrs. Jobson, as if appealing for help against an idea winning its way.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jobson evinced a greater interest in the scheme. There was a certain daring cleverness about it which attracted her. And as Jobson considered it, he bethought him of many good reasons why he should sacrifice himself for the good of the country and perhaps of his children. But he was too cautious to commit himself in a hurry, so he prayed for time to think over it.</p>
<p>The wily Latouche saw that his victory was practically gained. He went across to the Judge, and made it all right with him. He took the Dean into confidence, and was encouraged by that spiritual authority. And he sent for Morton, who had great influence in the county, and held a conference with him. It was resolved by these worthies that the moment Spriggs had committed himself, Jobson was to be waited on with a requisition from the most respectable part of the town, and if he agreed should be brought out.</p>
<p>How did Mr. Latouche get his information? The day before, when school was over, David Roger, who had resumed his old steady ways, started off to get his couple of hours of fresh air and exercise. His route this time lay by the road along the bank of the river. In a very few minutes from the school-house gate, he had left behind him houses and gardens. The flat country stretched away to his left, large fields enclosed by dingy lines of “post and rail,” or by the irregular “snake” fences which seemed to wriggle across the plain, with their crossed stakes at short but regular intervals, giving one the idea of reticulations in the lengthy skeleton body. The stubble left by the gathered harvest already began to be smothered by the growing clover. Large tracks of the brownish-green leaves of mangel-wurzel here and there caught the eye. A few clumps of trees, with long straight trunks and tufting foliage towards the top, and a barn or two, diversified the scene, but that was all, until far away the lowering woods hemmed in the landscape. Some of the fields were dotted with stumps cicatriced by fire and weather, still remaining to remind the farmer how hardly the first victory over nature had been won, But when passing by the vast works on the new locks and the workmen’s huts at the mouth of the Canal, Roger descended a little on the road that led close by the bank of the Saint Lawrence, there was a marvellous change. On his right ran swiftly the wide river, a smooth moving plane. Stretching across, through vistas of islands for miles, the vast body of the stream passed on with a strange muffled noise. Up from below, as the mighty weight of water fretted across the hidden rocks, rose to the surface the rippling and bubbling currents. Circles played and eddies whirled in multitudinous variety of curves along the glistening plane. It seemed so potent that mass of waters, incomprehensibly vast yet rolling so calmly. Davy Roger loved to look at it. Far as his eye could reach it moved on majestic. Mile upon mile of living water, surging steadily and ceaselessly towards the ocean rest—a rest so brief and uncertain. Along the bank at intervals the bushes which grew luxuriantly in the virgin soil, and the trees that canopied the stream, looked down on the wrinkled surface at the shadows they threw, where in pellucid depths the perch loved to rest from tiring struggle with the stream, and the broad black bass gravely hovered near the rocks. Here and there in that vast expanse of moving brightness, lay islets green, embowered; and wherever the water was protected from movement, the graceful bending rushes grew, and among them lazily floating fed the wild duck, or now and then they rose with a chuckle and in fair order flew across the scene. Over all the great sun declining shed glow and sheen, while the sky above, cloudless and blue, gave a fine ethereal glamour to the restlessness of the mirror on which its reflection played. The evening was warm, but Roger was lightly clad in linen coat and trousers, his collar loose, his throat open, and his eye drinking in the beauty of the noble river in its beautiful setting of rock and wood, of promontory and island, all coroneted with foliage. He wandered long, and when he turned, came slowly back, pondering sad things of which that scene reminded him. His heart was empty now and life looked desolate with its endless vista of duty and its closed—up gates of love and hope; but he was a man and would at least face the time to come with manful resignation.</p>
<p>So he was thinking, when as he passed a small wood which occupied a jutting point of the river, he saw a figure, which seemed to attend his approach. He knew it at a glance. It was Miss Fletcher, who had suddenly stepped from behind a tree a few yards off the road, and made a motion for him to stop. She looked anxiously up and down the road, and then called out:</p>
<p>“Come here, Mr. Roger, I want to speak to you.”</p>
<p>Roger was a little disconcerted at this address. He did not fail in grateful feeling to his agreeable nurse, but there had been a little awkwardness about his last appearance, or rather disappearance, at Mr. Fletcher’s house, and besides he was naturally shy and afraid of women, generally believing them to be tricky and dangerous. This young lady now seemed to be anxious to draw him out of sight into the wood, and he hesitated a moment.</p>
<p>“Quick, Mr. Roger, or I shall run away!” cried Miss Amelia impatiently.</p>
<p>Though this was exactly what the schoolmaster would have given a great deal if she would do, he strode toward her upon this appeal.</p>
<p>“Here,” she said, “I must not be seen with you. I want to tell you something that is important to friends of yours. Let us walk out of sight.”</p>
<p>Roger prying into her dark eyes with his blue ones saw that there was seriousness in her meaning and no lightness in her manner, wherefore he hesitated no longer. His face even broke into a smile. Miss Amelia charmingly responded, showing her white teeth. She had agreeable, if not pretty features, and was tall, and rather elegant, and today dressed with great care. The nuns at Montreal teach excellent manners, and very fair taste. She put a little gloved hand on his arm.</p>
<p>“You know all the trouble there is,” she said, “between Mr. Spriggs and father and the rest and Dr. Jobson.”</p>
<p>He nodded. Master Roger was not overpolished.</p>
<p>“Well,” she said smiling “you are one of the ‘enemy,’ you know.”</p>
<p>“I?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You helped the—the Major ”—Roger’s eye darkened—“and are a friend of Doctor Jobson. So of course you must expect to he hated by those that hate them.”</p>
<p>“Why,” said Roger, “I have not interfered. I have done nothing. I couldn’t of course allow a man to be killed if I could prevent it.”</p>
<p>“No matter. They <i>hate</i> you, and see here, Mr. Roger,” she said eagerly, leaning towards him, “I am afraid—I—I mean there is danger,—they will try to get you removed from the school; so please be careful what you say or do, and keep your eyes wide open. You know I will tell you all I can get to hear.”</p>
<p>Roger had been walking alongside her among the trees, his hands behind his back, his big head thrown back, his hat well on the back of it. Miss Amelia’s hand was no longer on his arm. He looked at her again keenly and a a flush went over his forehead. Why shouldn’t he go away? what did all this interest mean? was the natural idea that flashed through his mind. She saw quickly enough all that was passing there and changed the subject.</p>
<p>“Then there’s another thing. You must manage to tell Doctor Jobson or Mr. Latouche,—he is the quickest man they say—yesterday afternoon a man arrived in the boat—a friend of father’s—from Toronto. There is to be an election very soon. In the evening father and Councillor Jewett and Spriggs were in the parlour talking for hours, and as the window was open I could hear nearly all they said. At my window—you know it—” she stopped and glanced at her companion, over whose face came a swift flash of fun and then a cloud—“over the parlour.”</p>
<p>“This is not right,” said David Roger, simply and decidedly. He stopped and looked at her. The blood rushed to her face. “It is not right, my dear Miss Fletcher, to tell me this. You heard it by—by—”</p>
<p>“By listening, Mr. Roger, that’s how you hear everything, isn’t it? That is perfectly true, and I thought you would say something like this just to punish me for caring about any one’s interests. It is always the way.”</p>
<p>She pouted and turned aside. He was silent.</p>
<p>“Very well, Mr. Roger, I am sorry I stopped you—and I—I won’t trouble you again.”</p>
<p>Her handkerchief was flourished and she appeared to be about to depart.</p>
<p>“O stop, stop, Miss Fletcher! Really I don’t know what to say. It is so very kind of you—but then it is so very wrong, not to speak of the danger, for you to act as a spy on your father for the benefit of his opponents.”</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Roger, you have cured me, sir I ” said Miss Fletcher, drawing herself up with dignity; “and next time I choose a confidant, I will take care he is a gentleman.”</p>
<p>Roger grew very red, and if the truth could have been told at that moment he was only wishing some man would say such a thing as that to him. From a girl it was terribly cutting, but there was no retribution possible unless he took her in his arms and kissed her, and he did not want to do that.</p>
<p>“Stay,” said Roger, catching hold of Miss Fletcher’s hand and grasping it so tight in his huge fingers that it nearly made her scream out, and yet she was delighted—“fearfully delighted,” as Dryden says. “Stay. We must not part bad friends. I do not forget your kindness. Miss Fletcher—perhaps I owe my life—a worthless article enough—to you. (<i>A squeeze</i>.) It may be your kindness has made me over-frank—but I was speaking as a friend—a big brother as it were—and you must forgive me if I have said anything to hurt your feelings. Really—I would not do so—not for the world.”</p>
<p>This was most delightful to Amelia—though in reality David had no more idea of sentiment in this gallant speech, than if he had addressed it to a marble statue or to Bathsheba.</p>
<p>“Oh! we shall understand each other,” cried Miss Fletcher with premature confidence. “No matter where I got the information. Please go and tell Mr. Latouche that there is to be an election and that it was arranged last night that Mr. Spriggs was to stand: and they think Doctor Jobson is the only man in the neighbourhood who could stand with any chance, but they don’t believe he will come out. There, Mr. Roger. Please say good-bye. I am going to take tea with the Smithsons a mile further on, and am very late already. Don’t tell a soul you have seen me. Good-bye!”</p>
<p>She squeezed his hand with all her energy, but he was thinking of something else and did not notice it. He took off his hat, and mechanically bid her good-day.</p>
<p>“What a dear old stupid he is!” exclaimed Miss Amelia as she slily took advantage of a turn in the road to watch the broad form of the schoolmaster striding along. He never thought of looking back. He was pondering the news he carried, and her personality was, for the time at least, merged in the large current of thought that, like the river below him, ran and eddied in his mind.</p>
<p>The genius of Latouche had not yet found its limits. When the news of the impending election was generally known in Cornwall, and Mr. Spriggs’s candidature was a settled fact, Councillor Latouche quietly left town. He disappeared without giving any of the usual intimations to his friends. Mrs. Latouche professed to be ignorant of his whereabouts; his clerks were quite as unable to answer for their master. He had no cases in Brockville or Toronto, and no one was aware that he had business in Montreal. The rumours in the parlour of Mr. Spriggs’s hotel were vague and contradictory. Some said he had been seen going up to Dickenson’s landing, doubtless with the intention of crossing to the “States”; and one <i>canard</i> was that he had had a misunderstanding with his wife and run away altogether. Podgkiss had already passed the joke that it was like “Junius deserting Dido.” Podgkiss was once more secure in his classics, since Roger now never entered the door of the Cornwall Arms.</p>
<p>Neither Councillor Jewett nor Mr. Spriggs believed any of the reports that were current about Mr. Latouche. They had too high an opinion of him to think that he would make a fool of himself in any way, and they expressed to each other the uncomfortable feeling that “Latouche was up to some tricks.”</p>
<p>They were not wrong.</p>
<p>One morning, a week after the lawyer had been missed, he appeared in his spring buggy with a brisk pair of horses, fairly spattered with mud, driving fast down Pitt Street. There was a significant smile on his keen face. By his side there sat a sedate-looking man, with rough features, a long under-jaw and a pair of grey eyes, which seemed to look well about them, and take stock of things as he went along. They drove, we say, down Pitt Street, turned at the foot, into Water Street, passed the Court—house, and so on to Councillor Latouche’s residence.</p>
<p>Spriggs, standing in his doorway, noted the wagon and its inmates, and for some reason or other, which at first he could not explain to himself, he experienced an unpleasant sensation. His sharp eye looked hard at the stranger and then his face assumed a puzzled expression.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen that man before, somewhere,” he said to himself, “I wonder who he is?”</p>
<p>Suddenly light flashed into his features; he slapped his forehead with his hand and sticking his thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat, darted across the street to Councillor Jewett’s office.</p>
<p>“Sold again!” he cried. “Latouche is back, and Macrea of Toronto is with him.”</p>
<p>Jewett knew in a moment what that meant.</p>
<p>An hour later Latouche entered Doctor Jobson’s room. He was cordially greeted and his manner indicated that he felt pleased with himself.</p>
<p>“It is all right Doctor, I thought I could do them.”</p>
<p>Doctor Jobson looked up inquiringly.</p>
<p>“Where have you been?” he said.</p>
<p>“To Toronto. I have secured the Agency of the Bank of Upper Canada in this district, and, my dear sir, we can have all the money we want.”</p>
<p>The Doctor breathed a great sigh of relief. The sharp lawyer then knew how heavily this matter had lain on his friend’s mind. He felt it more thoroughly when Jobson left the room and returned with Marian, who in warm and graceful terms congratulated the lawyer on his success.</p>
<p>“The manager has come down with me to make all the arrangements,” he said, highly gratified. “And now Jobson, d— it, we will go in and win the election. Forgive me for swearing, my dear madam, but really how could one do justice to one’s feelings in any other way?”</p>
<p>“I forgive you this once with great difficulty, sir! How much will the election cost, Mr. Latouche?”</p>
<p>“Oh! it won’t cost your husband more than three thousand dollars. I will undertake to get the rest subscribed.”</p>
<p>“O my poor boys! They will never get to Cambridge!” cried the lady.</p>
<p>“No: and a good thing for them, my dear madam,” replied Latouche. “Bring a man up for Canada in Canada. I never saw an English University fellow worth his salt out here, and for my part I really never could make out how he could be at home. Scotch University men get on very well, and so do some of our men, but your Oxford and Cambridge men are the biggest noodles turned out under God’s heaven. What a fool I should have been if I had been educated at Cambridge.”</p>
<p>“Latouche is clever,” said Mrs. Jobson, when he had gone away, “but he is very prejudiced and very narrow-minded.”</p>
<p>Doctor Jobson laughed.</p>
<p>“The truth is,” said he, “that Latouche is both right and wrong.”</p>

<!-- CHAPTER I.<br>SATURDAY MARKET -->
<p>It was a July evening, and the declining rays of the sun beat like red-hot strokes upon Charlotte’s Buildings. In the Buildings from six to eight hundred people stewed and panted, at doors and windows, upon beds, chairs and sofas. Some of the children lay asleep on the floor, with their little cheeks pressed to the boards, and their limp, moist hands and feet stretched, palms out, soles uppermost. They had dispensed with every bit of dispensable clothing; the boys had on only tattered shirts and torn breeches, the girls ragged dresses over rags of petticoats, and the babies apologies for shifts, frocks and pinafores. Some of the elder children were out in the court, a piece of ground which stretched from one end of Charlotte’s Buildings to the other. A group of small maidens sat there, under the wall of the Mint, rocking their bodies slowly backwards and forwards, fanning themselves with their pinafores, and singing an East End ditty—</p>
<div>
<p>“My Mary Anne<br>
Does the best she can:<br>
Keeps a shop for lollipop,<br>
My Mary Anne.”</p>
</div>
<p>A batch of little boys played ball against the washhouses; screamed, fought, and kicked, while the perspiration streamed from their faces and dropped in beads from their foreheads. A batch of bigger boys watched them, smoked the ends of cigars they had picked up in the streets, or twisted strings of spoiled tobacco into cigarettes. Occasionally a mother sallied forth to call in her progeny, to scold a girl or cuff a boy; but the maternal voices were drowsy, and the maternal strokes were languid, owing to the sultry weather.</p>
<p>Charlotte’s Buildings were, at that time, about two years old. They had been built by a company of gentlemen to hold casuals. The greater number of people who lived in them thought that they belonged to a company of ladies.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>“Because they are built cheap and nasty,” said the men. “Women don’t understand business. Depend upon it, some West End ladies fluked money in them.”</p>
<p>“Because ladies collect the rents,” said the women. “Men favour men; women favour women.”</p>
<p>The outward and visible signs of government were manifest to the tenants in the form of lady-collectors. Several times in the week ladies arrived on the Buildings armed with master-keys, ink-pots, and rent-books. A tap at the door was followed by the intrusion into a room of a neatly-clad female of masculine appearance. If the rent was promptly paid the lady made some gracious remarks, patted the heads of the children and went away. If the rent was not forthcoming the lady took stock of the room (or rooms), and said a few words about the broker. The Buildings were, in fact, under petticoat government, which, like everything else in this world, has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>“She takes the bread out of man’s mouth, and spends on one woman what would keep a little family,” grumbled a tenant to his neighbour, as the rent collector passed briskly along the balcony.</p>
<p>“I pity her husband,” responded the neighbour. “She’ll have the stick on him if he comes home a bit boosy.”</p>
<p>“Females like ’er don’t marry,” mumbled a misanthropic old lady.</p>
<p>The Buildings were not beautiful to look upon; they might even have been termed ugly. Their long yellow walls were lined with small windows; upon the rails of their stiff iron balconies hung shirts, blankets and other articles fresh from the wash-tub. Inside their walls brown doors opened into dark stone passages; and narrow winding staircases led from passage to passage up to the roof.</p>
<p>“I suppose rich people think they’ll keep us from coming nigh ’em by packing us close like this,” said an old Irish woman.</p>
<p>Whatever the rich thought about it the poor liked the Buildings; at any rate, they liked them for a time, just as rich people enjoy hotel life for a season. The children played about the court, the mothers gossiped in the doorways, the men smoked and talked politics on the balconies. Moreover, the rooms were cheaper than ordinary lodgings, and if the tenants were “kept under” by female despots, the despots were kind enough. Many a sick baby was cured, many a girl was sent to service, many a boy was started in life by the ladies who collected the rents. Some tenants grumbled against petticoat government, but others liked it; and all agreed that “an eddicated female” was a phenomenon to be much watched, criticised and talked about.</p>
<p>On the one side the Buildings faced Wright Street, on the other the Mint. Four tall chimneys and a huge reservoir were constantly before the eyes of the tenants. Inside the reservoir rain, hail, snow, fog, thunder, and lightning were made. So said the children. If anyone asked who had taught them these doctrines they answered, “We learned them ourselves.” In this reservoir the stars slept, into its depths the sun disappeared, out of it came bits of moons and whole ones. So said the babies. Of course this creed disappeared with babyhood, but like babyhood it faded imperceptibly, no one knew how or when; alphabet and blackboard drove it away, and the schoolboys and schoolgirls smiled contemptuously when they heard it lisped by their little brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>A great many of the tenants were Roman Catholics, so their children went to a school on the other side of the railway-bridge which faces Wright Street. Tiny two-year-old creatures were carried under the bridge and deposited in a big room like a nursery. There they were taught to sing “God Bless the Pope,” to answer, “Nicely, thank you, father,” when the priest asked his usual question, “Well, babies, how are you?” and to say their prayers with the Sister’s rosary. The bigger children were drafted into boys’ and girls’ schools, when, under the superintendence of Fathers and Sisters they learned to read, write and do arithmetic, to sing by note, so that they might join in the annual service at the Crystal Palace, and to become good Catholics.</p>
<p>By profession the tenants were nearly all “casuals,” dock-labourers, Billingsgate porters, hawkers and costermongers. A few superior people were scattered about the Buildings, but casuals occupied the greater number of the rooms; people who had no fixed rate of wages, who made a good deal one day, and next to nothing the day after. The wives of these men added to the family income by charing, tailoring and sack-making, besides doing all the housework. They were little better than beasts of burden, poor things, for East End husbands have but a low opinion of the weaker sex.</p>
<p>“I’m yer husband, ain’t I?” is their invariable answer to any complaint, which means, “I can knock you over if I like.”</p>
<p>The July evening of which I speak happened to be a Saturday—the hardest day of all the week for East End wives and mothers. To rise early and go to bed late was the Saturday rule for women in the Buildings. They must clean their “place,” get the children’s clothes ready for Sunday, scrub, cook, and bake, whilst boys and girls hung about and husbands did nothing. Little wonder that public-houses enticed them on their way back from market. A glass of something took their thoughts off troubles, drove away headaches, and lifted the cloak of monotonous toil for a few minutes. Alas! one glass was never enough. They began with beer—and ended with spirits.</p>
<p>About six o’clock that evening a girl came out upon the first balcony, waved her hand to the children, and disappeared down the staircase into the street.</p>
<p>“There’s Nelly!” cried a chorus of little voices.</p>
<p>“There goes the masher,” said a young man, taking his pipe out of his mouth while he spoke, and craning his neck to watch the girl as she walked quickly along Wright Street.</p>
<p>“’Er mother was a lady’s maid,” he explained to a new-comer. “That’s why she fancies ’erself.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile Nelly had reached Abel Street, and stopped to examine herself in a shop window. She wore no hat or bonnet, only a black shawl and a black dress. On her arm she carried a large market basket. She put the basket down for a minute and smoothed the red-brown hair which lay against her low, white forehead. About her face and neck were the blue shadows which usually accompany auburn tresses. These blue shadows are wonderfully pretty to look at. They play about the white skin as sunbeams play about the red-brown hair. They vary in colour from light blue to violet as the hair varies in tint, from ruddiest gold to palest yellow. They fade when the hair loses its gloss, and disappear altogether when their owner sees the first grey hair in her looking-glass. Nelly did not notice the shades or the tints, she was only conscious of a pair of hazel eyes with long black lashes, a nose of no particular shape, and a mouth like her mother’s. She smoothed her hair, put her shawl straight, and hurried along to market.</p>
<p>The people in the streets were enjoying their Saturday “out.” Brass bands played at the doors of public-houses; and men danced with their sweethearts. Strains of music came through swinging-doors, sailors performed hornpipes on the thresholds of gin-shops, and the friends of poor Jack lounged against walls with their arms a-kimbo.</p>
<p>Nelly took no notice of anybody or anything; she looked neither to the right nor the left, but walked quickly towards the market. Her mind was completely occupied by the fact that she was going to buy a new feather for her Sunday hat. Should the feather be red or blue? Blue suited her best, but red looked the smartest. She had but one ambition in dress, that was to wear something “stylish.” “To look like a lady,” she called it; and the sort of lady she admired was the only lady with whom she had ever come in contact, a friend in a West End place of business. To sit on a sofa, to read a novelette, to sip coffee with a teaspoon, to have someone to put on and take off her boots, was her idea of being a lady. Her friend only did these things on Sunday; a real lady did them every day of the week. To ride in a carriage was to be a <em>great</em> lady, Nelly thought. To mimic this blissful state she strove her uttermost, during the odd minutes she had to spare, and with the few pence she could save from the housekeeping. To-night she would buy a feather to put in her hat; and to-morrow she would spend hours trying to make it look “stylish.”</p>
<p>She reached the market, and went first of all to a butcher’s shop, where she bought a small bit of beef. Then she purchased some potatoes from a greengrocer, who called out “Buy, buy, buy,” in a stentorian voice, when the loitering multitude fingered his goods instead of producing money out of their pockets. Nelly put the meat and the potatoes into her basket, and paused to look at the long rows of trucks covered with fish, meat, and vegetables. She counted the money in her little knitted purse, slipped a half-penny into the hands of a blind beggar, and made her way to a stall holding artificial flowers, feathers, ribbons, and lace. A smart young man exhibited these wares, twirled them round and round in his fingers, and advised customers to buy articles upon which he made no profit, which he sold “dirt cheap” for their benefit. Nelly lingered a long time by his stall. She admired everything; but not one of these things was quite what she wanted. In vain the young man gave her the benefit of his advice—told her which was the latest thing out, showed her the sweetest thing in feathers, the cheapest thing in lace, she could not make up her mind, and would not let him make it up for her.</p>
<p>“I’ll go to Petticoat Lane to-morrow morning,” she said aloud, much to the young man’s disgust. “Maybe I’ll see there what I want.”</p>
<p>With a nod she left him, and turned her steps towards home, only stopping to buy a penny-worth of sticky stuff from an old woman at a corner-shop. She had the Sunday dinner in her basket, and the potatoes made her arm ache; but she walked fast, in spite of the weight, and did not stop until she reached the railway-bridge opposite Wright Street. There she went into a Catholic church, crossed herself, stowed her basket under a seat, and knelt down to tell her beads. Father O’Hara was repeating “Hail, Mary” in the pulpit. His strong voice rose and fell loud enough for the people to hear it, although a barrel-organ was playing a tune out in the street.</p>
<p>“O my little darling, I love you,” said the hurdy-gurdy.</p>
<p>“Hail, Mary, full of grace, blessed art thou among women,” said the priest, heedless of secular thoughts and noises, intent upon saving his soul, which he found a difficult business. Some priests flee the world, some the flesh, some the devil. Father O’Hara had run away from the demon Unbelief. He had looked into the yawning pit of Doubt, and had turned back shuddering. Since that time he had wrapt his intellect up in a napkin, and on the Day of Judgment he would say to the Deity, “Here is Thy talent. I was afraid to use it.”</p>
<p>The church had grown dark by the time Father O’Hara left the pulpit. He stood for a minute before the altar, under the red lamp; there he bent his knee, and gave the benediction. A few minutes later the service was finished, and the congregation went slowly out of church. Nelly took up her basket, and dipped her fingers in the shell of holy water fastened against the wall of the entrance. She held out her hand, before she crossed herself, to a lame girl who came down the chancel, carrying a bottle.</p>
<p>“What have you got in that bottle?” she asked, as they walked side by side down the church steps.</p>
<p>“Lourdes water,” answered her companion.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” inquired Nelly.</p>
<p>“Holy water. Father Gore brought it from Lourdes last week,” replied the lame girl.</p>
<p>“Lourdes!” exclaimed Nelly. “Where’s that?”</p>
<p>“A long way off, somewhere in France,” said the other with a heavy sigh. “Our Blessed Lady cures folks who go there to use the water. It cost twenty pounds to go and come back. Twenty pounds!”</p>
<p>“That’s a lot,” said Nelly.</p>
<p>By this time the two girls were passing under the railway-bridge, which had no lamp. It was very dark, so Nelly linked her arm in that of her lame friend until they reached Wright Street. Directly they came in sight of the Buildings a crowd of little boys and girls ran to meet them, shouting:—</p>
<p>“’Ulloa, Nelly! What have you got in your basket?”</p>
<p>Nelly sat down upon the first flight of stone steps she came to, and the children crowded round her. She slowly opened the lid of the basket, and showed them the bit of beef.</p>
<p>“Measly,” remarked a small girl, looking critically at it. “Fourpence three-farthings the pound.”</p>
<p>“’Tain’t measly,” cried a little boy. “Do yer think Nelly ’ud buy measly meat?”</p>
<p>He squared his fist, but before his wrath could vent itself he caught sight of the sticky stuff in the basket, among the potatoes. He began to execute a sort of war dance, in which the other children joined, while Nelly broke the sweet with a stone. Then she threw it up in the air, whence it fell into a dozen little dirty hands and open mouths; and with a laugh she ran upstairs to the first balcony, where a door stood half open. Pushing through this door, she came into a room fitted up as a shop. A long board, supported by boxes, ran from one end of the room to the other; and on this stood pots of jam and jars of treacle, the contents of which were sold at a penny the spoonful. Sugar, pepper, mustard, and other such condiments occupied holes in shelves fastened against the wall nearest the window; and in the window, on a ledge which slanted upwards, were sweets of all sorts and descriptions, toothsome brandy balls, huge peppermints, with appropriate mottoes; green, red, and yellow drops, chocolate, toffee, and new-fangled sugar-plums, which have not been christened yet. A pile of wood lay in one corner of the room; and by it, on a three-legged stool, sat an elderly woman, who was tying it up in bundles. She had a thin, peevish face; she wore an old black silk bonnet, a print body, a stuff skirt, and a large apron. Close to her, in a wooden arm-chair, sat a young man, smoking a short clay pipe. He was of the ordinary East End loafer type; he had a head shaped like a bullet, small round eyes, red hair cropped short, and a thick neck. He wore a bit of red flannel round his neck, fustian trousers, and a shabby brown coat.</p>
<p>“You’ve been gone long enough,” grumbled the woman, as Nelly came into the shop. “My back’s nigh breaking a-doing of these sticks. Take the jug, and look sharp.”</p>
<p>“Can’t Tom fetch the beer to-night?” inquired Nelly, looking while she spoke with some disgust at the young man in the armchair.</p>
<p>“Who’s to mind the shop if I fetches it?” asked the loafer. “She’s too grand a lady for us, ain’t she, mother?”</p>
<p>Nelly said not another word. She put down her basket and took up a jug, with which she ran downstairs to the end of Wright Street. There she found a small public-house, where she bought some ale, enough to make the froth run over upon her dress. She returned to the shop, placed the jug beside her mother, threw another glance of disgust at her brother, and went silently into an adjoining room. This was a bedroom. It had in it a bed, a table, a few chairs and a horse-hair sofa. Upon its walls hung funeral cards in small black frames, and pictures of saints in large gilt ones. Opposite the fireplace was a shelf, holding an image of the Virgin Mary, two brass candlesticks and a small bottle of holy water. Above the fireplace was Nelly’s friend and companion—a long narrow piece of looking-glass.</p>
<p>No sooner was the door between the bedroom and the shop shut than Nelly went to a box and took out her Sunday hat. She put it on, and, standing on tiptoe, looked up at the glass. In the glass’s company she soon forgot her visit to the public-house, which had wrinkled her forehead and brought a line between her eyebrows. She became lost in thought. To-morrow she must buy a feather in Petticoat Lane Market; to-night she must decide whether it should be red or blue. Blue suited her best; but red was so stylish—so very stylish.</p>

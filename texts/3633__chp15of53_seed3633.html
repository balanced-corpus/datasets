<p>We landed at Port of Spain, the principal town of the island of Trinidad, and which was, at that time, moat unlike what it is at present. It was then a straggling town, composed of wooden houses; yet its stores were crowded with rich merchandise, for commerce shed her golden smiles upon the island. We landed on a Sunday; but there was not the slightest appearance of that respect for the Sabbath which I observed in Antigua, although the Sunday market was, at that time, common to every town in this part of the world.</p>
<p>The bustle or this place astonished me; as did also the mixed hue and costume of the population, and Babylonish variety of tongues. Here strutted the gaudy officer of militia; for there had been a parade that morning, and almost every man in the island is in the militia, — there being a colonel, and a more than proportionate number of majors, captains, and subalterus, to every fifty men. There lounged, but in less pomp, an officer of the line; here and there rolled along a naval ofticer; the gaily dressed Spaniard shewed his laced frill and gold buttons; and the plainly dressed Englishman, with his nankeen jacket and jean trousers, stood beside the smart Frenchman, with his powdered hair, cue, short inexpressibles, silk stockings, and buckled shoes. Sometimes a Chinese or two would appear; and ever and anon an athletic and ferocious-looking mambo<sup><a href="#fn1">*</a></sup> would pass; together with groups of the mixed races between Indians, negroes, and Europeans, called Péons, — all wearing the dangerous <i>cuchillo</i> (knife, or poniard). Crowds of negroes walked to and fro, chattering, jesting, and laughing, as merrily as though slavery and degradation were blessioga; while here and there were numbers or tastily-dressed women, of the clasees called mulattoes, mestees, and quadroons, who were the most beautiful of those claasee which I, at that time, had ever seen.</p>
<p>The dialects of the people of Port of Spain were as mixed as their complexions and dresses. Chinese, corrupt Arabic, spoken by the Mandingo negroes; a hundred different vernaculars from Guinea; English, with its proper accent, and then with its creole drawl; Spanish, with its true Castilian pronunciation, as well as with the slight corruption with which the South Americans speak it; creole French, European French, Corsican, various kinds of <i>patois</i>, German, and Italian, were all spoken in this town.</p>
<p>But I have a more melancholy task to perform than that of describing the party-coloured inhabitants of Port of Spain. On Mr. Warner presenting me to Señor Tomaso, as the nephew of his late partner, that worthy man informed us that my uncle had died twelve days since, having neglected to make his will, as he believed; but the worthy Spaniard informed us, that he suspected an infamous conspiracy to have been entered into between Fanchinette, an <i>escribano</i>, or notary, named Gregorio Nunez, and four others, to deprive me of my uncle’s property. As these suspicions afterwards proved to have been too well founded, I will at once relate the particulars of the conspiracy.</p>
<p>Fanchinette and Nunez got up a <i>post mortem</i> will in the following ingenious, but by no means original method. After my uncle died, they placed his corpse in a chair, where it was supported by two of the conspiraton, whilst a third held the head from behind by the hair; Nunez then read a will, which purported to bequeath the whole of my uncle’s property to Fanchinette, at the end of every clause of which, the corpse was made to nod, as assenting; and, when the whole had been read, a pen wae placed in its cold hand, and its name signed to the paper.</p>
<p>The Spanish law, in force in the island, required seven witnesses to a will; but as Febrero (the Blackstone of Spain) says, that an escribano represents the Trinity, he therefore counts for three ordinary witnesses: thus, the oath of Nunez, and the affidavits of four other scoundrels, were sufficient to render the pretended will valid.</p>
<p>But the parties, to make assurance doubly sure, had caused a drunken Spanish priest; called Puablo Valdes, who had been chaplain to Apodaca’s ship, to marry Fanchinette to the said inanimate body. This marriage was managed in the following manner. Valdez they knew to be a priest incapable of doing a villanous act when in his sober senses, which, unhappily, was seldom the case; and, indeed, never after he had taken his dinner. He never drank before mass, in the morning; but what he took at night was sufficient to muddle him during the forenoon. Late in the afternoon, this priest was sent for, by which time he had taken his twenty-seventh glass of old rum and water. On his arrival, they informed him that my uncle George, on his deathbed, wished to make reparation to Fanchinette for having cohabited with her without leave of Mother Church, by marrying her, and requested that he (Valdez) would perform the marriage service. Now, occurrences of this nature often did take place in Old Spain; and hence the priest naturally believed what he had been told: and, moreover, Fanchinette and Nunez plied the unhappy man so plentifully with noyeau before the performance of the ceremony, that he might, perhaps, have seen an elephant were it within a few feet of him, but as for human beings, they were objects far too minute for his clouded vision. He was supported into the room where lay the corpse: he mumbled through the matrimonial service by rote, as reading it, from his state, was out of the question; and the next day he absolutely imagined that he had united, in the holy bands of marriage, George Arundell and Fanchinette La Roche.</p>
<p>To fill up the measure of her iniquity, two months after this event, Fanchinette declared herself with child by her late husband; and, nine months and two weeks after the death of my uncle, she gave birth to an infant. Thus it became a common saying in Trinidad, “that a dead man made a will, married a wife, and begot a child.” I have seen the infant of Fanchinette, which is as like the squinting, villanous-looking escribano, as one logger-headed shark is like another.</p>
<p>Señor Thomaso took a liking to me, and persuaded Mr. Warner to leave me with him: this the latter consented to do, provided my aunt at Antigua made no objections; and to this the old lady agreed. Señor Thomaso from some threatening expressions dropped by one of the witnesses of Nunez during a quarrel, threw the matter of the will and marriage into court; but, alas! it was a Spanish court of law. Enough evidence was obtained to throw a doubt to the authenticity of the will, and the validity of the marriage, but not enough to set them aside; at least so the lawyers said. These gentlemen made their pleadings so voluminous, that, long ere the cause was decided, the estate of my uncle was swallowed up by law-expenses. To give the reader some idea of the administration of justice in Spanish courts, I will relate the following fact. A barber who had, previously to its interment, shaved my uncle’s corpse, charged four dollars for the operation, and, like every debt owing by or to the succession of George Arundell, this demand was thrown into court, where the charges on it alone amounted to eight hundred dollars; which were paid out of my uncle’s estates, the judge, escribanos, and advocates, pocketing it all, and the poor barber getting nothing but the satisfaction of feeing his own lawyer. We have all heard of two cats, who found two pieces of cheese, and, disputing about their respective shares, applied to a monkey, who, in order to equalise them, piece by piece ate up the claims of both parties. If any human, or rather inhuman, tribunal resemble Jacko in the fable, it is a Spanish court of law.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Señor Thomaso sent me to a school in Port of Spain, where the English, French, and Spanish languages are taught <i>indifferently</i>, in both senses of the word. I had, naturally, great facility in acquiring languages; my knowledge of creole French made the study of good French easy, and, living with a Spanish family, I soon acquired a respectable knowledge of the Castilian tongue.</p>
<p>I must now pause in my personal narrative to relate a public event, which, however, was fated to have an influence on my own fortunes. About this time, the island was kept in a state of alarm by frequent rumours, and official accounts, of a strong French and Spanish fleet being in the West Indies. Here they efFected no conquest, for this they had no time to attempt; but they levied contributions on different islands, some of which they had not time to receive, ere they heard that the hero of the Nile was in pursuit of them: they started away without pocketing the booty they were on the point of receiving at Barbadoes. The very name of Nelson made them fly, although they had twenty-one sail of the line, and he but ten.</p>
<p>At length, however, the fleet of Nelson did appear off the northern coast of Trinidad. There was an old Spanish fort on an eminence, at the place called Las Cuevas, garrisoned by a few black troops, and commanded by a French emigrant in the English service. Nelson attempted to communicate with this little fort, but the Frenchman could not understand his signals; on which the admiral despatched two or three boats for shore, when the Frenchman, well knowing the fort could not be defended, spiked his two guns, pitched them into the sea, blew up his little fortress, and set off to town,<sup><a href="#fn2">*</a></sup> there spreading a report that the enemy’s fleet were in sight. On Nelson’s part the mistake was mutual: seeing the fort destroyed, he naturally concluded the enemy were in possession of the island. He had long been in search of the combined fleets, and he hoped he had now, at length, caught them. He accordingly sailed into the Gulf of Paria, with the hope of making the mouths of the Oronoke as famous in history as he had rendered those of the Nile. Certainly, no part of the world possesses a sheet of water better adapted for the collision of hostile navies than the Gulf of Paria. Two fleets encountering in this gulf must fight, without hopes of the defeated party escaping: it affords a fair <i>sea</i> and no favour.</p>
<p>On Nelson discovering his mistake, he scarcely waited to explain — he merely sent on shore a commissary, named Whitmore, a passenger from Barbadoes to Trinidad, with a hasty letter to the governor, to which he awaited no reply, but sailed away in pursuit of the enemy. Such was the decisive promptitude of him who, a few months after, fell gloriously in the arms of victory at Trafalgar.</p>
<p>On the false alarm of the French fleet being in sight taking place, three guns were fired, and a red flag hoisted upon every fort in the island — a signal that the colony is placed under martial law. Immediately all was bustle and confusion in every street of Port of Spain; drums rolled, fifes squeaked, and bugles brayed; in every house was heard the ringing of iron ramrods in the barrels of their muskets; the clattering of sabres in their steel cases; the clicking of pistols; the reports of every kind of fire-arm; and the clanking of the horses of the cavalry, mounted infantry, officers, and aides-de-camp, as they galloped to and fro.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the whole of the militia tamed out to a man, and assembled on the parade-ground, there awaiting the orders of General Heslop, who was at this time governor and commander-in-chief. The general rightly judged the capital to be indefensible, and therefore ordered all the merchant-shipping to anchor under Fort George, an unfinished fortress, situated on a high and steep hill, near the sea, about four miles from Port of Spain. He recommended the inhabitants to send their most valuable effects up to the fort, whither he despatched the greater part of the militia and troops of the line. This was the best thing that could have been done, had the alarm been true, for the town was indefensible; but the fortress, garrisoned by all the disposable force of the island, and well provisioned, could not easily be reduced. It commanded all the roads to town; so that the capture of the latter, while Fort George held out, would be little acquisition to the enemy, in a military point of view.</p>
<p>All were in haste to send their valuable property up to the fort: carts, mules, &c. were employed to transport money to it; merchants’ books, and public records, were sent up on the heads of negroes. Scarcely was the steep road cleared of those passengers, ere the militia began their march, commanded by officers who shewed more zeal than discretion; hurrying their men up the steep path, or permitting them to hurry themselves up, in double-quick time, although the thermometer was at ninety in the shade — but no part of the winding and precipitous road <i>was</i> shaded. The men were clothed and accoutred in heavy marching order, although only citizen-soldiers, and consequently unused to military fatigues. To complete the whole of these absurdities, they were marched in subdivisions, instead of ranks of four, so that the road was unnecessarily crowded. This ridiculous march caused the death of many men.</p>
<p>My worthy friend, Señor Thomaso, went out with his company — he being a captain in the militia; and I, as well as I could, ran by his side. Like most Spaniards in this part of the world, he possessed a broad leathern belt, for the purpose of secreting specie about his person in times of public danger, which belt I saw him fill with doubloons ere he set out, and brace round his body over his shirt. He was aged, and rather corpulent: the road up to the fort being steep, long, and intolerably hot, ere he got more than two-thirds of the way he turned pale, complained of fatigue, and a few minutes after fell. The event created a little confusion: some privates removed him off the road, and placed him under the shade of one of that species of palm called <i>cocorite</i>, one man belonging to his company volunteering to keep guard over him. When, in a few moments, the whole of the militia had ascended above the spot where Señor Thomaso lay, in his fainting fit, the sentinel loosed his coat, waistcoat, and stock; knelt down to observe his captain, and then said to me, —</p>
<p>“My good lad, is this your father?”</p>
<p>I informed him he was not, but “my kind friend.”</p>
<p>“Then, for Heaven’s sake, my boy, run up to the fort, and get a little vinegar — it’s the only thing that will save Captain Thomaso’s life! Run, for the love of God!”</p>
<p>In an instant I rushed up the steep hill to the fort. I did not take the winding road, but, with the agility of a kid, scrambled through the bushes in a direct line.</p>
<p>Out of breath, I arrived at the garrison, where all was tumult; many of the men, from causes before stated, had fainted, and some were attacked with <i>coups de soleil</i>. In vain I implored for a little vinegar; no one could or would grant my request. At length I saw a surgeon, who was in attendance on the sick, and him I entreated to grant me that which I was told would save the life of my friend. He asked me what I wanted with vinegar? I told him the accident that had befallen Señor Thomaso. It appeared he knew the worthy Spaniard; and promised to go with me himself and see him, the moment he could give relief to those who were dangerously ill.</p>
<p>Two or three militia-men were attacked with apoplexy, from wearing the stock with which the British soldier is absolutely tortured in an intertropical climate, and the surgeon had to open their temporal arteries, which operations took up more time than I wished; but at length the doctor, hastily tying up his small case of instruments, and taking in his pockets a phial or two, bade me lead on, and followed me down to where lay Señor Thomaso. In a few minutes we arrived there; but, alas! he was beyond all human aid. There lay his corpse, with his little bag of Catholic relics suspended round his neck; but his gold cross and heavy belt of doubloons had disappeared — nor was the sentry to be found.</p>
<p>I thought not of the doubloons, nor of the sentinel, for grief overpowered my young mind. It appeared to me that all those who attempted to befriend me were doomed to death. I felt myself an orphan boy in a land where all things were strange, and all men were strangers to me. I wept until I thought my heart would break.</p>
<p>The next day, when the false alarm subsided, the relations of Senor Thomaso made inquiries as to who was the honest sentinel who had so kindly volunteered to guard their deceased relative. This was easily ascertained, nor was it difficult to conjecture what became of the doubloon-belt; but not one shadow of proof could be obtained to criminate the suspected thief, even before a court-martial. He said that he <i>voluntarily</i> watched his captain until he died; but that he neither <i>volunteered</i>, nor was ordered, to keep sentry over a corpse. And he further alleged, that the moment he found the captain was dead, he went up to his duties at Fort George. This statement he could not prove; but such was the confusion in the fort at the time of this occurrence, that the friends of Thomaso could not disprove it. On the whole, nobody believed this man innocent of stealing the belt, and yet no one could blame the court-martial, which unanimously acquitted him.</p>
<p>The same man, three years after this event, was very busy, during the conflagration of Port of Spain, in saving his neighbours’ goods, while his own house was burning, by which disinterested conduct he lost all he had in the world — at least he often said so: and yet, “such is the envy of this wicked world” (as the old women say), that there were not wanting those who asserted that he had plundered to the amount of many thousand dollars during this calamity. One thing is certain, — namely, that, a very little while after the fire, he rose like a phoenix from its ashes, and became a <i>respectable</i> merchant; respectable in the sense of the word as used by the witness in Thurtell’s trial, — “because he drove his gig.” This man is still alive, but his name I will not mention to those who are not and have not been inhabitants of Trinidad, as to them it would be useless; and to those who are, or have been in the colony, it would be needless.</p>

<!-- CHAPTER VXXIV.<br>THE PILLARS OF SAND. -->
<p>As the morning grew apace, the Arabs remarked, with alarm, that the sun did not rise with its usual brilliance, and we soon became aware of a sulphurous odour in the atmosphere, and a lurid redness in the south-west quarter of the sky. The keen sense of hearing peculiar to all savages enabled Khaled (whom I considered little better than one,) to detect the approach of something yet unseen. He blew his match, and adjusted his weapons, but soon after a troop of wild horses, of that peculiar breed which the Bedouins hunt for food, and take by means of traps hidden in the sand, passed us like a whirlwind. Their manes, long, loose, and never touched by a human hand, waved on their necks like curling smoke; their eyes shot fire, and, straining every muscle, nerve, and energy, they swept on, diminished to specks, and vanished in the remote wastes beyond the blue horizon.</p>
<p>They were flying before the south-west wind! In the winter season this is always insupportable in those deserts, and by the time it reaches Mecca, after having passed over the mighty waste of burning sand, is nearly as bad as the simoom, for at times a single gust will suffocate both men and horses.</p>
<p>A thin and subtle dust filled the air, and the increased heat of the atmosphere rendered distension of the lungs almost impossible; thus our breathing became short and difficult.</p>
<p>A storm in the desert was at hand, yet my three captors marched doggedly on, with all the solemn apathy of Orientals, who confidently believed, as the Koran teaches, that the <i>destiny</i> of each man was bound unto his neck; that if they were to escape the dangers of the waste, and reach the great oasis, where their fortress stood, it was the will of Heaven; and if they were to perish, it was also the will of Heaven, and there was an end of it; for they confidently believed it was as impossible to add one hour to the allotted term of human life as to add one inch to their stature, by any art that cunning could devise. They smiled grimly, as a cry of astonishment and alarm escaped me, for now the greatest terrors of the desert arose before us.</p>
<p>In the south-west quarter of the heavens, I saw three mighty columns of sand arise from the bosom of the plain; they wavered and vibrated, as their vast bulk was agitated and borne on <i>towards us</i> with a speed which the swiftest racer could not have outrun. The sky seemed to darken as they approached, towering between us and the sun, and casting three long purple shadows, across the yellow sand—shadows that had no termination but at the horizon—while the sun itself added to their mysterious terrors by giving them the hue and aspect of stupendous pillars of fire alternating between purple, gold, and russet-brown; and now a rushing, hissing sound swept over the sea of sand, as if the whole earth was passing away with them.</p>
<p>On, on they came, these terrible phenomena, apparently about a mile apart, but rushing straight towards us.</p>
<p>The poor camel planted his fore-feet firmly in the sand, and thrust his head and nostrils as far down into it as possible, refusing to advance a step, and in vain did Khaled drag him by the bridle and prick his flanks with a lance. One of the Arabs became frantic with terror, and rent his turban, crying,</p>
<p>“Malediction on thee, Khaled Ibn Khobaid, for thou hast destroyed us; and on that day when seventy thousand chains, each dragged by seventy thousand angels, shall drag all Hell to the presence of the Prophet, may he judge between thee and us!”</p>
<p>“May your mothers suckle devils,” growled Khaled, looking after the two, who, by an impulse they could not resist, fled to a distance—a hundred yards or so—to avoid the columns of sand; but, lo! one of these suddenly changed its direction, and poured all its strength, and volume upon the very place they occupied, and in a moment buried them for ever, under a mound which fifty men could not have cleared in many, many hours. A cry of horror burst from me, and I sprung towards it, dragging Khaled by the girdle, and saying,</p>
<p>“Let us save them if we can!—quick—quick!”</p>
<p>“Poor Kafir !” he answered, sullenly, “in another moment thou wilt thyself be in the flames of Al Sirat.”</p>
<p>But still I dragged him away, and we had not gone twenty paces when there was an awful hissing in my ears—a whirlwind of sand and darkness swept around us, as one column passed away over the desert, and the third entombed the heavily-laden camel, upon whom it discharged all its strength, and whose load of plunder had brought Ibn Khobaid on this disastrous journey.</p>
<p>So great was the sense of suffocation for some minutes, that I thought we would have expired upon the spot, where we had fallen flat with our faces on the hot sand. But now the last of these terrors had passed into the wilderness; the sun shone out clearly, and I turned to Khaled, who stood between the two mountains of sand, gazing at them by turns, as he leaned on his matchlock, and knew not under which of the pyramids his camel lay, and under which his kinsmen—both were so exactly alike. I thought there was a little motion in one of them, but it must have been fancy, or caused only by the last eddy of the fine sand whirling as it settled on the summit of the mound.</p>
<p>“Thou hast saved my life,” said Khaled, in a husky voice; “but of what value is it now? for under that sand, which none but a geni could move, lie two of my bravest kinsmen and all my wealth! It was the will of God, and Mahomed is his Prophet.”</p>
<p>He trembled in every limb; he was ghastly pale, for strange to say, the hot air of the desert had affected him even more than it did me. Now we were alone, and as I surveyed Khaled I remembered all the insults and humiliations to which he had subjected me. Two of my tyrants had perished.</p>
<p>“Ibn Khobaid,” said I, with a gloomy smile, “If one more pillar of sand comes this way, I may find myself free.”</p>
<p>“Thou art not yet free,” he answered, levelling his matchlock at me; “for having lost all else, makes me value now my slave the more. Nay, stand back,” he cried, with savage energy, perceiving that I was about to rush upon him; “if I shatter your legs by a bullet, you will be devoured alive by the same vultures that tore my camels to pieces this morning, and which, from afar, are doubtless now scenting us as the <i>next</i> victims; and, by the soul of the Prophet, and the bones of Khobaid, my father, I will fire, if you advance but the breadth of a hair towards me.”</p>
<p>The match smoked, and his right eye glared as he closed the left, and took deliberate aim at me. Under these circumstances and after such a threat, to advance would have been madness. I could only shake my clenched hand in his face, and inwardly resolve to <i>byde</i> my time, as we say in Scotland, for I felt assured that my time of retribution would soon come now.</p>

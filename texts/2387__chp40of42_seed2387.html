<p>“Who will not be persuaded that now at length the Great Judge of the world hath heard the sighs, and groans, and lamentations, hath seen the tears and blood of so many innocent men, women, and children, afflicted, robbed, reviled, branded with hot irons, roasted, dismembered, mangled, stabbed, whipped, racked, scalded with hot oil, put to the strapado, ripped alive, beheaded in sport, drowned, dashed against the rocks, famished, devoured by mastiffs, burned, and by infinite cruelties consumed, and purposeth to scourge that cursed nation, and to take the yoke of servitude from that distressed people as free by nature as any Christian.”—Sir Walter Raleigh.</p>

<p>It is reported, in dull official phrase, that Tupac Amâru took Alliaga prisoner by surprise, brought him to Tungasuca, kept him in durance for six days, provided him with a confessor, and otherwise gave the sinner time to “fold his soul up neatly, and direct it to God in Heaven.” Unofficial report states quite the contrary. There need be no conflict on the matter, since both reports are strikingly unanimous in their testimony to the one great event — that, the tenth day of November having come, Tupac Amaru caused a gallows to be put up in the market-place of Tungasuca, and on that gallows the Corregidor of Tinta, the representative of his Most Catholic Majesty the King of Spain, was hanged by the neck till he was dead.</p>
<p>Right in front of the gallows was the little whitewashed church of Tungasuca, and Tupac Amâru mounted the steps, and from thence (after that the negro, Antonio Oblitas, had unceremoniously thrust Don Antonio Alliaga from his firm footing, and left him to swing between earth and sky), he proceeded to address the assembled Indians.</p>
<p>“My children,” the Inca began, “there hangs the man who murdered the three chiefs, Rutabata, Pachamata, and Hunanata. He would have hanged me if he could; but I watched him closer than he knew of. There hangs the man who robbed you of your wives and daughters, and was robbing you day by day of your lives. Murderer, adulterer, and thief; disloyal to his king, and a traitor as well to God — I have hanged him to free you from chains, from starvation, and from death. From to-day there shall be no more slavery in mines or workshops, no more deaths from starvation, no more whips, no more hunting you down with dogs, no more branding, no more <i>repartos</i>, no more taxes on your food or on your heads. From to-day you shall live in your own homes, on your own soil, surrounded by your children, your relatives, your friends. Your own King shall rule over you. Your Inca has come back to you. I am he!”</p>
<p>He spoke in Quichua, and, throwing off a cloak which covered his person, he appeared dressed in royal blue velvet, gold embroidered, a gold chain round his neck, “from which did hang a large gold sun.”</p>
<p>Two servitors here came forward, bearing a crimson cushion, and upon it a sceptre of wrought gold, which they presented to the Inca, kneeling. He took it, kissed it, and held it up for all to see.</p>
<p>“Behold!” he cried, “the sceptre of the Inca. From to-day begins the reign of love.”</p>
<p>They then brought him a sword; unsheathing it, he cried—</p>
<p>“This is a Spanish sword; and represents Spanish justice. Only against Spanish oppressors shall it be drawn.</p>
<p>“To-day,” he exclaimed, raising his voice to its highest pitch, and the sword to arm’s length—”to-day the sun which shines on the deadly workshops of this old town, where I was born and you have toiled in sorrow and despair, shall shine on them no more.”</p>
<p>After this address, and the ceremonies of clothing and arming the Inca, the Spaniards declare that he went and heard mass. But the statement is not true. What did occur was the celebration of a very ancient Incarial rite. A gold cup, containing wine made from Indian corn, was brought to the Inca; small gold cups were also brought. The Inca, having drunk of the wine, poured it from the large cup into the small ones, which were handed to the chiefs or centurions, who, having sipped of the sacramental liquor, passed the cups round among the people, who likewise drank of it. The Inca held the larger vessel in his hands, and from it he replenished the smaller ones as they were brought to him by the centurions.</p>
<p>“The Inca!” “The Inca!” “The Inca!” exclaimed each Indian, as he drank of the wine.</p>
<p>“Yea, the Inca,” responded Tupac Amaru. “May his love always cheer your hearts as now this wine warms and strengthens your bodies.”</p>
<p>The observance of this ceremony had been insisted upon by the Princess Hilipa, who also wished that the Inca, when he should declare himself to the people, should wear the Inca robes; but, for his own reasons, he appeared in the dress of a Marquis of Spain. It was his right to do so.</p>
<p>The number of Indians now gathered together in the town of Tungasuca could not be less than five thousand men, and they continued to arrive in small groups of tens and twenties until past the hour of noon, at which time Alliaga had been hanging for more than three hours.</p>
<p>Up to this time the most marked silence reigned in Tungasuca. When Alliaga appeared on the scaffold not a human tongue wagged. He was hanged, and he died amidst the most dismal silence. There were thousands of people round about him, and not one opened his lips, even to curse him.</p>
<p>When the Inca threw off his cloak, and appeared in his magnificent clothes, and declared himself Inca, still not a voice was raised; and the Inca’s address was received with the same expressive reserve.</p>
<p><i>The greater part of that assemblage of swarthy human beings, nearly all young men in years, were deaf! Hundreds of ihem were dumb, many were more than half blind, all partially idiotic,</i> and the best of them in nothing better than over-driven cattle — perishing of hunger and thirst, their mouths filled with the dust of death — a sight to move the gods to tears.</p>
<p>This hideous discovery was made by Zagrazmit, who, when he told it the Inca, indecorously drew his sword, and swore a great oath in the English tongue that he —Zagra — would not sleep “until every damned Spanish den of a workshop where these poor souls had suffered such mortal terrors was burned to the ground.”</p>
<p>The Inca took off his Spanish blue velvet, and put on his homespun clothes. He brought “his children” into the church, but certainly not to hear mass. Every house was turned into a hospital. And while he is feeding the multitude with bread and wine, and making vast preparations for an universal hot supper, we will go with Zagrazmit and see how he fulfilled his vow.</p>
<p>The programme of the day’s proceedings had been much altered, the only part of it which was carried out being the hanging of the Spaniard. True, the Inca had declared himself. But, alas! he might as well have tried to make himself known to a flock of alpacas. It was his intention to set out that very afternoon for Cuzco; and could he have done so, even with his own armed men whom he had trained, he would infallibly have regained the ancient capital of the Incas. The Spaniards, then very few in numbers, would have been surprised, and the city easily taken and occupied with less than twenty thousand Indians. Above all, the recreant native chiefs who clung to the Spanish rule, and who had already more than once to cry to Spain for mercy, would have joined the Inca as the deliverer of their nation; and that ancient kingdom would have been delivered speedily from the bondage in which it lay.</p>
<p>It must have occurred to Tupac Amâru, as he threaded his way through the ranks of his emaciated Indians, that he had delayed his appearing too long. He had brought deliverance; but, alas! too late for the captives. He had slain the dragon, but not until it had mortally bitten everybody. It must have been on account of some such reflection that the Inca lingered all that day and through the night in Tungasuca, doing the work of the Samaritan, when he should have been sounding the trumpet of war.</p>
<p>This delay is accounted for by the royal chroniclers in another manner. Tupac Amâru, according to them, was still writing letters to the Spanish authorities, and vexing his soul because no answer came to them. He was in reality trying to save a lot of human souls who had been drowned in a sea of misery; he was giving bread and broth to the wretched, when he should have been spilling blood elsewhere.</p>
<p>Zagrazmit, who ought to have been made sole commander-in-chief on that day, had insisted upon all the Spaniards being seized, and detained at least, if not put to death, in company with Alliaga. But the Inca gave strictest orders that no Spaniard should be molested. When Zagra, therefore, and his avenging followers came to the first great <i>obrage</i> which they intended to demolish, of course they found no Spaniard there — they had all fled. Pisagua and his followers had fled, as a matter of course; and this time it will be no false rumour that shall enter and alarm Cuzco. For there will be a hundred frightened fugitives, all of Spanish blood, who will bear testimony to the hanging of one of their own sacred order and nation, and to other facts no less striking in connection with this <i>sublevacion</i> or uprising of the Indians.</p>
<p>When Zagra, therefore, came to the first large mill, he found it empty — at least, so he deemed it, for no one came out to answer his challenge. It was a long, lowr narrow building, made of rough stones and well thatched.</p>
<p>Zagra led the way into the den, but the stench he encountered on entering it sent him back; nor could he and his men pass into it until they had made two large openings in opposite walls, for the purpose of giving circulation to the cleansing, lifeyielding fresh air.</p>
<p>This loathsome sty contained several old people, who were chained to the walls. They were living skeletons, and had rather the appearance of huge bats than human beings. The explanation of this dreadful spectacle was that these old and worn-out objects were greatly beloved of their children and grandchildren, who refused to leave them when they were at home for the workshop. The Spaniard, therefore, took the aged, helpless people, and chained them up in the workshop, in order to keep their young relations at the looms. By this arrangement the Indian could kill two birds with one stone — namely, attend to his weaving, and minister to his aged and decrepid father and mother, or grandfather or grandmother, at the same time. In a corner was found an Indian woman, whose sole clothing was the dark colour of her skin, giving suck to a baby not much bigger than a man’s hand. Why, she, too, is chained to the wall! What may this mean?</p>
<p>Well, sir, she was a young woman belonging to the overseer — a sort of wife of his; and yesterday, after finishing a piece of work, she tore it all to shreds with her teeth, which was a dead loss, you know. So they stripped her naked and flogged her. She is to be flogged again to-day; and they will flog that old cripple, her mother, who is lying close by her on the floor, because she will feel that a great deal more than the flogging she gets herself.</p>
<p>“May God Almighty forgive me for knowing nothing of this infernal cruelty!” exclaimed the Englishman, as he went to get a piece of baize to cover the stricken woman.</p>
<p>There was plenty of food, plenty of cloth for everybody at this foul sink, but not for Indians.</p>
<p>“The more you fed and the better you clothed or cared for an Indian, the less work you got out of him,” was the firm faith of the owner of this “workshop.”</p>
<p>Zagrazmit and his men carried the captives out of the place into the house of the <i>obragero</i>, fed, clothed, and, as well as he might, comforted them. But he felt it to be “poor work.” He was ashamed of being a man, since there were men to be found capable of such fell outrage on humanity as he had that afternoon unearthed. He found himself about to exclaim, in a spirit of superior criticism — reflecting upon, whilst he hoped at the same time to rectify, “the ways of God to man” — “Can there be a God in Heaven who sees these things, and who yet withholds His arm?” but he changed his note, and he said aloud, “It shall be seen this day if there is alive on the earth a being worthy of the name of man.”</p>
<p>They burnt down the infamous factory, with its looms, and all their horrible gear. But it was very pitiful to see the rescued Indians’ expressionless faces; if they felt any joy for their deliverance, they had no power to show it. Even as their bones could no longer yield one drop of sweat, so their hearts, dried up with sighing, could not pump a little tear from the eye, or wreath the mouth with the faintest smile.</p>
<p>On that memorable afternoon of the tenth day of November, one thousand seven hundred and eighty, Zagrazmit and his Indians burnt down five large buildings — all of which presented the same fearful
aspect as this, the first they came to. They likewise recovered a thousand muskets, a good supply of gunpowder, and cloth enough to clothe an army. But there was not an available Indian to swell the number of fighting men. On the contrary, Zagra was compelled to tell off three or more of his own men for each den that was destroyed, in order to look after the famished wretches whom they found inside of it. All the Spaniards had gone. Not one remained to defend his property, or the life of their chief. It was well known afterwards that the Inca could have been easily overpowered and taken, had the Spaniards hung together and shown any pluck.</p>
<p>But it is evident that their unnatural crimes had eaten into their souls, and beggared them of courage. They fled down the steep hills like the angels that fell into hell, or like the swine that, possessed of the devils, rushed down the steep place into the sea, because, mainly, they could not stop themselves.</p>
<p>The reader has already seen one of these pitiable miscreants. Señor Don Antonio Asta de Cabras, who lost his ears and his reason on the slippery sides of the Cerro de Pasco, was the only one who had held up so far on his way to Lima, and, but for his meeting with those hostile Indians, would have conveyed the fearful tidings of the events then taking place in Tungasuca to the Viceroy.</p>
<p>Zagrazmit returned to the Inca with the spoil of the workshops, and recounted the scenes he had witnessed, and what he had done, and what he had felt, and what he had vowed, and how that all the Spaniards had fled, and that there was not left a single Indian capable of slinging a stone, or even walking a mile.</p>
<p>“Do we fire the beacon to-night, Inca?”</p>
<p>“Yea, Zagra, <i>che</i>, the beacon that shall set all this kingdom in a blaze must be fired this night, and by thee.”</p>
<p>“I will not fail,” was the response.</p>
<p>And about midnight a great and lurid flame poured itself into the air from the highest mountain in the range that rose above the town. But, at the first, even this messenger was slow to move, as if it had been bribed by time not to go off. The preparation of it had gone on for years; by slow and painful toil, the combustibles had been piled up, and bound together in one compact mass, waiting for the hour when it should burst into a torch of flame, heralding the dawn of liberty to the oppressed millions who groaned beneath the vilest yoke that vile man ever made for man. But the lighting of it had been delayed too long; there was no leap or spring in the kindled flames, and only towards the close of the burning, when the huge heap of wood had become thoroughly impregnated with fire, did the inspiring wind blow it into the vivid brightness which could command a response.</p>
<p>Zagra’s heart gave a bound as he saw the first answering beacon light up the distant sky. It was in the south. In the space of three hours he could report to the Inca that he had seen, with his own watchful and grateful eyes, fifty fires blazing on as many mountains, east and west, north, and in the loyal south. From the south only could any great strength come, and, thanks be to Heaven, the fires burned bright and steady there. Before the day should dawn, even as far as Buenos Ayres would the people be arming for the fight.</p>
<p>On the day following, the Inca and Zagrazmit, leading a small band of well-trained Indians, entered the valley of the Vilcumayo, and destroyed three or four large <i>obrages</i>, surprising their owners into precipitous flight, and collecting more muskets, gunpowder, and several hundred thousand dollars in silver, besides two pieces of artillery.</p>
<p>The Inca had not without reason fixed upon the winter time for his rising. The Indian could find his way in the snow where the Spaniard would perish. The Indian could march through a mountain storm where the Spaniard would be lost.</p>
<p>In forty-eight hours after the hanging of Alliaga, the Inca had roused into action all the great chiefs on whose help he could rely, throughout all the provinces of the south.</p>
<p>From Oruro the mystic cry was set up, “The Inca has come!” and the men from thence — the best that the Inca could command — went forth to meet him; and but for them the Inca would not have held his army together a single week. For they brought the fire of a religious enthusiasm to the work. No petty details of human sorrow could damp their ardour. They would not delay their glorious march to Cuzco for the sake of liberating a few wretches that had been reduced to the level of vermin in the workshops.</p>
<p>“To Cuzco!” was their cry — “the Inca has risen!”</p>
<p>It was on the afternoon of the tenth day after the revolt had begun, and the celebration of the Inca sacrament was taking place in a mountain village — the Inca making himself known to the Indians, and the Indians receiving him as their lord — that these mighty men from Oruro made their appearance.</p>
<p>The ever-vigilant Zagrazmit had noticed the approach of what seemed to be an army, and mentioned it to the Inca, who had the vision of an eagle; and in an instant, as he turned to look at the coming procession, the fashion of his countenance changed. Had they been angels from Heaven, bringing him by their presence the certainty of victory, he could not have been more strangely elated.</p>
<p>He descended the platform which had been erected in the Plaza for the occasion of the sacrament, and attended only by a few of his trusty Indians (not more than ten, as well as the faithful Zagra), he went on foot to meet the approaching host. On it came like a mountain torrent; but in compact military order. The Inca took up a position favourable to the marching past him of this real army. But when he was recognized by Toma Catari, that leader halted his men, and gave the signal for a royal salute. Then did twenty men bearing a palanquin, led by Toma, approach the Inca, and beg that he would mount the car and be carried in a manner worthy of an Inca.</p>
<p>The Inca, joyously happy, stepped into it, and was carried through the ranks of the chosen people; and the air was filled with such a shout of praise that seemed to make the very landscape partake of the prevailing joy.</p>
<p>The poor people of the little town hard by, made timid by hideous scourges and by miserable bodily suffering, could not at first enter into this glorious happiness; all pleasure had long ago been washed out, or kicked out, of them, and they were simply borne along out of themselves on the rapture of the men who, like a heavenly host, had come down to earth to teach them how to behave to their newly found King and lord.</p>
<p>This was, indeed, like a beginning. Had these white-robed, open-faced, nobly healthy, and gloriously happy people stood by the Inca on the tenth day of this same November instead of the twenty-first, there would have been more joy in Heaven than the recording angel will ever tell of.</p>
<p>The Inca was now taken possession of by his people. It was an honour to wash his feet. He was never allowed to walk or to ride when the army marched; he was always carried in the royal palanquin, and the Inca Indians carried joy and peace and blessing wherever they went. The walls of <i>obrages</i> fell down at the breath of their nostrils. Nothing could oppose them or stop their progress for a day. “To Cuzco,” was their constant, inspiring cry; and on they went, never once dreaming that the Inca would not bring them there in due time.</p>

<title>Chapter 49 of The Admiral’s Ward by Alexander</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">

<p>The weeks which ensued would have
been very pleasant to Laura but for
the <em>dénouement</em> hanging over her. She
saw Winnie frequently, and Reginald
scarcely at all. But she was gratified by observing
that the former seemed more tranquil and content ;
she looked better and fresher, and appeared to be
on more friendly and confidential terms with her
mother-in-law than formerly.</p>

<p>
Winnie—kindly, real, true—was always a frequent visitor in Leamington Road, and was ere
long entirely restored to the Admiral’s favour,
while she became A 1 in Mrs. Crewe’s estimation.
Reginald revolved between Pierslynn and London,
and no hint of the Polish Princess disturbed the
smooth surface of their lives.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile letters from Denzil cheered the hearts
of his mother and his <em>fiancée</em>. It was Laura’s first
love-letter, and, although a rational production, its
tone of deep tenderness, the details of his daily life
poured out with the confidence fond affection alone
can create, made her heart swell with pride and joy.
</p>

<p>
He was but a few days arrived when he wrote ;
yet he had already time to gather that although he
found matters in a bad state, they were less complicated than he expected. He therefore hoped to
finish his work in about six months, as his longing
to return to the home he knew awaited him grew
more intense the further he went from it.
</p>

<p>
This letter made Laura burn to tell him all the
events of the past few weeks, but she resolutely
resisted the wish. She would never betray Reginald to a man who had always, in her opinion,
undervalued him ; the name and fame of her old
love were precious deposits that should never be
breathed upon if she could help it. As Winnie’s
husband too, he was, if possible, to be preserved, and
lifted over the chasm which had suddenly opened
under his feet.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
One cold rainy afternoon in the first week of the
new year, Laura, on returning from her morning’s
walk, was greeted by Mrs. Crewe with the news
that ‘Mr. Piers was closeted with the Admiral ;
and mark my words, Laura, something extra-
ordinary has happened ! That poor young man
had quite a scared look.’
</p>

<p>
‘ Indeed !’ said Laura, affecting to be occupied
with her wet umbrella to avoid scrutiny. ‘I will
take off my hat, dear Mrs. Crewe, and join you
immediately.’
</p>


<p>
Was <em>the</em> moment come ? and if so, how would it
all turn out ? A strange sense of suffocation oppressed
her—her heart beat—she did not know how
to endure herself ; she dreaded to go downstairs,
yet she could not stay in the silence of her own
chamber. She left it, and was overtaken at the foot
of the stairs by the Admiral and Reginald, both
looking grave and disturbed.</p>

<p>
The latter shook hands with her silently, and
turning to the Admiral, said :
</p>

<p>
‘ I leave it to you, my dear sir, to communicate
this extraordinary discovery to Laura, and I leave
myself in your and her hands without fear.’
</p>

<p>
‘ You can with every confidence ; and may the
good God guide us for the best !’ returned the
Admiral solemnly.
</p>

<p>
‘ The matter will soon be public, there is no need
for secrecy,’ rejoined Reginald; and, shaking hands
with the Admiral, he hastily left the house.
</p>

<p>
The Admiral looked after him for a moment ;
then, taking Laura s hand, said impressively :
</p>

<p>
‘ I have a strange tale to tell you, my dear ; come
into the dining-room. Our good friend Mrs. Crewe
has a right to hear it also.’
</p>

<p>
It had come then, at last !
</p>

<p>
Laura, trembling in every limb, followed her
guardian, and Mrs. Crewe, who had caught the
words, ‘ strange tale,’ was metaphorically standing
on the tiptoe of expectation.
</p>

<p>
‘Do sit down, my dear sir, and tell us all about
it. You know if anyone is safe, <em>I</em> am.’
</p>

<p>
The Admiral did not heed her ; he stood by the
fire holding Laura’s hand in both his own.
</p>

<p>
‘ My dear child, it has pleased God to send you a
great, a totally unforeseen change of fortune. Your
cousin Reginald has just now told me that in looking
carefully through his predecessor’s papers, a
task he had too long postponed, he came upon a
packet labelled “Geoffrey Piers’ letters,” within
which was a second parcel carefully sealed. On
examination it proved to contain the certificate of
your grandfather’s marriage, some letters describing
that event, written by your grandmother, and some
other letters and papers, which prove, Reginald
says, beyond a doubt, that you are the real heir of
the Pierslynn estate, as you descend from the elder
brother of Reginald’s grandfather. This, of course,
if all turns out as he anticipates, will bring a terrible
reverse upon your relatives ; but Reginald, with the
decision of an honest man and a true gentleman,
lost no time in laying the documents before his
solicitors, who yesterday examined the register of
the church (somewhere in the City) where the
marriage is stated to have taken place, and there
they found an entry corresponding to the certificate.
Your father is thus proved legitimate. It requires
but a few formalities, therefore, to establish your
claim.’
</p>

<p>
He stopped ; and Laura, trembling almost visibly,
could hardly utter the words :
</p>

<p>
‘This seems incredible. I feel terrified at so
extraordinary a reverse.’
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Crewe could not restrain her excitement.
</p>

<p>
‘ <em>Laura</em> the owner of Pierslynn ! <em>Laura</em> the real
head of the family ! the ways of Providence are
past finding out. Why, my dear Admiral, no
romance in Mudie’s library can equal this. And
will the house and grounds, the carriages and the
horses, the — the pictures and the family jewels, all
belong to Laura ? I do not seem able to believe it ;’
and Mrs. Crewe rose from her seat and went to put
all the antimacassars straight as a sort of outlet to
her emotion.
</p>

<p>
‘ I can hardly believe it myself,’ said the Admiral,
still holding Laura’s hand and looking with some
anxiety into her pale agitated face. ‘ I am by no
means sure how we ought to feel in these strange
circumstances. It is a sore trial to Laura, it is a
terrible blow to Reginald Piers. Let us keep our
minds calm and anticipate as little as possible.
Messrs. Greenwood, Mr. Piers’ solicitors, have sent
down an agent to the village in Wales where
your father was born, to ascertain if his birth is
registered there, and how. Meantime, the deepest
source of regret and anxiety to Mr. Piers is that he
has spent so much of <em>your</em> money, as he calls it.
Not only three years’ income, but a large amount
of his predecessor’s savings. This is but natural.’
</p>

<p>
‘ I am sure, if this strange story proves true, he
need not distress himself about what he has spent.
<em>I</em> will never trouble him,’ cried Laura.
</p>

<p>
‘ So I ventured to assure him,’ said the Admiral
gravely, as he drew forward a chair for her. ‘ Such
unconscious appropriation carries with it neither
guilt nor blame.’
</p>

<p>
‘ I suppose not,’ said Mrs. Crewe, returning to the
fireplace and gazing with a profound air at the
comfortable blaze ; ‘ but, though I say it myself, I
can see a little more below the surface than many,
and it seems to me very extraordinary : first Mr.
Piers’ tremendous haste to marry our dear Laura
here, then the breaking of the engagement, then
this discovery. You see, if he had married you,
Laura, he would have still been master of Pierslynn,
whatever happened.’
</p>

<p>
‘ Oh, Mrs. Crewe !’ interrupted Laura in a tone
of genuine horror, for the suggestion terrified her.
</p>

<p>
‘ My dear Mrs. Crewe, said the Admiral, with
some severity, ‘you should not permit yourself even
to think so uncharitably, and I must add unjustly.
It was entirely in this man’s power to suppress and
destroy the evidence which robs him of his fortune.
When he discovered these documents he was alone
with his own conscience, visible only to the All
Seeing of whose presence I fear he is but little
mindful. Had he burned these papers he would
never have been found out, as no suspicion seems
to have existed that Geoffrey Piers ever married
the girl who was Laura’s grandmother ; in short,
and even to a man of principle, there was a certain
degree of temptation in such a moment. Reginald
has surmounted it. I trust for all our sakes, Mrs.
Crewe, you will abstain from such thoughts and
expressions.’
</p>

<p>
‘ You must know, my dear sir, that your wish is
law to me,’ returned that lady, unabashed. ‘ I do
not intend to express myself to the same effect
again ; but not being as good and holy as you are,
or as high-minded as our dear Laura, though I
should scorn a mean action, I am perhaps a better
judge of worldly matters than either of you. How-
ever, be my opinions what they may, I shall keep
them to myself.’
</p>

<p>
‘ To your opinions, dear Mrs. Crewe, you have
every right, only pray be careful in forming them ;’
then, turning to Laura, the Admiral continued :
‘Your cousin recommends that you should put
yourself in the hands of Messrs. Thurston and
Trent, as it is right they should prosecute inquiries
and see that everything is properly and legally
carried out. I therefore propose to accompany you
to their office to-morrow morning. Till then let us
try and divert our thoughts somewhat, for I cannot
yet quite believe that Reginald’s rights can be upset.
If any doubt remains, he says he will defend them.’
</p>

<p>
‘He ought,’ said Laura thoughtfully. ‘Are there
not sometimes amicable suits where both parties
are simply anxious to ascertain the truth ?’
</p>

<p>
‘ I suppose there must be,’ returned the Admiral.
</p>

<p>
‘ I will go away to my own room,’ said Laura.
‘ I feel as if I must be alone ; I am overpowered by
the sudden strangeness of my position !’
</p>

<p>
‘ God bless and guide you, my dear Laura,’ said
the Admiral, laying his hand on her head as she
passed him.
</p>

<p>
‘ Would you take a glass of wine, and then lie
down and try to sleep?’ asked Mrs. Crewe
anxiously, as if she had met with an accident.
</p>

<p>
‘ I want nothing but a little quiet thought,’ returned
Laura ; and then with a sudden impulse she
threw her arms round the kind woman’s neck and
kissed her affectionately as she left the room.
</p>

<hr> <!-- * * * * * -->

<p>
The rest of the day was curiously constrained
and oppressive. The Admiral having advised
avoidance of the subject uppermost in their
thoughts, conversation proceeded intermittently,
and the hours seemed to Laura preternaturally
long. She was in some ways relieved to think that
the first much-dreaded steps had been taken to-
wards righting the foul wrong to which she had
been subjected, yet she was terrified at being
launched upon the rapids of such a startling course.
Moreover, the sense of playing a part weakened her
courage. She was especially desirous that all things
should seem so clear and natural that Denzil’s
suspicions might not be roused.
</p>

<p>
‘ My dear,’ said Mrs. Crewe, as they went upstairs
at night, ‘ I feel as if I should burst. Do let me
come in and talk to you.’
</p>

<p>
‘ Yes, certainly, come in,’ returned Laura, opening
the door and lighting the candles on the dressing-table.
</p>

<p>
‘ To think of it all is too astonishing,’ continued
Mrs. Crewe, sitting down on a smart ottoman which
was really a bonnet-box.
</p>

<p>
Laura took a low cane chair and resigned herself
to listen, while Mrs. Crewe proceeded to remove
her lace cravatte and fold it up with mechanical,
unconscious care as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
‘ To think of you, who were in a manner of speak-
pooh-poohed and snubbed, and made little of,
being head over them all ! That poor conceited
set-up Mrs. Piers, the dowager as she liked to be
called, as if she were a duchess ! I really <em>am</em> sorry
for her ! Won’t she be ready to cut her tongue out
for having refused to receive <em>you</em> for a daughter-in-law.
She is incapable of seeing your worth as
<em>I</em> did, and was glad to welcome you without a
farthing ! Well ; it’s not every heiress that knows
she was chosen for herself alone, as you know my
dear blessed boy chose you ; and when I say, Laura
Piers, you deserve him,’ added the mother, with a
little sob, ‘ I give you the highest praise you will
ever get, be the other what it may.’
</p>

<p>
‘ I think you do, said Laura, drawing nearer
and taking Mrs. Crewe’s hand, which she stroked
gently.
</p>

<p>
‘ Never forget that he chose you out of pure disinterested
love,’ continued Mrs. Crewe emphatically,
‘ and he does love you, my dear, with all his
heart ! I saw that before you did. I wish he were
here to advise and support you in the present extraordinary crisis.
What do you think, my love ?
shall he have to take your name ?’
</p>

<p>
‘ I know as little as yourself, Mrs. Crewe. I
should much prefer to take his.”
</p>

<p>
‘ And you are right, Laura,’ she returned, with
grave emphasis, as she unpinned her cap and set it
on her knee, where it produced an uncanny effect,
as if she were holding a supplementary head.
‘ The Crewes are a good old family, though not in
the peerage, and a truer gentleman than my dear
boy never came of any stock, though adverse circumstances
compelled him to enter the mercantile
marine. Well, well, good luck comes to him at
last ! He gets a dear good wife and a fortune into
the bargain ; for I feel sure, my love, nothing will
make you break a promise once given !’
</p>

<p>
‘ I hope not,’ said Laura, with a faint smile, for
she saw the drift of her kind friend’s conversation.
‘ Nothing save Denzil’s own wish would induce me
to break with him.’
</p>

<p>
‘ And there is small danger of that !’ cried Mrs.
Crewe, kissing her with warmth. ‘ But, my dear,
what will Mrs. Reginald Piers say ? It will be an
awful trial to her. I hope and trust she will keep
friends with <em>you</em> and not run away with the idea
that you ought not to assert your rights, and all
that sort of thing.’
</p>

<p>
‘ I do not fear it,’ replied Laura thoughtfully.
‘ She has too much sense ;’ but even while she
spoke, a dim fear arose in her heart and chilled it.
</p>

<p>
‘ I am not so sure,’ said Mrs. Crewe. ‘ We are
seldom just or reasonable about those we love as
she loves her husband. Depend upon it, she will
be awfully cut up at the idea of his loss and mortification,
for though he carried it off with frank carelessness,
he was tremendously proud of Pierslynn
and his position. I changed <em>my</em> opinion of Reginald
Piers a good deal lately, and in spite of what
the Admiral says, I think the whole affair very
strange — very strange indeed.’
</p>

<p>
‘ It does not seem so to me,’ said Laura — ‘ at
least, in the sense you mean. But it is impossible
that Winifrid and I should fail to understand each
other ; and after all, our speculations may be quite
fruitless. Some fresh discovery, some new combination
of circumstances, may occur to sweep away
my pretensions ; let us not dwell upon them.’
</p>

<p>
‘ That is not at all likely. I consider your claim
indisputable. I wonder if Mr. Piers has got through
much of the savings ! I believe there was a considerable
sum in hand. Do you think, dear, you
will have a town as well as a country house ?’
</p>

<p>
‘ Oh, Mrs. Crewe !’ said Laura, laughing, in spite
of the anxiety and trepidation which oppressed
her. ‘ Such a question never occurred to me. Indeed,
I feel too much for Reginald and Winnie to
think how the change will affect myself.’
</p>

<p>
‘ Very pretty and praiseworthy indeed, my dear.
But — listen ; there’s Toppy crying to be let in. It
is a wet night. What an intelligent creature she is
to be sure! I’m coming, my precious puss, I’m
coming. Good-night, dearest Laura. I have kept
you too long out of your bed.’
</p>

<hr>


<p>
The interview with Messrs. Thurston and Trent
(for both partners shared the important consultation)
was a severe trial to Laura.
</p>

<p>
The surprise of both gentlemen was very great ;
indeed, it was several minutes before even Mr.
Trent’s keen faculties could assimilate the facts reported.
</p>

<p>
‘ These succession cases are often very extraordinary,
and few can surpass the present one <em>if</em> matters
turn out as you seem to think they will,’  he said.
</p>

<p>
‘ Very remarkable — very, indeed,’ observed Mr.
Thurston, playing with his eye-glass ; ‘ awkward
discovery for a man to make ; yet, after all, perhaps
less mortifying than to have it made by another.
At any rate, it puts Mr. Piers’s reputation beyond
a shadow of doubt.’
</p>

<p>
‘Yes,’ returned Mr. Trent, tapping the table
thoughtfully with a paper-knife ; ‘ he acted as any
honourable man would. Of course, I am glad
enough of your good fortune,’ to Laura. ‘ But, at
the same time, I feel sincerely for Reginald Piers ;
it is a tremendous blow.’
</p>

<p>
‘ You must direct me how best to soften it to
him,’ said Laura, in a low voice, feeling strangely
guilty, and perceiving clearly enough that with the
usual masculine <em>esprit de corps</em>, the partners thought
it a deplorable freak of fortune that a fine estate
should pass from the hands of a capable man to
those of a woman, and a plain, quiet, unremarkable
woman to boot.
</p>

<p>
‘ Of course we shall be happy to manage the
case for Miss Piers. Admiral, the sooner so important
a matter is settled the better. I will call on
Greenwood this afternoon, and ask to see the
papers. There is no use in making any plans or
suggestions till we ascertain how you really stand,
Miss Piers. It is really a curious affair, very
curious. I shall let you know the result of our
conference to-morrow morning.’
</p>

<p>
‘ This will be a startling piece of news for my
wife,’ said Mr. Trent, as he escorted the Admiral
and Laura downstairs. ‘She is in Dresden with our
youngest boy and girl, as you know, for the winter.
She was asking about you in her last letter. They
do not return till April.’
</p>

<p>
‘ My best regards to her,’ said Laura. ‘ I shall
be glad to see her again.’
</p>

<p>
After a few more words, Laura and her guardian
bade Mr. Trent good-morning and walked away
homewards.
</p>

<hr> <!-- * * * * * -->

<p>
‘ Well, I confess I am profoundly sorry at this
discovery,’ said Trent to Thurston. ‘ Just as Piers
was preparing to stand for ——  and settle down
into an active country gentleman.’
</p>

<p>
‘ He has not been very steady to the country as
yet,’ replied the- other drily. ‘He was always running
abroad and hither and thither.’
</p>

<p>
‘What an unlucky slip it was for him to have let
his engagement with this girl fall through ! Of
course, we thought him a fool then, and I must
say as far as beauty goes he has changed for the
better.’
</p>

<p>
‘Yes,’ said Mr. Thurston, ‘ perhaps ; but I find
Miss Piers a very interesting young woman.’
</p>

<p>
‘ She will be extremely interesting to many now,’
replied Mr. Trent. ‘ I doubt if this fortune will be
a real gain to her ; some sharper will marry her for
her money.’
</p>

<p>
‘ We must hope for better things,’ rejoined his
partner, as Mr. Trent closed his blotting-book and
prepared to go out.
</p>

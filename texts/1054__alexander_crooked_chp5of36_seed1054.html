<title>Chapter 5 of A Crooked Path by Mrs. Alexander</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">

<!-- CHAPTER V.<br>INTO THE SHADOWS -->
<p>To avoid Mrs. Frederic Liddell’s almost screaming
curiosity was not easy, and to appease it Kate assumed
an air of frankness, saying that she believed Mr. Liddell
merely wished to test her powers as secretary, and that
she hoped she had not succeeded too well.</p>

<p>“Oh, you lazy thing! You really ought to try to
get in with him. Oughtn’t she, Mrs. Liddell?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly, if she can; but I fancy it will not
be so easy. What are you going to do to-day, Ada?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing”—in a rather discontented tone. “Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because I am obliged to go into town on a matter
of business, and I want to take Katherine.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will look after the boys”—condescendingly,
as if it were not her legitimate business. “But I
really think you worry too much about those tiresome
publishers. They would think more of you if you
troubled them less. Your mother looks pale and fagged,
Katherine.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she does indeed,” looking anxiously at her.</p>

<p>“I am afraid the publishers would leave me too
utterly undisturbed if I left them alone,” returned Mrs.
Liddell, smiling and leaving the suggestion uncontradicted. This conversation took place at breakfast.</p>

<p>Mother and daughter made the journey cityward
very silently, both a good deal occupied conjecturing
what conditions John Liddell could possibly mean to
impose. Perhaps only a very high rate of interest,
which would cost no small effort to spare from their
narrow income.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton received his visitors directly their names
were sent up to him. His was an eminent firm ; their
offices, light, clean, well-furnished, an abode which impressed those who entered with the idea of fair dealing,
and forbade the notion of dark dusty corners, moral or
physical.</p>

<p>Katherine’s quick eyes took in the aspect of the place: the book-shelves, where stores of legal learning
in calf-bound volumes were ranged; the various brown
tin boxes with names in white paint, suggestive of the
title-deeds “of all the land;” the big knee-hole table
loaded with papers; the heavy chairs upholstered in the
best leather for the patients who came to be treated;
and Mr. Newton himself, more intensely cleaned up
and starched than ever, in an oaken seat of mediæval
form.</p>

<p>He rose and set chairs for Mrs. Liddell and her
daughter himself; then he rustled among his papers,
and spoke down a tube.</p>

<p>“Ahem!” he began. “Your brother-in-law, madam,
is a man of peculiar character, but by no means without discrimination. Thank you”—to a clerk who
brought in a long folded paper and laid it beside him,
disappearing quickly. “By no means without discrimination,” repeated Mr. Newton. “Unfortunately, the love
of money grows on a childless man, and his terms for
the loan you require may not meet your approbation.”</p>

<p>“Pray what are they?” asked Mrs. Liddell.</p>

<p>“My client will accept a bill of sale on your furniture as security, but he will give you a period of
eighteen months to repay him, and he will charge ten
per cent. ; but if you agree to another condition, which
I will explain, he will be content with five per cent.”</p>

<p>“This must be a severe condition,” said Mrs. Liddell,
with a slight smile.</p>

<p>“No: it may prove a fortunate condition,” said the
lawyer, with some hesitation. “In short, I have persuaded Mr. Liddell to allow me to choose him a respectable servant at fair wages. The state into which he has fallen is deplorable. I felt it my duty to remonstrate with him, and he is not averse to my influence. I therefore pressed upon him the necessity of
having a better class of housekeeper, a person who
could read to him and write for him, and would be
above drink and pilfering.”</p>

<p>“What did he say to that?” asked Katherine, with
a bright, amused look.</p>

<p>“He said, very decidedly: ‘I will have that girl you
say is my niece to be my housekeeper and reader.
She gave me the best and cheapest dinner I ever ate;
her letter to my stock-broker brought me luck; and I
will pay ready-money for everything, so she shall not
be able to leave books unpaid. If she comes I will be
content with five per cent. on the loan, which must do
instead of salary; and if she refuses, why, so do I.’
An ungracious speech, Mrs. Liddell, but there is the
condition.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean my brother-in-law will refuse to help
me if my daughter does not go to manage his house?”</p>

<p>“So he says.”</p>

<p>“But did he not say at first that he would take ten
per cent. without this sacrifice?”</p>

<p> <i>“He</i> said so at first; then this plan seemed to
strike him, and he was very firm about it.”</p>

<p>“It is an awful place to go to.”</p>

<p>The words burst from Katherine’s lips before she
could stop herself.</p>

<p>“I can hardly agree to such a condition as this,”
cried Mrs. Liddell.</p>

<p>“And I must urge you not to reject it,” said Mr.
Newton, impressively, “for the sake of your daughter and grandsons. I must point out that by refusing you
not only deprive yourself of the temporary aid you
require, but you cut off your daughter from all chance
of winning over her uncle by the influence of her presence. Propinquity, my dear madam—propinquity sometimes works wonders; and Mr. Liddell has a great deal
in his power. I would not encourage false hopes, but
this is a chance you may never have again—a chance
of sharing her uncle’s fortune. If she refuses, he will
never see her again.”</p>

<p>Silence ensued. The choice was a grave difficulty.
Mrs. Liddell looked at Katherine, and Katherine looked
at the carpet.</p>

<p>Suddenly Katherine looked up quickly, and said, in
a clear, decided voice:</p>

<p>“I will go. I will undertake the office of secretary
and housekeeper—at least until my mother pays off
this loan.”</p>

<p>“Katie, my child, how shall you be able to bear it?”</p>

<p>“Miss Liddell has decided wisely and well,” said
the lawyer. “I earnestly hope—nay, I believe—she
will reap a rich reward for her self-sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Newton, I cannot consent without some
reflection. I too have some conditions to impose.”</p>

<p>“And they are?” put in Newton, uneasily.</p>

<p>“I cannot define them all clearly on the spur of
the moment; but I must have leave to go and see my
daughter whenever I choose, and she must have the
right to spend one day in the week at home.”</p>

<p>“This might be arranged,” said the lawyer, thoughtfully. “Be brave, my dear madam. Sacrifice something of the present to secure future good.”</p>

<p>“Provided we do not pay too high a price for a
doubtful benefit. It will be terrible for a young girl to
be the bond-slave of such a man as John Liddell.”</p>

<p>“Well, mother, I am quite willing to undertake
the task. Not that I am going to be a bond-slave, for,
as soon as you have paid your debt, I shall consider
myself free.”</p>

<p>“By that time, my dear young lady, I hope you
will have made yourself of so much importance to your
uncle that he will make it worth your while to stay,”
exclaimed Newton, who was evidently actuated by a
friendly feeling toward both mother and daughter.</p>

<p>“He must bribe high, then,” returned Kate, laughing.</p>

<p>“Then may I inform Mr. Liddell that you accept
his proposition? and are you prepared to begin your
duties at once? Remember, he considers his acceptance of five instead of ten per cent. frees him from
the necessity of paying you any salary.”</p>

<p>“Surely the labourer is worthy of his hire?” said
Mrs. Liddell.</p>

<p>“No doubt of it, madam; but the case is a peculiar
one.”</p>

<p>Some more particulars were discussed and arranged; Mr. Newton begged Mrs. Liddell to look out for and select a
servant, that Katherine might begin with some prospect of comfort. It was settled that an interview should be arranged between Mrs. Liddell and her brother-in-law on the day but one following, at which Mr. Newton was to assist. Finally she signed a paper, and received six lovely new crisp bank-notes, the magic touch of which has so marvellously reviving an effect.</p>

<p>Katherine slipped her arm through her mother’s
and pressed it lovingly as they walked to the Metropolitan station for their return journey.</p>

<p>“Now, dear, you will have a little peace,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Dear-bought peace, my darling. I cannot reconcile
myself to such a fate for you.”</p>

<p>“Still, the money is a comfort.”</p>

<p>“It is indeed. I will pay the rent to-day, and to-morrow I will give Ada her money. That will be an
infinite relief. And still I shall have a few pounds left.
Katie dear, is it not too dreadful, the prospect of eating, drinking, sleeping, and beginning <i>di nuovo</i> each
morning in that gloomy house? How shall you bear
it?”</p>

<p>“You shall see. If I can have a little chat with
you every week I shall be able for a good deal. Then,
remember, the book still remains. When that succeeds
we may snap our fingers at rich uncles.”</p>

<p>“When that time comes,” interrupted her mother,
“you will be tied to the poor old miser by habit and
the subtle claims which pity and comprehension weave
round the sympathetic.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if I ever grow to like him it will simplify
matters very much. I almost hope I may, but it is not
likely. How strange it will be to live in a different
house from you! How dreadfully the boys will tease
you when I am away! Come; suppose we go and see
the <i>Cheerful Visitor</i>—the editor, I mean—before we
return, and then we can say we <i>have</i> been to a publisher. I really do not think Ada knows the difference between an editor and a publisher.”</p>

<p>“Very likely; nor would you, probably, if you had
not a mother who scribbles weak fiction.”</p>

<p>“It is a great deal better than much that is published and paid for,” said Katherine, emphatically.</p>

<p>“Ah! Kate, when money has long been scarce you
get into a bad habit of estimating things merely at
their market value. However, let us visit the <i>Cheerful
Visitor</i> on our homeward way. Of course we must tell
Ada of the impending change, but we need not explain
too much.”</p>

<p>The journey back was less silent. Both mother and
daughter were oppressed by the task undertaken by
the latter, but Katherine was successful in concealing
the dismay with which she contemplated a residence
with John Liddell.</p>

<p>“Whatever happens, I must not seem afraid of him
or <i>be</i> afraid of him,” she thought, with instinctive perception. “I will try to do what is just and right, and
leave the rest to Providence. It must be a great comfort to have faith—to believe that if you do the right
thing you will be directed and assisted by God. What
strength it would give! But I haven’t faith. I cannot
believe that natural laws will ever be changed for me,
and I <i>know</i> that good, honest, industrious creatures die of hunger every day. No matter. ‘Do rightly, come
what may,’ is the motto of every true soul. I don’t
suppose I shall melt this old man’s stony heart, but I
will do my best for him. His has been a miserable
life in spite of his money. There is so much money
cannot buy!”</p>

<p>“How dreadfully late you are!” said Mrs. Frederic,
querulously, when they reached home. “I really could not keep the children waiting for you, so we have
finished dinner; but Maria is keeping the mutton as hot
as she can for you. Dear me! how sick I am of roast
mutton! but I suppose it is cheap”—contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Poor dear! it shall have something nice to-morrow,”
returned Mrs. Liddell, with her usual strong good
temper.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are too tired, Katherine, to come
with me. The band plays in Kensington Gardens to-day, and I wanted so much to go and hear it.”</p>

<p>“I am indeed! Besides, mother has a great deal
to tell you when we have had some dinner.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed! Has your book been accepted, Mrs.
Liddell? or has that terrible uncle of ours declared
Katherine to be his heiress?”</p>

<p>“Have a little patience, and you shall hear every
thing.”</p>

<p>“I am dying of curiosity and impatience. Here,
Sarah, <i>do</i> bring up dinner—Mrs. Liddell is <i>so</i> hungry!”</p>

<p>The announcement that Katherine was invited to
live with John Liddell created a tornado of amazement,
envy, anticipation—with an under-current of exultant
pride that they were at last recognized by the only rich
man in the family—in the mind of the pretty, impressionable little widow.</p>

<p>“Gracious! What a grand thing for Kate! But
she will be moped to death, and he will starve her.
Why, Katherine, when it is known that a millionaire
has adopted you, his den will be besieged by your admirers. I should not be surprised if Colonel Ormonde
declared himself. You will never be able to stand
such a life for long at a time. Suppose I relieve guard every fortnight? You must let me have my innings,
too. Old gentlemen always like me, I am so cheerful.
Then I might have the boys to see him; you know he
ought to divide the property between us.”</p>

<p>“Of course he ought. I wish he would have us
alternately; it would be a great relief,” said Katherine,
laughing.</p>

<p>“I fancy he is <i>Im</i>-mensely rich,” continued Ada.
“Why, Mr. Errington evidently knew his name.”</p>

<p>“Who is Mr. Errington?” asked Mrs. Liddell, with
languid curiosity.</p>

<p>“Did you never hear of the Calcutta Erringtons?”
cried Ada, with infinite superiority. “They are as rich
as Jews, their house is one of the greatest in India.
Old Mr. Errington bought a fine place in the country
lately, and this young man—I’m sure I don’t know if
he <i>is</i> young! he is as grave as a judge and as stiff as
a poker—at all events, he is an only son. I met him
at the Barnetts’ yesterday. Well, <i>he</i> seemed to know
Mr. Liddell’s name quite well. Colonel Ormonde
pricked up his ears too when I said you had gone to
see him. It is a great advantage to have a rich old
bachelor uncle, Katherine, but you must not keep him
all to yourself.”</p>

<hr><!-- extra space between paragraphs in the original text. -->

<p>The next few days were agitated and much occupied. Katherine went for part of each to read and
write and market for the old recluse, and he grew less
formidable, but not more likable, as he became more
familiar. He was an extraordinary example of a human
being converted into a money-making and accumulating
machine. He was not especially irritable; indeed, his physical powers were weak and dying of every species
of starvation; but his coldness was supernatural. Fortunately for Katherine, his former housekeeper was greedy
and extravagant, so that his niece’s management seemed
wise and economical, and she had an excellent backer-up in Mr. Newton.</p>

<p>The old miser was with difficulty persuaded to see
his sister-in-law; but Mrs. Liddell insisted on an interview, and Mr. Newton himself supported her through
the trying ordeal.</p>

<p>The mother’s heart sank within her at the sight of
the gloomy, desolate abode in which her bright daughter
was to be immured; but she comforted herself by reflecting that it need not be for long.</p>

<p>Mr. Liddell did not rise from the easy-chair in
which he sat crouched together, his thin grey locks
escaping as usual from under the skull-cap, his long
lean brown hands grasping the arms of his chair, when
Mrs. Liddell came in; neither did he hold out his hand.
He looked at her fixedly with his glittering dark eyes.</p>

<p>“You wanted to see me?” he said. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I thought it right to see and speak with
you before committing my only child to your keeping.”</p>

<p>“But you have done it!—She has agreed to the conditions, hasn’t she?” turning to Newton. “If you go back, I must have my money back.”</p>

<p>“Of course, my dear sir—of course,” soothingly.</p>

<p>“I am glad that Katherine can be of use to you.
I do not wish to retract anything I have agreed to, but
I wish to remind you that my child is young; that you
must let her go in and out, and have opportunities for air and exercise.”</p>

<p>“She may do as she likes; she can do anything.
So long as she reads to me, and buys my food without
wasting my money, <i>I</i> don’t want her company. She
seems to know something of the value of money, and
I’ll keep her in pledge till you have paid me. I’ll
never let myself be cheated again, as I was by your
worthless husband.”</p>

<p>“Let the dead rest,” said Mrs. Liddell, sadly. “I
have paid you what I could.”</p>

<p>“Ay, the principal—the bare principal. What is
that? Do men lend for the love of lending?” he returned, viciously.</p>

<p>“Pray do not vex yourself. It is useless to look
back—annoying and useless,” said the lawyer, with decision.</p>

<p>“Useless, indeed! What more have you to say?”</p>

<p>“I should like to see the room my daughter is to
occupy. It is as well she should have the comforts
necessary to health, for all our sakes. <i>You</i> will not
find one who will serve you as Katherine can, even for
a high price. I think you feel this yourself,” said Mrs.
Liddell, steadily.</p>

<p>“You may go where you like, but do not trouble
me. You can come and see your daughter, but <i>I</i> shall
not want to see you; and she may go and see you of
a Sunday, when there are no newspapers to be read;
but, mark you, I will not pay for carriages or horses or
omnibuses; and mark also that I have made my will,
and I’ll not alter it in anyone’s favour. Your daughter
will have her food and lodging and my countenance
and protection.”</p>

<p>“She has done without these for nineteen years,” said Mrs. Liddell, with a slight smile. “But you have
given me very opportune help, for which I am grateful;
so I have accepted your terms. Kate shall stay with
you till I have paid your principal and interest, and
then <i>I</i> warn you I shall reclaim my hostage.”</p>

<p>“She’ll be a good while with me,” he said with a
sneer. “None of you—you, your husband, or your
son—ever had thirty pounds to spare in your lives.”</p>

<p>“Time will show,” returned Mrs. Liddell, with admirable steadiness and temper. “Now I will bid you good-day, and take advantage of your permission to look over your house.”</p>

<p>“Let me show you the way,” said Newton. “I shall
return to you presently, Mr. Liddell.”</p>

<p>The old man bent his head. “See that the girl
comes to-morrow,” he said, and leaned back wearily in
his chair.</p>

<p>The friendly lawyer led the way upstairs, and
showed Mrs. Liddell a large room, half bed half sitting-room, with plenty of old-fashioned furniture. This was, I think, the drawing-room,” said Mr. Newton; “and
having extracted permission from my very peculiar
client to have the house cleaned, so far as it could be
done, which it sorely needed, the person I employed
selected the best of the furniture for this room. We
propose to give the next room at the back to the
servant. You have, I believe, found one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a respectable elderly woman, of whom I have
an excellent character.”</p>

<p>After Mrs. Liddell had visited the rooms upstairs—
mere dismantled receptacles of rubbish—and they returned to what was to be Katherine’s abode, she sat down on the ponderous sofa, and in spite of her efforts
to control herself the tears would well up and roll over.</p>

<p>“I feel quite ashamed of myself,” she said, in a
broken voice; “but when I think of my Katie here
alone, with that cruel old man, it is too much for her
strength. She has been so tenderly reared, her life,
though quiet and humble, has been so cared for, so
tranquil, that I shrink from the idea of her banishment
here.”</p>

<p>“It is not unnatural, my dear madam, but indeed
the trial is worth enduring. Do not believe that the
will of which Mr. Liddell speaks is irrevocable. He
has made two or three to my certain knowledge, and
it would be foolish to cut your daughter off from
any chance of sharing his fortune, which is considerable, I assure you, merely to avoid a little present annoyance.”</p>

<p>“It would indeed. Do not think me very weak.
It is a passing fit of the dolefuls. I have had much
anxiety of late, and for the moment I have a painful
feeling that I have sold myself and my dear daughter
into the hands of a relentless creditor; that I shall
never free my neck from his yoke. I shall probably
feel differently to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I daresay you will. You are a lady of much
imagination; a writer, your daughter tells me. Such
an occupation should be an outlet for all imaginative
terrors or anticipations, and leave your mind, your
judgment, clear and free. I am sure Miss Liddell will
do her uncle and herself good by her residence here.
Mr. Liddell has been a source of anxiety to me and to
my partners. We have, you know, been his legal advisers for years, and to know that he is in good hands
will be a great relief. Rely on my—on our doing our
best to assist your daughter in every way.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Liddell, perceiving the friendly spirit which
actuated the precise lawyer, thanked him warmly, and,
after a little further discussion of details, took her way
home.</p>

<p>From the step she had voluntarily taken there was
no retreat, nor, to do her justice, was Katherine Liddell
in the least disposed to turn back, having once put her
hand to the plough. Indeed, the blessed castle-building powers of youth disposed her to rear airy edifices
as regarded the future, which lightened the present
gloom. Suppose John Liddell were to soften towards
her, and make her a handsome present occasionally, or
forgive this debt to her mother? What a delightful reward this would be for her temporary servitude! But,
though Katie readily amused herself with such fancies,
they never crystallized into hope. Hope still played round
her mother’s chance of success with the publishers. Not
that she fancied her dear mother a genius; on the contrary, because she <i>was</i> her mother, she probably undervalued her work; but she knew that hundreds of stories
printed and paid for, lacked the common-sense and
humour of Mrs. Liddell’s.</p>

<p>How ardently she longed to give her mother something of a rest after the burden and heat of the day
which she had borne so well and so long—a spell of
peaceful twilight, before the grey shadows of everlasting
darkness closed, or the brightness of eternal light broke
upon her. Yes, she would stand four-square against
the steely terrors of John Liddell’s cold egotism and penuriousness, against the desolation and gloom of his
forbidding abode, the crushing sordidness of an existence reduced to the merest straws of sustenance—provided she could lighten her mother’s load, perhaps
secure her future ease; and she would do her task well
thoroughly, keeping a steady heart and a bright face.
Then should the tide ever turn, what deep draughts of
pleasure she would drink!</p>

<p>Katherine was not socially ambitious, finery and
grandeur as such did not attract her, but real joys,
beauty and gaiety, the company of pleasant people, <i>i.e.,</i>
people who suited <i>her</i>,—graceful surroundings,—becoming clothes, and plenty of them, all were dear and
delightful to her.</p>

<p>Some of these things she had tasted when she lived
with her mother in the German and Italian towns where
she had been chiefly educated, the rest she was satisfied
to imagine; above all, she loved to charm those with
whom she associated, loved it in a half-unconscious way.
Were it to a poor blind beggar woman or a little crossing-sweeper, she would speak as gently and modulate
her voice as carefully as to the most brilliant partner
or the greatest lady.</p>

<p>This might be tenderness of nature, or the profound
instinct to win liking and admiration, as yet it was quite
instinctive; but, if hurt or offended, she could feel resentment very vividly, and was by no means too ready
to forgive.</p>

<p>Unfortunately she started with a strong prejudice
against her uncle, and sometimes rehearsed in her own
mind exceedingly fine speeches, which she would have liked to address to her miserly relative, on the subject
of his cruelty to his son, his avarice, his egotism.</p>

<p>Still, a strain of pity ran through her meditations,
—was life worth living spent as his was? How far had
his nature been warped by his wife’s desertion?</p>

<p>It was an extraordinary experience to Katherine,
this packing up of her belongings to quit her home.
She took as little as she could help, to keep up the
idea that she was entering on a very temporary engagement; besides, as she meant to adhere rigidly to her
right of a weekly visit to her mother, she could always
get what she wanted.</p>

<p>After Mrs. Liddell, Katherine found it hardest to
part with the boys, specially little Charlie, whose
guardian and champion she had constituted herself.
Her sister-in-law had rather an irritating effect upon
her, of which she was a little ashamed, and whenever
she had spoken sharply (which she did occasionally),
she was ready to atone for it by doing some extra
service, so that, on the whole, the pretty little widow
got a good deal more out of her sister than out of her
mother-in-law.</p>

<p>But meditations, resolutions, regrets, and preparations notwithstanding, the day of Katherine’s departure
arrived.</p>

<p>It was a bright glowing afternoon and the Thursday
fixed for the boating-party. Mrs. Liddell junior had
expended much eloquence to no purpose, as she well
knew it would be, in trying to persuade her sister-in-law to postpone the commencement of what the little
widow was pleased to call her “penal servitude,” and
accompany her to Twickenham.</p>

<p>She departed, however, without her, looking her
very best and uttering many promises to come and see
Katie soon, to try her powers of pleasing on that dreadful old uncle of ours, to bring the dear boys and see
if they would not cut out their auntie, &c.</p>

<p>Mrs. Liddell and her daughter were most thankful
to have the last few hours together, and yet they said
little, and that chiefly respecting past days which they
had enjoyed together—little excursions on the Elbe or
in the neighbourhood of Florence, and a couple of
months once passed at Sienna, which was a mental
epoch to Katherine who was then about fifteen. Promises to write, and tender queries on the mother’s side
if she had remembered this or that.</p>

<p>The little boys clung to her, Charlie in tears, Cecil
very solemn. Both had taken up the sort of “camera
obscura” image of their elder’s views which children
contrive to obtain so mysteriously, without hearing anything distinct concerning them, and both considered
“Uncle John” a sort of modern ogre, only restrained
by the policeman outside from making a daily meal of
the nearest infant school, and sure to gobble up auntie
some day. Charlie trembled at the thought, Cecil
pondered profoundly how, by the judicious arrangement
of a trap-door in the middle of his room, he might
carry out the original idea of Jack the Giant Killer.</p>

<p>“Pray do not think of coming with me, mother!”
said Katherine, seeing Mrs. Liddell take out her bonnet.
“I could not bear to think of your lonely drive back!
Trust me to myself; I am not going to be either frightened or cast down, and I will write to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Then I must let you go, darling! On Sunday
next, Katie, we shall see you.”</p>

<p>A long fond embrace, and Mrs. Liddell was indeed
alone.</p>

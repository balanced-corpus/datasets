“The million flit as gay<br>
As if created only like the fly,<br>
That spreads his motley wings in the eye of noon,<br>
To sport his season and be seen no more.”<br>
Cowper<br>

<p>“This is really kind of you, dear Mrs. Greville,” said Lady Okehampton, cordially, as Eveline was announced, next day. “I am so lost without my girls. I heard from Pamela this morning; they seem to be enjoying themselves very much in Paris, and they talk of meeting Gwen and Humphrey at Baden, soon. She desires me to give her love to you, and to say she is going to write.”</p>
<p>“Ah! delighted to see you,” said Lord Okehampton, coming in and shaking hands with his pretty guest. “My dear” — this to his wife — “I have asked one or two men I saw at the Club to dine here to-night. You must send out cards for some dinner-parties while Mrs. Greville is with us. Here’s a letter from Lorton” (he was the eldest son, then travelling in America), “we shall have him home in three weeks, you see — not transformed into a Yankee, I hope. I hear Montserrat has returned, I am going to call there; can I do any thing for you?”</p>
<p>“Is the duchess in town?”</p>
<p>“No, I fancy not.”</p>
<p>“Dear Mrs. Greville,” said Lady Okehampton, in a piteous voice, when Eveline, having divested herself of her bonnet and cloak, returned to the drawing-room, “will you make out some cards for me? I suppose mothers ought to rejoice when their daughters marry, but it is a terrible loss; my girls always made out the cards, and arranged everything.”</p>
<p>“Well,” replied Eveline, cheerfully, “with your visiting list, and a little help from you, I shall perhaps be able to manage it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much; that is so kind, we can do it after dinner, and if I do go to sleep yeu will not mind, will you? A railway is so tiring.”</p>
<p>The “one or two” men whom Lord Okehampton had asked, turned out to be some half-dozen, as Eveline discovered when she entered the drawing-room. Her host named one or two to her, and dinner being announced took her downstairs.</p>
<p>The dinner was very pleasant, and Lady Okehampton, generally too indolent to talk, was quite lively and agreeable, and keen about the gossip of the day; but the effort had its reaction. After dinner, comfortably ensconced in an arm-chair, her feet on the fender stool, a screen in her hand, she began going over her visiting list with Eveline; here and there giving an amusing anecdote as a name struck her.</p>
<p>All went smoothly at first, but presently the combined effects of fire and railway proved too much for her, and after giving a few of the wildest answers, her ladyship’s head sank back on the well-cushioned chair, and a gentle—</p>
<div>
<p>“Oh, call it by some other name”</p>
</div>
<p>than snore, denoted that she slumbered.</p>
<p>Eveline took up a book, but her thoughts wandered far away, chiefly to her future life in London, and she asked herself if she had been wise in giving up her quiet life in Wales, to encounter the bustle and turmoil of society; and the dread growing with the thought, she decided that she had been very impulsive.</p>
<p>Reverie and slumber were alike broken, by the gentlemen coming into the drawing-room.</p>
<p>Lady Okehampton opened her eyes, and tried to look wide awake, and, to prove that she had never been to sleep, smiled on all around with the complacent, inane smile peculiar to people under such circumstances.</p>
<p>“Lord Okehampton, I bought a house this morning,” said Eveline.</p>
<p>“You came up yesterday, and bought a house to-day? What an impulsive being you are! And where is it?”</p>
<p>“That is exactly what I have been saying to myself,” said Eveline, answering his second exclamation, which tallied so completely with her own feelings.</p>
<p>“Oh! a castle in the air?” rejoined the other, laughing, “nothing very serious after all.”</p>
<p>“Not at all in the air; but very much in Lowndes Square; but like the man who got in the balloon, I am rather afraid of what I have done.”</p>
<p>“What number is it?” asked one of the guests. “I know Ashton has a house there he wants to sell.”</p>
<p>“No. 0, is that his?”</p>
<p>“Precisely. He was going to be married, in fact had been engaged a long time,” continued the speaker, carefully sugaring his coffee, “but the girl died of consumption a few days before the marriage. A little more sugar, if you please,” — this to the footman.</p>
<p>“Oh! I am so sorry you told me,” exclaimed Eveline. “I wondered why it was so beautifully furnished, and this accounts for it. I shall have no pleasure in it now.”</p>
<p>“Why should you not benefit by it, as well as any one else?” asked Mr. Temple, sipping his coffee.</p>
<p>“Because it is very painful to know we are owing our pleasures to the misery of others,” said Eveline, a little disgusted.</p>
<p>“It is the kindest thing for Ashton, anyway, and somebody must have it, for he will never live there.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe it ever answers to speculate or moralize on these matters,” said another; “where one man wins, another loses; but I don’t fancy it troubles him much. By the way, Okehampton, did you hear that last night there was very high play at —, and Archer lost a hatful of money; he can ill afford it, I fancy.”</p>
<p>“Very ill, indeed,” said Lord Okehampton. “Vandeleur behaved in the most generous way to him last year — he is a relation of his wife’s, you know; he lost a very heavy sum and Vandeleur payed it, on his promising never to touch cards or dice again. He will be very much annoyed at this.”</p>
<p>Delighted to hear this kindly trait in her friend, a trait which confirmed all the good she believed of him, Eveline listened, in the hope that more would be said; but as every one did not look on Vandeleur as a little god, the subject dropped, and turned to the more interesting one of the coming Derby.</p>
<p>The next evening they went to the Opera, to hear the divine Grisi, silent — alas! that it should be so — for ever now.</p>
<p>The appearance of the beautiful stranger, with the splendid diamonds, in Lady Okehampton’s box excited a good deal of speculation. Many a lorgnon was fixed on her, and the verdict was highly favourable. She was “somebody” evidently, and as soon as the first act was over, the box was besieged by men anxious to have a nearer look at the new beauty.</p>
<p>“Who the deuce is she?” asked one of the men in the Guards’ box.</p>
<p>“I can tell you,” said Devereux, with his languid drawl. “I met her down in the country, she’s a little widow with lots of tin.”</p>
<p>“Any drawbacks? one might go in for her, you know — sweet cherubs? jointure? that sort of thing?”</p>
<p>“Not a bit of it. All her own. Bred as Eclipse. Proud as Lucifer. Here’s Markham” — as the door opened — “ask him. He has made his reputation as a poet, writing sonnets to her eyebrow.”</p>
<p>“Hullo, Markham, in for widows again?” chaffed a friend, as he came in.</p>
<p>“Hang widows! Don’t speak of them,” said he, testily.</p>
<p>“Poor fellow! it must be a sore subject,” said the other, laughing; “but you wouldn’t hang anything as pretty as that, would you?”</p>
<p>No sooner did our old acquaintance Bob see Mrs. Greville, than uttering “By George!” he darted out of the box, and in a few minutes was shaking hands with her. His friends laughed.</p>
<p>“Hit in that quarter. Any chance?”</p>
<p>“None,” said Devereux, who, by virtue of his few days’ acquaintance, imagined that he knew all about her — “none; women <i>do</i> take queer fancies sometimes, but I don’t think she’ll take to Markham.”</p>
<p>“How is it she never showed before?” “Where has she sprung from?” “She knows people, too; she and Van seem old friends.” “There’s the Plantagenet shaking hands with her.” “Where does she hail from?” were the questions which assailed Devereux, when it was seen that he was personally acquainted with the charming widow in question.</p>
<p>“From Wales,” responded he, “where she has been doing a little private suttee without the fire. Husband — weeds — weeping — that kind of thing. How splendidly she is singing to-night.” This last referred to Grisi.</p>
<p>Utterly unconscious of the interest that she was creating, Eveline gave herself up to the enjoyment of the music. Every sense merged in that of hearing, she sat entranced, while the tears stole down her cheeks.</p>
<p>“How you love music,” said Vandeleur, when he was taking her downstairs.</p>
<p>“I do, indeed; and yet the pleasure it produces amounts to pain sometimes. You must have thought me very childish, but all my sympathy was aroused for poor Norma.”</p>
<p>“In spite of her fault?” asked Vandeleur, in a voice only meant to reach her ear.</p>
<p>“Alas! poor Norma!” replied the other, with the pity a truly pure woman never fears to evince for a suffering sinner.</p>
<p>“Lady Okehampton’s carriage!” was here shouted; and as they hurriedly struggled through the crush, Vandeleur asked if she should be at home after church to-morrow.</p>
<p>The carriage was up — impatient policemen waiting to send it on — Lady Okehampton and Eveline were hurried in — the door banged to — and Vandeleur only read his answer in her face.</p>
<p>“Going to the Opera is the easiest way of telling people one is in town,” said Lady Oke hampton, settling herself in a corner of the carriage. It was too dark for her to see the amused look on her companion’s face at this, to her, novel way of regarding such music as they had just heard.</p>
<p>“You looked very pretty, my dear. I foresee a great many visitors to-morrow, to <i>call</i> on me, but to see you.”</p>
<p>As Lady Okehampton prophesied, her drawing-room was crowded the next day. The fame of her beautiful and wealthy Italian cousin had already gone abroad, and many were the visitors who sought an introduction.</p>
<p>Anxious that she should be well launched on the waves of London society, Lady Okehampton organised a set of charming little dinners, where the guests — few and choice — made society a real pleasure, and not a penalty as it often is.</p>
<p>Young, beautiful, and rich, the world was at Eveline’s feet, and life was very pleasant to her; but she never thought of asking her self how much of her happiness was due to Vandeleur, whom, either at home or abroad, she rarely failed of meeting, at all events, once in the day. He surrounded her with a thousand little cares — those nameless nothings which individually seem scarce worth mentioning, but which so plainly show that the one woman’s pleasure is tenderly cared for, and that the thought of her is seldom out of the man’s mind.</p>
<p>And how about Mrs. Vandeleur all this time?</p>
<p>Mrs. Vandeleur was still in the country, happily ignorant of her lord’s amusements; but the day came for her arrival, and on the following one she dined at the Okehamptons.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, for a woman, Eveline had asked no questions about Mrs. Vandeleur’s personal appearance, and she was consider ably taken aback when she saw that lady enter the drawing-room on her husband’s arm.</p>
<p>A tall, gaunt woman, looking years older than her fair-haired <i>débonnair</i> spouse — one of those women who never look young — who seem to have been born old — with black hair, black eyes, black dress, a black mass which somewhat cruelly contrasted her sallow complexion and thin, bloodless lips. Her unbending, hard nature could be read at a glance — nothing soft or feminine there.</p>
<p>“<i>That</i> his wife?” was Eveline’s mental ejaculation. “Impossible!”</p>
<p>But it was very possible: she was the veritable wife <i>in propriâ personâ</i>, and before Mrs. Greville had rallied from her surprise, she found herself being introduced and making civil speeches about the pleasure, &c, &c.</p>
<p>A stiff curtsey — Mrs. Vandeleur always curtseyed — and Mrs. Greville’s outstretched but unheeded hand fell by her side. Half ready to cry, but very indignant, she haughtily said, “That having heard so much of her, she had forgotten they were strangers.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Vandeleur gazed coldly at her while she was speaking, and without further notice turned to speak to some men near her.</p>
<p>The colour mantled in Mrs. Greville’s cheek, and every whit as cold and proud, but far more civil — it was not in her nature to be discourteous — she looked at her in amazement, and very haughtily turned away.</p>
<p>All, save the husband, were too much engrossed to notice this little scene, but he jealously watched the result of this first meeting. He gnawed his moustache with vexation: what else could he do? He saw that they were enemies at first sight, and too late recognised his mistake in having so warmly praised to his wife a woman with whom he wished to see her friends.</p>
<p>“What are you looking so intent about?” asked Lord Okehampton. “You look as if you had lost something.”</p>
<p>“I have both lost and found,” replied Eveline, quickly recovering herself. “I have lost an illusion and found a puzzle.”</p>
<p>“You are disappointed in our friend’s wife,” said her host, with a quaint look at her.</p>
<p>“A strangely incongruous couple, apparently. Is she agreeable?”</p>
<p>“She is clever,” he replied, shortly.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Montserrat here approached with her husband, whom she wished to introduce to Eveline. A tall, fine-looking man, with keen eyes, not unlike a Scotch terrier’s, which looked her over in a moment — as she felt. The look satisfied him that his wife’s taste was, as usual, unerring.</p>
<p>He spoke to her very civilly about what he called her kindness to the duchess in his absence.</p>
<p>Eveline looked up, and fairly laughed — a frank laugh which made them friends at once.</p>
<p>“Your grace is pleased to be merry,” said she; “the duchess was very kind to <i>me</i>, and I spent a very pleasant time at Rossmoor.”</p>
<p>Vandeleur came up to shake hands with the duke, while Eveline went over to the sofa whence the duchess was signing to her.</p>
<p>“We have a few people to-morrow night; are you disengaged?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and delighted; for the Okehamptons dine out to-morrow.”</p>
<p>“And not you? No? Then I shall expect you to dinner.”</p>
<p>“Duchess, do you know Mrs. Vandeleur?”</p>
<p>“Certainly, I know her.”</p>
<p>“Is she shy, or bad-mannered, or what?”</p>
<p>“Neither one nor the other, that I know of; but very wooden. <i>I</i> do not care for her, but she is an excellent woman.”</p>
<p>Vandeleur never once approached Eveline, who, thinking that he was vexed with her for her cold reception of his wife, after all her professions of wishing to know her, determined to make one more effort to thaw that block of ice; so, stopping by her side, on her way to the piano, Eveline asked her if she were fond of music, and if there were anything she would like her to sing.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vandeleur waited with an icy demeanour, impossible to mistake, till the other had finished, and then,</p>
<p>“Thank you. I do not care for music,” was the frigid answer.</p>
<p>“Don’t waste your smiles on that odious woman,” said Mr. Lovell, a good-looking Guardsman who, a few days before, had fallen desperately in love with Mrs. Greville at first sight; “bestow them where they will be appreciated.”</p>
<p>“Why do you call her odious?” retorted Mrs. Greville. “I am told she is excellent.”</p>
<p>“Heaven preserve me from such excellence!” exclaimed Frank Lovell. “Conceive having such a finger-post always before one, pointing the way to go! Poor Van, he’s awfully depressed when his wife’s with him, and no wonder.”</p>
<p>He was standing near his wife, and talking to a lady next her; but there was nothing to denote any particular depression about him; and so Mrs. Greville remarked to Mr. Lovell.</p>
<p>“Yes, but look at the lady he is talking to!” said he, lightly, “even Mrs. Vandeleur could not be jealous of anything so old; besides, she is Mrs. Vandeleur’s own mother. Will you sing once more?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Greville went to the piano, and when next she looked round, the Vandeleurs had gone.</p>
<p>“Have you known Mrs. Vandeleur long?” asked she of Lady Okehampton, when she was alone with her host and hostess, after the departure of the last guest, “and do you like her?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have known her a long time, and I suppose I like her. She is an excellent woman.”</p>
<p>“Well, she <i>need</i> be; for she is the most odious, ill-bred woman I ever had the ill-luck to meet,” said Mrs. Greville, emphatically.</p>
<p>“Well done!” laughed Lord Okehampton, “I did not think that those little lips could be so vehement. She has not a good manner; but there are two sides to every question.”</p>
<p>“Very likely; but nothing can excuse incivility. I have no doubt that she is excellent, since you all say so; but for my part I confess that an unpolished diamond has no charm for me. Poor Mr. Vandeleur! no wonder that he is so often from home.”</p>
<p>“Take care, my young friend,” said Lord Okehampton, good-naturedly, and laying a warning hand on her shoulder, “take care how you pity a man for his domestic troubles, and, believe me, Vandeleur is not unhappy.”</p>

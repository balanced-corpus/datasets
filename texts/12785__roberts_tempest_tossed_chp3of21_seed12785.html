<p>A farmer’s household is early astir, but young
Martin was up and about before anyone else
had awakened, in the cool, fresh October morning,
for he was not satisfied about Brindle, the cow, and
had it on his mind that she would want a warm mash before
morning. Martin was fond of all animals, and was
not only on the best of terms with all those about the farm,
but had that friendly understanding with wild ones which
seems born with certain people, as if they and the brute
creation had foudn out some means of bridging over the
mysterious gulf which seems set between man and the dumb
beasts, as he is apt to call them, much as the Greeks called
all who did not come of their race Barbarians, and the
Germans called the Italians “Welsh,” or mute.</p>

<p>Birds would come to Martin’s imitation of their call in
the woods, and squirrels run down the trunks of the trees
and sit up at his very feet to crack the nuts which he threw
to them. Even the shy little roe-deer, stealing out in the
dusk to nibble the tender shoots on the edge of the wood,
and casting timid looks on every side if so much as a leaf
dropped, would pause instead of runnign away if it caught
sight of Martin lying motionless on the sward.</p>

<p>Martin had a remarkable and characteristic power of
keeping still, and there no doubt lay part of the secret
creatures. At no time did his quiet, deliberate movements
suggest flurry or haste, and if the chose to watch
some shy animal, he would contentedly sit immovable for
half an hour at a time, perhaps observing the little birds
fluttering and bathing at the edge of a forest pool, a brown
wood-mouse running up and down the hollow stump to
which it was carrying the bits of grass and bents that it had
cut for its nest, or a lithe pine-marten leaping in the boughs
above his head. These things were a never-ceasing interest
and pleasure to Martin. There was in his character a
calm, self-reliant quietude, an habitual silence and meditativeness,
greatly fostered by a life in the country spent
much alone in peaceful field work, occupied with that
hard bodily toil which leaves little time for talk or thought,
but yet has spaces of leisure when the mind is free, and
the influences of the quiet sky and tranquil pastoral landscape
make themselves unconsciously felt.</p>

<p>Much of Martin’s slowness to apprehend anything
suddenly addressed to him arose from his habit of close
observation and absorption in whatever he happened to be
doing. He was either fully occupied in his work, or,
when apparently at leisure, was thinking over something
which he had seen. Every one laughed at him in the
family, and joked over his slowmindedness, but the whole
household unconsciously took it for granted that whatever
Martin advanced was certainly exact. His uncle’s name
for him was “Old Slow-and-sure,” and all knew that whatever
he took in hand would be thoroughly done, especially
if it related to the live stock.</p>

<p>Thus, when uncle and nephew had gone last thing on
the night of Dorner’s return to look at Brindle and her calf,
and Dorner had said, “The beast is not altogether right,”
Martin replied, “I see what she wants; I’ll look to her,”
the farmer had felt perfectly satisfied; and when he roused
up for a moment in the dawn, and heard a slight stir, he
said to himself, “That’s Martin looking after Brindle,” and
went to sleep again for another hour or two.</p>

<p>It was true that Martin had just then lighted the kitchen
fire, and set on the mash to heat, which he thought Brindle
required; but he was not the only one astir at that early
hour. As he stooped over the milk which he was pouring
into an earthenware pipkin, to warm for the calf, which
needed care as well as its mother, he heard a step come
stealing down the stairs, and looking round to see who was
there so early, recognized the girl whom his uncle had
brought home the evening before. Food and sound sleep
had greatly lessened the pallid, haggard look of the
previous night, and the lost, bewildered expression was
gone; her appearance, too, was greatly changed for the
better by her wearing the clothes provided by Dore instead
of her own tattered dress, but she was startlingly thin,
and there was a curious, concentrated look in her brown
eyes.</p>

<p>She started violently at the sight of Martin; but the lad,
entirely taken up with Brindle’s affairs, only nodded goodhumouredly,
saying, in a preoccupied, absent way—</p>

<p>“You are early afoot, maiden; have you had enough of
sleep already?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, in German much more refined than
Martin’s, though with the peculiar southern pronunciation
of the <i>u</i> which alone would have betrayed she was no
Thuringian. “Tell them I could not find my own clothes.”</p>

<p>Martin looked at her, and vaguely perceiving that Dore’s
bodice and petticoat had been cut for a much less slender
form than the present wearer’s, answered absently as he
stirred the mash—</p>

<p>“I warrant Dore or Rosel had yours in the wash long
since. I heard one of them say something of it. They
are not about yet—’tis full early.”</p>

<p>“Which is the way to Mühlbach?” asked the girl, standing
in the middle of the kitchen.</p>

<p>“To Mühlbach? Why, through the forest nine good
miles; less by the road by two or three, and it is a plain
road.”</p>

<p>“Where is the road?”</p>

<p>“You turn to the right as you leave the house, and cross
the bridge, taking the path down the left bank; then you
come to Alsdorf, and go straight through; after that ‘tis
easy enough,” he answered, with his thoughts all the while
on Brindle, though giving perfectly clear and correct information.
“Here—the mash is ready now. So—help
me with the milk; it is well you are here, for now we can
carry the poor beasts their mess together.”</p>

<p>He handed the milk to the girl, who stood hesitating
an instant, then saying abruptly, “It will not make
much difference,” she took the pitcher and crossed the
farm-yard with him, entering the- stable, full of the warm
breath of kine, and dim in the early morning, though a long
ray of dusty sunlight streamed in from a little window
across the stall where lay the cow and her calf who were
the objects of Martin’s solicitude.</p>

<p>Early autumn though it was, the cattle were brought
home every evening; these were not times to leave them
scattered in outlying pasturage. Not only they might have
been stolen, but wolves had strangely increased and multiplied
of late.</p>

<p>Theresa stood holding the milk, quietly waiting. She
had a purpose in view, on which her mind and will were
concentrated; but, unlike Martin at such times, her senses
were all on the alert, and she noticed how tenderly he
handled the sick cow, and how the creature turned grateful
speaking looks upon him, perfectly understanding that he
meant well by her and her calf, and evidently comforted by
his treatment.</p>

<p>He looked up presently with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“She will do,” he said, “there is no fear now, but last
night I did not like the look of it at all. And the calf is
all right this morning. It is a nice little thing. So, so,
my pretty one,” as he stroked the head laid against his arm as
if in thanks, “we shall have thee in the meadow again
before long. Poor beast! dost not like me to leave
thee? But, seest thou, there are Spot and Silverstar
and all the others to look to; and then I must be
off to mend the fence in the five-oak piece; who
knows what may get in else? Thanks, maiden; I
want no more help. You will find Dore and Rosel
afoot by now; I will be back shortly to fetch my breakfast.”</p>

<p>He went into the other stalls to satisfy himself that all
was right before he went away, and when he came out of
the stables he saw that Theresa had taken him at his
word, and was gone.</p>

<p>“That’s a town maiden,” he observed to himself. “I
doubt if she ever was in a cow stable before. She knew
nought of the beasts’ ways.” And having stored up this
fact in his mind, he collected the tools which he would
want to repair the broken fence, took his basket on his
shoulder, whistled for his dog Flink, and went back to the
house to fetch his breakfast.</p>

<p>Rosel came out of the dairy, open-mouthed. “Where
is the stranger girl?” she cried. “She is not in her bed
upstairs!”</p>

<p>“I should think not,” laughed Martin, “since she has
been in the stable helping me to feed Brindle and the calf.
Here, make haste, there’s a good lass. No one ever gives
me such good breakfasts as you!”</p>

<p>Rosel nodded and smiled. She was a merry lass of
twenty or thereabouts, and she had a great admiration for
her young master, none the less that he could be peremptory
and authoritative enough at times, and somehow never
forgot, good-humoured as he was and ready to take a joke,
that he <i>was</i> the young master and Dore and Rosel his
grandmother’s maids. She called to Dore in the kitchen
that the girl was all right, and somewhere about, and
Martin went off to his work at the far end of the farm.</p>

<p>He did not come home for some hours, not until the
family had gathered for dinner, all the household together,
men and maids, and the children of the married couples
who lived on the farm—a goodly assembly. Dame Martha
sat at the head of the board, occupying the tall chair in
which no one else ever ventured to sit. The very cats
knew that it was Dame Martha’s chair, and never dared
encroach on her special right to it.</p>

<p>“Well, uncle, I have done a good day’s work already.
I would not leave the fence till it was done, and that has
made me a bit late,” said Martin; “but dinner is a welcome
sight.”</p>

<p>“Sit down then, and fall to, lad,” said Dorner.</p>

<p>Martin obeyed, nothing loth. Presently, as if some
fragment of what was being talked of round him had
reached his brain, he stopped, looked round and asked,</p>

<p>Where’s Theresa?”</p>

<p>There was a half-smothered laugh among the servants;
Dore nudged Rosel, as they were apt to do when there was
a joke against “the young master,” and Dorner said,
smiling, but looking regretful, “Why, lad, gone. The girl
is gone. Hast heard nothing of what we have been saying?
I have asked thee twice already what thou couldst
tell of her, since it would seem thou saw’st her last.”</p>

<p>“Gone!” exclaimed Martin, who had been so lost in
considering how to protect the fields against a wild boar
which had been doing mischief among the crops that
autumn, that he had not even heard his uncle when directly
addressed, much less the discussion over the girl’s disappearance.
“Gone! when?”</p>

<p>“Nay; that I know not.”</p>

<p>“But how gone?” asked Martin, all bewilderment
“She was here this morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it appears you saw her, and told Rosel she was at
hand.”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” said Martin, more and more perplexed.</p>

<p>“Son,” interposed Dame Martha, severely, “why should
you seek to learn more of this girl?” She used the more
formal style of address to give additional weight to her
words. “It may be you had no choice but to have pity on
her. I judge you not, but the ungodly cannot abide the
ways of the elect, and she has left us of her own will; she
was a Papist and a theif and we are quit of her. Let us
be content, even though the hussy carried off Dore’s
Sunday clothes with her.”</p>

<p>No one, not even Martin, would have dared to interrupt
Dame Martha when she spoke so solemnly; but as soon as
she paused, Martin replied, concisely—

<p>“Her own were in the wash-tub. She sought them and
could not find them. She bade me say so.”</p>

<p>“But thou knew’st then that she was going away?”
Dorner asked in wonder; and even Dame Martha bent
forward almost as eagerly as the others to hear what Martin
could tell, though it was plain that he could not clear up
the mystery.</p>

<p>“No, how should I? She helped me to feed Brindle
and the calf, and then she went back to the house.”</p>

<p>“Nay, that she did not; we must have seen her,” cried
Dore and Rosel together.</p>

<p>“Well, old Slow-and-sure, it seems to me you have not
been a Solomon this time,” said Dorner.</p>

<p>Martin looked reflectively at Dore and Rosel, and pieced
things together.</p>

<p>“She asked me the way to Mühlbach,” he observed
slowly.</p>

<p>“To Mühlbach!” exclaimed Dorner, with a sound of
vexed dismay. “Can the wilful wench have gone back
there? Scarce could I force her away yesterday even;
she had some wild hopes her sister would return thither”</p>

<p>“Yes, she has gone there, and I am going to fetch her
back,” said Martin, deliberately. “Can I have Shag,
uncle? She can never walk there and back,” he added,
regardless of the general dissatisfaction which his announcement
aroused.</p>

<p>“There and back! a thousand to one she never so
much as gets there,” said Dorner, much disturbed. “A
girl alone on the high road in these times; or if she find
the wood she will certainly lose her way and starve. Lad,
didst never think to ask thyself wherefore she was astir so
early, and why she wanted to know the road to Mühlbach?”</p>

<p>“I had other gear on hand,” answered Martin, raising a
laugh by the characteristic answer. “But I shall find her
and bring her back.”</p>

<p>“I know not if I ought to let thee go, boy. There are
perils enough at hand without going to seek them. No, I
will go myself.”</p>

<p>“Bethink thee what you do, son Martin,” repeated the
warning voice of Dame Martha.</p>

<p>“I will go with right good will, master,” said one of the
farmer’s men.</p>

<p>“I am going myself,” said Martin, calmly. “I let her
slip away, and it is for me to bring her back again.”</p>

<p>“God speed you then, lad,” said his uncle. “But art
sure of the road? Tis long since thou wentest to Mühlbach,
but I know thou canst always remember a way thou
hast once been.”</p>

<p>Martin nodded and left the room, to fetch Shag, and fill
a basket with food. Dore and Rosel must have strongly
disapproved of his proceedings, since neither offered to
help him. He came back again to fetch a pistol, hanging
on the wall with other weapons, and then rode off, at a
quiet steady pace, which betokened neither hurry nor
anxiety, but only a sturdy resolution to carry out his purpose
without needless delay.</p>

<p>“I wish he may find the girl. Poor, wilful maiden, she
is crazed with trouble,” said Dorner, his kind blue eyes
growing moist.</p>

<p>“Said I not she would bring trouble on our household!”
said Dame Martha, rising from her seat, and looking after
Martin as he rode away. “Here, already, the lad runs
into danger for her sake, while for aught we know she has
gone to bring an enemy upon us.”</p>

<p>There was a murmur of consternation among the
listeners, and instead of dispersing to their work, as they
had been about to do, they turned back in the doorway to
listen.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, that is a groundless fear, good mother,” said
Dorner; “neither kith nor kin are left to the girl, nor can
we have aught to fear from them if there be any living.
Why, since when have we been at feud with the men of
Mühlbach?”</p>

<p>Dame Martha made no reply, but somehow, in her
obstinate mind, she mixed up the stranger and the
plunderers who had destroyed Mühlbach, and having
admitted this idea, supported by a certain foreign air about
Theresa, it took root, as unreasonable ideas will do in
narrow and prejudiced minds which have little to vary their
mental food.</p>

<p>“Come, men,” said Dorner, cheerily, “we cannot spend
all the afternoon idling here because a silly wench has run
away; we should be back at our work by now.”</p>

<p>And he set the example by returning to the barn,
whence the sound of his flail was soon heard. The two
maids cleared the long table, and went hither and thither,
having little chance of chattering together over what had
taken place, as they would fain have done, had not the
keen eyes of Dame Martha been constantly upon them.
The clock ticked as the hours went by, each bringing its
appointed task in the busy farmer’s household, and so the
day went on just as usual; but every one thought more or
less of the event which had stirred so much the usual
course of their quiet lives; and about Martin and his
journey, and of the stranger, who, as it seemed to these
simple folk, had so ungratefully and unaccountably quitted
the kindly refuge offered her.</p>

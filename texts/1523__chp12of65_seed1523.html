<p>Sir Blaise had lived the life of a hermit—making due allowance for an <i>entourage</i> which left nothing to be desired—for three months. He had not, it is true, looked out on four bare walls, told his beads, lain prostrate on a damp floor, resorted to rigorous penance, abstained from meats; those outward signs of an inward struggle had not been his. None the less he had looked inwards for the first time at his Ill spiritual structure (for, pass by the <i>fact</i> as we may, each one of us holds within us two worlds, the one terrestrial, the other celestial; we are linked, indissolubly linked, with the latter, temporarily with the former; yet to behold us, one would think surely the reverse must be the case); and had seen a strange procession sweep up and down within those four walls. Sir Blaise could hardly lay the pleasing unction to his soul which is the peculiar quackery the poor man plasters <i>his</i> soul withal—”I never does no harm to nobody, and I does what I can.”</p>
 <p>No, no; there were a great many flies in the apothecary’s ointment. When death had gripped him, those “flies,” how they tormented him! All the same, he was floundering about in hopeless confusion—a confusion as helpless as befalls an amateur when flung into the ocean by an expert.</p>
<p>Books of theology presented themselves before him, and he read them ; hard facts, uncompromising truths, hammer and nail, screw and pickaxe.</p>
<p>Sir Blaise sat in the library at Whitefriars with the pale winter sunbeams chasing each other over the open pages, as if to caress his quest, and to promise light. When a man thus sits down deliberately to find out his God, and to face the mystery of his being, how godlike he seems!</p> 
<p>Meantime the county commenced to be seriously curious about Sir Blaise. Was he going to retire for ever from all society? He had thrown up the mastership of the hounds,—the first step in that direction. Sir Blaise give up hunting! He whose “Tally-ho” was like the glorious cry of some Nimrod, was he going to turn Whitefriars into a monastery? Was he going to follow in the footsteps of
Father Ignatius? Pity was, Whitefriars had been restored; it would have carried out past traditions far better in its ancient guise. Was Father Ignatius at the bottom of it? Sir Blaise had been at Brighton not long ago, and the Father was there at the same time. By-the-bye, what had taken Sir Blaise to Brighton? These invulnerables always caught it in the end, and that pretty severely; it must be “love.”</p>
<p>Yes, it was love. They were quite sure it was love; when a man turns recluse, be sure love is at the bottom of it. Nothing else will drive him to such extremes. Money loss will sour a man up, and he will perhaps fly the country, or go about with a dogleaved lip, and throw <i>couleur de jaune</i> on everything, but he won’t shut himself up. No, ‘tis love makes people cry, “Muffles! Muffles! Tie up the knocker. Say I am sick; nay, further, dead.” ‘Tis love consorts with ashes and embosoms solitude—love which glowers and maddens and wreathes and twists. Yes, yes!</p>
<p>Miss Edwards, the Doctor’s sister, had perhaps heard all about it—the county must really ask her to luncheon. So Miss Edwards received an invasion of notes, and looked unutterables, and read up <i>Beeton’s Universal</i>, and plastered her hair in straight lines on either side till the parting widened terribly, and wore “kids” at bedtime to get her hands as white as Lady Masters’s, and went forth scrub and brush and cram to her luncheons.</p>
<p>That she had <i>no</i> information was her own information; she was to be feasted, and she must bring a “dole” for that feasting. That her brother was reticent—madly reticent—was not her fault; that he never gave her the smallest iota of information concerning his patients was the fault of that mad reticence. Oh that he were like dear old Doctor Gosling, the allopathic and general practitioner, who was brimming over with details and <i>on dits</i> about other people’s patients, to say nothing of illustrated volumes concerning his own.</p> 
<p>The Doctor—for it was thus Miss Edwards named her brother, even in thought—was buttoned up in silence. If he would but take her advice, and study <i>Beeton</i>, he would be able to hold his own and show up as she. Where would she be without the <i>Universal</i>? Beneath the heel of everybody. As it was, she could fetch and carry for picked intellects, for even <i>these</i> get hazy now and then over dates and birth-places, and so on. Miss Edwards went the round of her luncheons, and flew a kite, and then recovered it to fly it a yard or two farther. She rather enjoyed this kite-flying, for the eyes of the county were looking on, the weather all that could be desired, and the kite, <i>enfin</i> flying up in a gale of hurry to descend in a dead calm.”</p>
<p>Stupid old thing!” said Francisca (for it was especially at the Masters’s she had displayed her powers); “the ‘<i>stoopidest</i>‘ old thing that ever came cackling into creation. She knows nothing at all about the matter. Doctor Edwards is not likely to give his patients’ secrets up for her to arrange them into mother tinctures, and distil them in globules and pilules.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Lady Masters meditatively, “Doctor Edwards carries the key to this extraordinary seclusion on the part of Sir Blaise. Medical men become a species of Father Confessor.”</p>
<p>“Medical pets,” said Francisca; “from one pulse to another—that is the way with most young ladies—myself excluded. But very lively people, such as myself, seldom have a pulse.”</p>
<p>Cecilia looked down. Francisca was so terribly straight; but then Mr. Languedoc had never sat at <i>her</i> feet, with eyes full of dreams, repeating <i>Mariana in the South</i>. Would Francisca have come throuo-h such a o moment as that, and still find herself without a pulse? Was it not enough to give anybody a wild pulse? Cecilia was smiling pensively, and Lady Masters, glancing at her, had a vision of Mr. Languedoc’s pale eyes, long hair, and slight form—through which Cecilia declared the moon looked. She drew up her figure bracingly, and said—</p>
<p>“Cecilia, what of your <i>tonic-sol-fa</i>? Persistent practice is the only method of cultivating the <i>vox humana</i>.”</p>
<p>What peculiar noises we do make through the medium of our <i>vox humanas!</i>” said Francisca. “Neighing and braying, and bahing and crowing, each of us carries our duplicate animal somewhere. My last idea is to make a collection of the afflictive human noises I have heard. I shall call it the most original <i>onic-sol-fa</i><!-- reads onic-sol-fa in original, not tonic-sol-fa --> on record. It will include Mr. Baldock’s ‘bray,’ and Mrs. Vesey’s ‘wee-wee,’ Count Gleiker’s ‘surprise snort,’ and Professor Tweedie’s scientifical ‘snuffles.’ I shall label them neatly, and write beneath—’Contributions gladly received.’” </p>
<p>“My dear Francisca, how will you cage the sounds?” said Lady Masters laughing.</p>
<p>“How does Edison cage everything? I intend to rival Edison. Are you quite sure there is no commercial blood in our veins, no intervening streamlets to break the flow and take the prose out of us? Where does Cecilia get her hereditary <i>nocturnes</i> in blue and silver? Where does Miss Beauchamp get her dramatic power and Bohemian ways ? Where has Sir Blaise found an interpreter to solitude? And, lastly—where, oh! where, has Miss Edwards derived her knowledge of all things?”</p>

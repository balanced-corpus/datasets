Rosy at Havenport.
</p>
<p>
“To have her lion roll in a silken net,<br>
And fawn at a victor’s feet.”<br>
Tennyson.
</p>
</div>
<p>
The wedding was over, the bride and bridegroom were travelling to Norway, the house in the terrace was quiet 
again after the excitement and gaiety incident upon the marriage, and Lady Maud felt restful, placid, and content.
</p>
<p>
Constance, too, was singularly at peace, and wonderfully lazy and idle for her. Since the change had come over 
her weary, straining nature, her painting even had become to her a mere secondary interest, instead of the solace, 
the refuge she had formerly clung to so selfishly, evoting the best affection of which her heart was capable 
upon the art which after all did not really satisfy her craving—recompensing only slightly for the time, 
and thought, and love she lavished upon the cultivation of her talent.
</p>
<p> 
How gloriously happy to her were the first weeks of that lovely autumn weather which followed the memorable 
season when she first knew Alfred Hastings—knew him for the friend she thought he believed himself, knew 
him for a man superior in mental powers, health of moral tone and character to any other she had ever met 
or dreamed about!
</p>
<p> 
It is difficult to describe his feelings with regard to her at this period. When he had seen her first, after 
his last return from India, his mind was still full of the idealistic admiration for her beautiful sister, 
which had occupied it dreamily for the last ten years.
</p>
<p>  
Laura had only been a child when he had fallen in love with her beauty, ten years ago, and yet her image 
had had power to keep itself in his memory for all that time, nothing had been able to depose it until 
his return to England, when he had become almost immediately <em>désillusionné,</em> and scoffed at himself 
for having kept a woman’s picture in his heart and in his brain so long, never thinking but that he should 
return to find her again exactly what he had dreamed her.
</p>
<p>
But when does unspoken love, when unreciprocated, long continue to trouble any breast in these days of 
worldly selfishness and common sense?
</p>
<p>
Before the days of chivalry were over, believe it, men had ceased to die for love, or live only on the 
memory or hope of a smile, a word, or glance—
</p>

</p>

is a principle more or less of every human being; except, of course, in such instances as the object of our 
sometime adoration bestowing all the love we once thought we could not be happy without, upon our greatest 
aversion or our deadliest enemy.
</p>
<p>
Now Arthur Fane, without being in the least a subject of detestation, or even of moderate dislike, to 
his cousin, had been his rock ahead throughout his life—I mean in the matter of Mr. Brereton’s regard 
for his two nephews. It was only natural then, that Colonel Hastings should have been sensible of a 
feeling that he wished fate had chosen any other husband for his shattered idol.
</p>
<p>
Yet this little jealous sensation was only very shortlived. Long ere Constance thought it he had come 
to know that he could witness his rival’s happiness without compunction, and ungrudgingly, indifferently 
think about the engagement.
</p>
<p>
But with such feelings as his, firstly of unrealized dreams, and then ruffled pride, followed by a sort 
of blank disbelief in passion or attachment, at any rate so far as he himself was concerned, Constance 
did not directly stand a very good chance of gaining a favourable place in his opinion, notwithstanding 
the fact that he had been irresistibly attracted towards her from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
It would have been impossible for any one not owning to an engrossing love for another woman to have felt 
no interest in Constance Latimer, thrown into her society in such a manner as Hastings had been. Despite 
her cool repellant mood, which had piqued him from the very first, she had soon warmed into what he 
believed for a little while to be affectation, and then speedily had changed his opinion into thinking 
that if anything about her was affected, it was her chill reserve and <em>hauteur,</em> which sometimes 
wrapped itself so close around her, and prevented half the world from knowing her for what she was—a 
sweet, clinging woman, deeply feeling, truly loving; a woman with soul, mind, and aspirations far above 
many and many an one who is universally beloved, and has the credit of being all that compound of gentleness, 
trust, and affection, which is supposed to go towards the making of a perfect woman.
</p>
<p> 
While everything that was good in Constance’s nature was becoming ripened and, beautified by the happiness 
of her new emotion, Love, that great lottery in which so many draw blanks, was working another kind of 
change in the slighter nature of Rosy Halliday.
</p>
<p> 
It is quite impossible—at least, I think it is quite impossible—that any one could live so thoroughly 
in the world, and in so fascinating a kind of society as that in which the Hallidays moved, without being 
tainted by society’s chief fault, for which I can find no other name than the everlastingly-used one of 
worldliness.
</p>
<p> 
Gay Rosy was as worldly as most of her sex; vanity and love of amusement were the ruling passions of her 
life, and had been so ever since she was able to speak, and win by her sweet manners and radiant beauty, 
the admiration she so much delighted in.
</p>
<p> 
Until she had known Fritz and fallen in love with him, the dream of her life had been to make a truly 
advantageous marriage in a worldly sense. The floating phantoms of a title, unlimited pin-money, the 
possession of an opera-box, estates in the country, carriages, and liveried servants, had of late faded 
very much; though she had not gone so far as to allow visions of married penury, with Fritz in shabby 
boots, and herself in dowdy gowns and mended gloves, entirely to replace them. The powdered footmen, 
Belgravian mansion and society came to the front whenever Fritz had been less loverlike, or more negligent 
in his demeanour than usual; and by the time she had spent three weeks at Havenport, a stronger feeling 
than that of mere selfish worldliness had possession of her whole being. A hard fierce spirit of wounded 
pride and vanity seized her; a firm determination to live down the love which she had found so sweet; an 
unreasonable conviction that she had been deceived by a handsome face, a pleasant manner, and a winning 
tongue, as so many women had been before her, but as she had believed herself strong enough to resist.
</p>
<p> 
Is it strange that with the dreary example before us of many a weak and trusting sister’s heart being 
broken, and lives blurred and saddened by the selfish thoughtlessness, if not designed cruelty of men, 
we should fear to trust the sweeter instincts, the better promptings, of our hearts? For doubting the merely 
hinted love of Fritz, I do not think Rosy deserved much blame. She was a flirt herself, and she had 
associated with male coquets every whit as clever in the petty, yet dangerously captivating art of 
badinage and sham lovemaking as she was. Considering her popularity indeed, it may be thought a little 
strange that nobody had ever roused a tender spark within her bosom until country Fritz appeared and 
won her whole heart. No; I think she had reason and excuse enough for fearing that she had placed her 
love unwisely. The censure, for censure she deserves, was for her conduct subsequently, when, removed 
from all chance of meeting him and so growing into belief of the love she wanted, she tried to drown 
all memory of him, and of the dear, happy days of their acquaintance. She coquetted recklessly, far 
more recklessly than in London, with every single being she met; often talking more nonsense than she 
well knew; saying a great deal that she would much wish to recall if she had ever been calm or collected 
enough to think over and remember what she had said or done.
</p>
<p>  
People at Havenport were rather surprised at this wild, daring, beautiful madcap that Lady Maud Latimer 
had picked up in London, and marvelled greatly at the affection which the staid Constance appeared to 
entertain for her.
</p>
<p> 
In the autumn there was always a great amount of gaiety in the place, picnics, regattas, garrison 
balls, and so forth; and so Rosy was very much seen and commented upon. Constance found no monotony 
in the annual excitement this year, with Colonel Hastings lingering on, making everything <em>couleur 
de rose</em> for her. As for Lady Maud, she did not attempt very much. Her delicate constitution had 
been sorely tried by the London season, and she really required rest now; so the girls usually went 
out under the <em>chaperonage</em> of the wife of a colonel in Artillery, whose battery was stationed 
at Havenport—a gay, pleasure-loving dame, whose propriety was not too much shocked by Miss Rosy 
Halliday’s flirting propensities.
</p>
<p>
It was one sunny August morning, when the weather seemed too bright and lovely for any one to waste 
its beauty by remaining indoors; and Constance and Rosy, fatigued by a long and merry excursion they 
had taken the previous day with a large party, sauntered out upon the cliffs to be roused and invigorated 
by the sea breezes.
</p>
<p> 
Choosing out a spot where a great projecting piece of the red rock formed a kind of natural canopy to 
shelter them from the heat of the sun, and where some public-spirited Havenportian had established a 
bench of tolerable comfort, from which a good view of the exquisite bay of Havenport was obtained, the 
two girls settled themselves snugly, each with a book in her hand, though neither of them felt very 
well up to anything deeper or more improving to the mind than a good chattering match about the various 
things they had been doing, and the people they had lately met.
</p>
<p> 
Constance had made a hundred sketches already from that point, or she would have had her drawing materials 
with her, and so looked as though she were being industrious. As it was, she merely appeared like Rosy, 
a very charming picture of lazy idleness, her grey eyes half closed, her graceful figure leaning against 
the dark, hard cliff, which formed a well-chosen background for showing off the contour of the beautiful 
little face and head.
</p>
<p> 
There was a look of rest and happiness in Constance’s expression now; not so with her companion. Rosy, 
beautiful as ever, gayer, more captivating, would not have conveyed an idea of being perfectly contented 
and at ease to one skilled in physiognomy, had her face been studied that morning. There was excitement 
in the bright, large eyes, a feverish look in her red lips, her laugh too frequent for real merriment, an 
impatience in every movement of her hands or body.
</p>
<p>
She had by this time schooled herself into a sham belief that she had outlived her passing <em>tendresse</em> 
for Fritz; but she was not false enough yet to believe that the great hollow gap, which she herself had 
forced in her heart, was being filled by any other image, much as she longed for the relief which such 
a circumstance would bring.
</p>
<p> 
This story would be too long if every event in it were minutely recorded in detail; and Laura’s marriage 
has been passed over, and with it one fact, trivial enough in itself, but all important, inasmuch as what 
resulted from it was to change the whole current of one person’s being; that is, the introduction of 
Donald Latimer to Rosy.
</p>
<p> 
When she came to look back, she never could tell when she first became sensible that this uncouth Hercules, 
of whose dull awkwardness she had been given such descriptions, had placed his neck beneath her foot. She 
had met him first on the day of the wedding, when she had regarded him with interest because of his being 
Fritz’s friend, and he had sometimes told her how fond he was of him. She had smiled on him and spoken 
graciously, because it was her nature so to do and she could not help it; but there had been no thought, 
no notion of conquest or coquetry in her head.
</p>
<p>
That is to say at first, until she came to see that her eyes and voice possessed a power over him; that 
he was very different in his bearing towards her from the accounts she had listened to of his manners; 
and that as days went on he came constantly to the house, and the others remarked “that Donald was softening 
down; that somehow or other he improved between each visit.”
</p>
<p>
It was not very long before the reason of his improvement became obvious to the meanest understanding. 
Lady Maud even was gently jocose about him to her young guest; and Constance, though very much amused 
at it, was sensible of a half-wish that Rosy had confined her attractions to trifling with the hearts of 
the garrison, and spared this unsophisticated fellow, for Fritz’s sake. She knew that the boy sincerely 
loved his friend, and would be sorry that he should be made unhappy by any one, but more especially by 
the girl on whom his own heart was set; and she had a sort of fancy, that was not strange, that no good 
could come of their both loving Rosy at the same time.
</p>
<p> 
Fritz wrote every now and then to Constance, and no letter was without mention of Rosy; but it was always 
of a kind impossible for her to repeat whilst still doubtful whether she loved him or no. So Rosy, who was 
familiar enough with her lover’s handwriting, saw his letters arrive, and watched Constance reading them 
at breakfast time, angrily believing that he thought nothing about her, or merely remembered her in the 
casual manner in which people think of their friends at the close of a letter—”My fondest love to Lady 
Maud, and kind regards to Miss Röschen.” So he often used to call her in imitation of Herr Schulz.
</p>
<p> 
Constance would read aloud selections from his epistles, and when she came to the close, Rosy, who had 
pretended to be absorbed in her own correspondence, would look up and ask unconcernedly, “Oh! have you 
heard from the beautiful baby baritone; how is he?” when, in reality she had been listening from behind 
the pages of Florence’s letter, with all her ears to every word Constance had said.
</p>
<p>
Such had been the case this very morning; and Constance, all truth herself, could not suspect the 
ridiculous acting of the other girl. Believing that she cared no more for Fritz than for the rest 
of her tribe of hoverers, how was it possible to read her such sentences as—
</p>
<p>
“Be sure you write and tell me about every one who admires her. I don’t mind fellows making fools of 
themselves a bit, to amuse her, as long as I can believe she does not care for any of them more 
than me. Oh, Con, don’t you think she likes me better than any one else? Does she ever talk about 
me? Don’t tell her what an idiotic ass I am about her. I love her better than all the world?”
</p>
<p>
Poor Fritz, and poor Rosy! Their love was strong and powerful, but their pride was deeper than 
their love, as is generally the case; and pride was making them both miserable.
</p>
<p> 
If only Constance had had more knowledge of human nature, or if the experience which was so soon 
to come to her in her own case could have been hastened, and so aided and served her in this 
present instance! But of course it is vain and foolish to talk like this; and I must not be 
anticipating whilst the girls sit waiting in the fresh warm air, and Rosy impatient of even 
a moment’s silence chatters away, flying from subject to subject; but ever and anon, like the 
butterfly she was, returning to one particular topic, the picnic and dance of the previous day, 
where, amongst her many admirers, Donald Latimer had been conspicuous for the devotedness of 
his homage, and his utter happiness at the more than ever sweetly gracious manner in which his 
sovereign had treated him.
</p>
<p> 
“Do you know, dear,” Rosy said with a blush, “I never flirted with any man who gave me such 
amusement as that big cousin of yours. How it is that neither you nor Laura ever took him 
up, I cannot think. He is, oh! such fun, and very clever. You never would believe it, I know, 
but you should only hear him talk when he gets alone with you.”
</p>
<p> 
“I am very glad that you find him pleasant,” answered Constance, a trifle drily. “But I certainly 
never should have given him credit for possessing any genius whatever—except that Fritz is fond 
of him.”
</p>
<p> 
As she mentioned his name she looked at her friend. Rosy was gazing unconcernedly into space, 
and the pink of her bright cheeks had not deepened in tint; assuredly her heart seemed perfectly untouched.
</p>
<p> 
“Oh!” she said, after a moment’s pause, “the B. B. B. does not always care about people being 
clever. Why, at our house, no matter how many lions mama introduced to him, he liked flirting 
with poor silly <em>me</em> better than anything—except singing. However, Don Latimer <em>is</em> clever, 
and he knows how to pay compliments better than half the lady-killers in the world; and <em>I</em> call 
him good-looking in a queer sort of way, with his nice green eyes, and beaky old nose. Mark 
my words Constance, if he comes to London in the winter (and I’ve been pressing him to, 
tremendously), he’ll be desperately run after at our eveningsand won’t mama want to model him!”
</p>
<p> 
In spite of the annoyance she could not help feeling at what appeared heartless insensibility on 
the part of Rosy, Constance could not help laughing.
</p>
<p>
“Have a care, you Queen of Coquettes,” she said, laying her little hand on the other’s shoulder. 
“You have broken, at least cracked and scratched, several hearts in your short day, but your 
own time must come at last. Why, even Van Amburgh, that famous beast-tamer, was one day killed 
by one of his lions. I should like to see you fearfully in love, Röslein; but it would be too 
great a joke if my tall red-haired cousin proved the one to win you.”
</p>
<p>
Rosy’s cheeks were crimson enough now; but it was not, as Constance half imagined, from the 
dawning of a passion of which she had been heretofore insensible. No, Rosy at that minute cared 
no more for Donald’s deeply-growing love, than she had ever thought of the worship of Herr 
Schulz, or any other of her miscellaneous admirers. But she was too worldly, and knew the 
discomforts of poverty far too well not to have remembered, as Constance spoke, that this last 
adorer was the heir to a baronetcy and already possessor of a large fortune.
</p>
<p> 
Yet the blood which had mantled in her cheeks left them almost as speedily as it had rushed 
there, as her better feelings gained preeminence, and she remembered that Donald was the best 
friend of the man who must always occupy a sort of sacred place in her memory, because he was 
her first love, although it was her will and wisdom to believe now that his love for her had 
never been anything but a fancy on her own part, or a prettily-acted little pastime on that of Fritz.
</p>
<p> 
“Oh, please don’t talk of my being in love!” she cried, petulantly; “it would be far too dreadful 
for me to make such an ape of myself yet awhile. I must have some more fun. Don’t you want 
to hear Florence’s note? You always care for our home news; not that there is very much to 
tell though, now;” and Rosy proceeded to unfold and read her sister’s letter.
</p>
<div>
<!-- My dearest is left justified, the next part is indented just slightly more than a normal paragraph on the first line-->
<p>
“My dearest Rosy,<br>
“We are so glad to hear that you are enjoying yourself so much. I am sure your visit will do you 
a great deal of good; you were wanting a change, for I never saw you look so knocked up as you 
did a month ago. Nothing has happened much since I last wrote. Mama and Ralph are still at 
Brighton. I don’t think I shall go away: I don’t care much about the sea, and the house always 
gets turned upside down in my absence. It is very hot in London, and poor grandpapa is feeling 
it rather; but he will not join mama until his picture is finished for the Duke of Blankmore-St. George. 
The likeness to Mr. Fabian is capital, though he only gave a few sittings. Every one is wanting 
to paint him, and I am afraid he must get conceited in time; but he is still as nice as ever, 
and comes here constantly now there is no grand visiting to take up his time.”
</p>
</div>
<p> 
Rosy read all this quickly and coolly, thinking to herself, “Ah! he finds the Crescent every bit 
as nice without me.”
</p>
<p> 
“Miss Forsyth seems very happy and well,” the letter went on; “though it is rather a pity she does 
not go away for change of air. Alice continues to get on very nicely with the servants, which 
is a good thing; but somehow I don’t like her, she gives me a notion of being sly. I don’t know 
whether Lady Maud would care, but I believe Miss Forsyth’s reason for not wanting to go away 
is that she has taken up a great mania for the Oratory. First of all she went with grandpapa; but 
now he is not quite well enough to walk out she goes every day by herself. She is so good-natured, 
never any trouble, and every one likes her.”
</p>
<p>
“What a mercy!” interposed Constance. Rosy went on—
</p>
<p>
“Herr Schulz has composed such a pretty <em>Bourrée.</em> I hope it will get published. Nobody 
came last Saturday except Mr. Fabian and der Herr; but they made it very pleasant: the B.B.B. 
sang so beautifully. The boys are quite well. Grandpapa sends his dear love. Please give 
mine to Lady Maud and Constance, as well as to yourself, my darling.
</p>
<div>
<!-- Farewell is right justified with reverse indent on first line, P.S. has extra line break before next paragraph -->
<p>
“Ever your affectionate<br>
“Florence Halliday.</p>
<p>“P.S.—I hope your new dresses are wearing well, and you take care of your things.”<br>
</p>
</div>
<p>
“There—blessed old Flo!” said Rosy when she had finished. “Isn’t she good to be sticking at 
home with not a soul in town to come on Saturdays? How funny about your aunt and the Oratory! 
I thought she used to go there because she liked to carry on with Benny rather, the sweet 
little dear. Come, it is dull work sitting here with no one passing by. Let us go up to the 
top again, or else climb down these dreadful steps and get to the sad sea waves.”
</p>
<p> 
“Not down to the beach, Röslein, if you wish for company—we shall not meet a soul there, 
and shall only have to clamber up again in the heat. How restless you are, you are always 
wanting people and excitement! I am sure this nook is worth more, with the lovely sea to 
look at, than all the people in the world—nearly. You are just like Cleopatra, in ‘The 
Dream of Fair Women’—
</p>
<div>
<!-- very small text, center justified -->
<p>
‘There are no men to govern in this wood,<br>
That makes my only woe.’
</p>
</div>
<p>
“Oh, Constance! What a heavenly quotation! Is that really darling Tennyson? I haven’t read 
‘A Dream of Fair Women’ all through, because I never could make out who they are all meant 
for. But <em>won’t</em> I look out those lines, and quote them when next we go to a dreadfully slow 
party—an awful kettledrum, with nothing but ladies!”
</p>
<p> 
Constance laughed, and ere her amusement subsided said—
</p>
<p>
“I think your discontent at ‘<em>this wood</em>‘ will vanish in a minute, for I perceive two 
<em>male</em>-clad forms coming round the corner, and if I am not much mistaken I recognise 
the villainously-cut clothes of Don Latimer. Yes; and the other—why, surely it is Dick Fabian, 
Fritz’s brother!”
</p>
<p>
Fritz’s brother! Very good; it was the brother he was most fond of. He corresponded with him 
sometimes, Rosy knew that. Doubtless this Dick was aware that a poor foolish girl called Rosy 
Halliday was hopelessly in love with his youngest brother.
</p>
<p>
“Il verra!” she said to herself, feeling very grand, and never considering for an instant that 
perhaps it might be she was only a very silly little girl.
</p>
<p> 
“Oh, Mr. Latimer!” she greeted Donald with, as she sprang from the ground where she had been 
sitting at Constance’s feet, and stretched out both her hands. “We are so glad to see you, at 
least <em>I</em> am. Constance and I were getting so sleepy, and now you can stop and enliven us, can’t 
you? What happy accident brought you here?”
</p>
<p> 
She had to wait for the answer to her question until Constance had touched her on the arm to 
remind her that a stranger was present to whom it was but natural that she should be introduced.
</p>
<p> 
She bowed in a little absent way, rather as if the name of Fabian was one with which she was 
familiar, as she was with that of Tomkins, or Robinson, but could not exactly recall any one 
particular member of a family bearing the appellation. Then she moved a few paces away, smiling 
on Donald all the while, as he replied to her, lowering his voice—
</p>
<p>
“It was no accident. I knew you often came here of a morning, and it was too early to go to the 
Terrace, so I managed to be walking this way so as not to miss a chance of seeing you, and I 
am rewarded for my manœuvring. Do you not think me a fool?” 
</p>
<p>
“No,” she said, with a quaint little shake of her head. “Ladies’ society is very good for 
young men who have no sisters: if I were you I should cultivate it.”
</p>
<p>
“But ladies do not usually take the trouble to talk to me, and I was such an unlicked 
cub before—till just a little while since, that I did not care to talk to them.”
</p>
<p> 
“Astonishing!” Rosy cried, opening her eyes. “And you talk so well too. Is it a fearful bore 
to you to be talking to me now, Mr. Latimer?”
</p>
<p>
“You know it is not. You know, I am certain you know, or else what I have ever heard of the 
power and judgment of women is a lie, you know that from the first moment you spoke to me, 
when we drove back from church at Laura’s wedding, and I trode on your frock, that you assumed 
in my eyes a different form from any other creature I had ever seen. Look you, Miss Halliday, 
you are making a human being of me instead of a brute—what do you think of your skill?”
</p>
<p>
They were so far apart from the others now, who were still sitting in Constance’s favourite 
retreat, that they were to all intents and purposes alone, as far as mere speech went. But 
Rosy, startled at the warm depth of passion in Donald’s voice, feared lest the earnest fervour 
of his manner should strike them too forcibly, and answered lightly, whilst she did not dare 
to look up in his face:
</p>
<p> 
“I think you will make me very conceited, to begin with, and that it is very silly of nobody 
else to have drawn you out—if what you say is true; that is what I think.”
</p>
<p> 
She could not tell which she dreaded most—a more formal and decided declaration of his love 
from this man; or that a stronger feeling was taking possession of her, a longing to believe 
in him, and reward the strength and freshness of his passion by yielding up to him a 
part of her affection.
</p>
<p> 
She could love him just as much as Benny and Florence, her mother and the boys. “Oh, if I had 
met him sooner I might have cared for him ever so much,” she thought, as Fritz’s image hovered 
before her mind, and made her shudder at herself.
</p>
<p> 
But there was Fritz’s brother to deceive, and she must not weary in her work. Weary! when would 
Rosy ever have wearied of a flirtation ? There, at that moment, if all had been happily settled 
between Fritz and herself, I doubt whether she could have resisted subjugating Donald Latimer 
during the absence of her love. Donald went on—
</p>
<p>
“Is it a pleasure to you to know that you are the first, the only one for whom I have ever thought 
as I do of you? I think it must be so. It is a delight to a fellow, a sportsman I mean, to 
bring down each bird at which he levels his gun; and the love of sport is so inherent in human—in 
all animal nature, that I think it must be the same to a woman, to bag every heart she comes 
across, as men do pheasants.”
</p>
<p> 
“How well you talk!” Rosy cried with enthusiasm. But her compliment sounded rather like sarcasm; 
for Donald did not talk well, it was only the sense of his words that pleased her, as his speech 
was rambling and too hastily uttered.
</p>
<p> 
But she really was getting to admire this rough, self-taught, half hermit of a man, whose knowledge 
of life was so limited, or learnt only from his father and young Fritz; he had had but very slight 
intercourse with any other fellow-creatures.
</p>
<p>
Believing that Dick Fabian was watching and commenting upon her behaviour, Rosy extended her 
promenade by a few more yards, and continued to draw Donald out and charm him with her sweetness 
yet more and more, if a deeper fascination were possible for him.
</p>
<p> 
She was mistaken however in thinking that her conduct was having great effect on the brother 
of the man she loved. Dick Fabian had thought her a very pretty girl just for the two seconds 
during which he had met her face whilst Constance introduced them to each other, but nothing 
else. There was one image generally present in the mind of the young Engineer Lieutenant. He 
had loved Laura Latimer fondly, passionately; and knowing her for heartless, at least so far 
as he was concerned, he was of a mind to own no woman in the world lovable, or even beautiful.
</p>
<p> 
Yet he could not but think as he sat talking with her, the same as many an one had thought of 
late, that Constance had marvellously improved in looks, and was a very charming and agreeable girl.
</p>
<p>
“And what brings you home, Dick? “Constance asked him, as soon as the first greetings were over. 
“Surely it is quite unexpected?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied the young soldier, “I only came down yesterday night. The fact is, Jones was a 
little uneasy about my father, and wrote to me to get leave if I could. I am very glad I did come, 
for I don’t like his looks; and the reason you see me now is that I have come over to get Dr. 
Conway. The Rabiegh apothecary is all very well for old women and babies, but I don’t feel 
satisfied that he understands the dear old governor.”
</p>
<p>
“You came in by train, I suppose.”
</p>
<p> 
“Yes; and we can’t get back till three o’clock. I thought we should be quicker in the train than 
by road, but there are so few to return by. I met Don Latimer as I drove to Trevor Bridge 
Station, and asked him to come with me. What a nice fellow he is!”
</p>
<p> 
“So people are beginning to find out,” Constance said, in a little surprise. She supposed that 
she and her sister must have been heretofore very stupidly blind as to their cousin’s agreeable 
qualities. “Fritz always was fond of him,” she went on. “By the way, have you seen anything 
of Fritz.”
</p>
<p>
“He came down to see me at Chatham a few Sundays ago. He seems to have been going it. I looked at his 
engagement book, and found he has got acquainted with half the people in London. But he is such a handsome 
fellow.” Dick said this with rather a sigh. He himself was not handsome; indeed beauty was not 
the most salient point about the Fabians, as a rule.
</p>
<p> 
“It is his voice that has made him so popular,” said Constance. “I only hope he will not sing it 
all away: he is so very young to be singing so much.”
</p>
<p> 
Then they went off into talk about other matters; Constance touched gently upon the subject of 
her sister’s marriage; and presently it was time for a return to St. George’s Terrace, whither 
she invited the two young men to luncheon.
</p>
<p>
Rosy said to herself that she was quite weary with her clever acting, and that she had done 
enough to mislead Fritz’s brother as to the state of her affections; but somehow she felt 
no inclination to relax in her work of captivating Donald. She knew perhaps that she had won 
his heart, and nothing she could do now would have power to displace her image from his breast; 
but there was a pleasure in permitting his worship different to any she had yet known, and she 
continued to talk to him almost exclusively throughout luncheon, whilst the attention of Lady 
Maud and Constance was occupied with their other guest, and up to the moment of the young 
men’s departure to meet the Havenport doctor and the three-o’clock train.
</p>
<p>
It so chanced that not one word concerning Fritz was mentioned, either by his brother or 
either of the others; and Rosy could not make it out. Perhaps if she knew that Dick Fabian 
had never heard of her, or of Mrs. Halliday’s Saturday evenings specially, she would have 
felt even more vexed and hurt than she did whilst still imagining that the reticence on 
the part of Dick Fabian was caused by his just anger at seeing his handsome brother so soon 
cut out by another man.
</p>
<p> 
Fritz was not much given to talking of his own concerns, except to Constance; and not even 
to Donald had he confided the fact that he had fallen in love very soon after his arrival 
in London; much less had he chosen to tell Dick of the circumstance, for that young man, 
having suffered from the charms of one lovely girl himself, was the very last person in 
whom one still in hope as to the result of his love story, would find a sympathetic confidant.

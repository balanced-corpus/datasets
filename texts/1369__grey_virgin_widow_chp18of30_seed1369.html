“Love is like honestly, much talked of, and little understood.”

<p>
A fortnight has elapsed subsequent to the close of the last chapter, during which I spent a most delightful time at Carthewin
Castle, riding, driving, shooting, fishing, and boating on the lake. I was frequently accompanied in these pastimes by Gertrude
and Mr Rodway, but very rarely had I an opportunity of conversing with Nora, except at meal hours. She spent most of her time
in her boudoir, or the “snuggery,” which latter place, as before stated, was inaccessible to any person other than the family
and and after the visitors had departed on their respective rounds of morning pleasure, our heroine usually adjourned to the
library, sometimes appeared at luncheon, and not unfrequently asking to be excused from the usual unconventional eight o’clock
dinner, on the plea of some slight indisposition. All these little manœuvres pointed to the fact of her having a very decided
disinclination (the outcome of timidness) to confer with me on the painful subject which occasioned my visit to Carthewin Castle.
Day after day passed without the slightest sign of Mrs Snowdon’s inviting me to fulfil the object of my mission. It seemed that
everyone was glad to keep the door closed, as it were, against an atmosphere that would naturally, when introduced, damp the
spirits of those who had been so energetically striving to”cast dull care away; “but, day by day, I was keen enough to observe
that Nora was becoming more and more thoughtful, and tremulous in her voice, when holding a conversation with me; probably
fearing every moment that I would launch out, and in one fell swoop clear the load that was accumulating within her breast, and
thus expose her highly-sensitive nerves to a galvanic shock that, sooner or later, must be applied to them. It made my heart ache
to see that pale face sometimes resting on her white thin hand, her eyes staring into vacancy, and in deep meditation; at other
times she would glide in and out of the conservatory with assumed gaiety, and with a demeanour which I knew to be unreal—dodging
all the guests of the house, avoiding, in every possible way, a conversation, except of a most promiscuous kind. Even poor
Leonard gravely shook his head, and the old man’s eyes filled with tears whenever he spoke of her to me; on one occasion saying,
“Lord love her dear heart, Major; I wish I was a hangel in heaven, instead of a worn-out old butler, that I may come down and
minister unto her. Try your hand, Major, try your hand; take her out and about, and see what you can make of her. Lord love her!
I know she watches you from every window in the Castle like a cat would a mouse—bless her heart—but don’t say I said so.”
</p>
<p>
In some of those endlessly pleasant gravel walks that interlaced the shrubbery, where Nora delighted, unobserved, to wander alone
with a book, I sometimes ran up against her whilst I was indulging in my vesper cigar, and on those occasions, if I deciphered
her countenance correctly, it was suggestive of a mixture of pleasure and grief, with sweet touches of sadness now and then
portrayed in her demeanour. I always found her surpassing dexterous in the knowledge of most things, and with a mind alive to
all the beauties of nature and art. She was passionately fond of flowers, and never seemed tired of dilating on horticultural
development, and rarely better pleased than when she was manipulating, from their earliest growth, the choice plants which the
head gardener entrusted her with. I discovered another most striking trait in her character. It was that of the most profound
reverence and love, which she inwardly felt and outwardly exhibited, towards aged persons and others who were oppressed or in
trouble, not only within her own social circle, but amongst the poor of the parish and adjacent hamlets. A blush would
sometimes creep over her pale face when any subject was touched upon where strict honour or integrity was wanting, then her
large frank eyes flashed unmistakable signs of tumult within; on the other hand, when a good and gracious act, executed by one
individual towards another at the right moment, and with the purest and best intentions, came to her knowledge, she was quick
to appreciate its worth, and treasure up next her heart those grains of gold! Many, many times since I penned these lines have
I looked back with loving remembrance to those early days when Providence (not chance) brought me face to face, heart to heart,
and soul to soul with that pure, sweet life, which shone like a lighthouse on all around her. In the words of a great novelist,
I say,—
</p>
<div>

<p>
“Blessed he, who has the love of a good woman.”

<p>
But I am digressing, and must take my reader with me over other exciting scenes, and, perhaps, the most momentous and thrilling
incident of my life, in connection with my visit to Carthewin Castle; but it is a task not easily accomplished, and I have more
than once laid down my pen, only to take it again with increased earnestness and many doubts, fearing that on my way I may fall
short in portraying with due force and correctness the events of this ever memorable red-letter day—events that demand much
from me, as one of the graceful tributes I can offer our heroine; and fearing, too, that in recalling those bright and happy
reminiscences, I may sail a little closely to the danger signal of egotism, and in my enthusiasm exceed somewhat the bounds of
moderation; but as facts and fiction are interwoven herein, and intimately bound up together, I should be wanting in love and
gratitude if I did not produce at least one faithful portrait of the estimable lady with whom I have happily become associated;
but “he that praises himself, is a debtor to all others.”
</p>
<p>
It was on a dull autumnal afternoon in the beginning of September, and the first few days in the “open,” that Mr Townsend,
Mr Rodway, and myself were seated under one of the old oaks—those giant sons of the forest—that abound on the fringe of
Carthewin coverts. We had been partridge shooting the whole of the morning, tramping along up to our knees in mangol, turnip,
gorse, and stubble, and the bags that were thrown into the cart which brought up the lunch-basket from the “Townsend Arms” in
the village, spoke their own language as to a faithful record of the leash of guns that were out that morning. Few better shots
could be found in the county than Mr Townsend and Mr Rodway, particularly the latter, who, with two exceptions, killed right
and left all day. How I envied him! notably when this deponent fired two barrels at an easy bird, and had the mortification of
seeing Cuthbert drop it with his choke and wire cartridge at fifty yards!—how many times he did this before lunch time, I am
ashamed to admit. Men not unfrequently step into a turnip field or cover on wonderfully good terms with themselves, resolute in
their determination to render a good account of their bag at the close of the day; they grasp their gun with unusual firmness,
compress their lips, become silent, actually in earnest, and looking and feeling like business “all over!” They try to quiet
their nerves, but that is just the mistake, for it is the very rock on which sportsmen are usually wrecked; the nerves decline
to be subdued, hence the many misses. The little boy who has been brought up with the gun in his hand, has no nerves, so to
speak; he is always as cool as a trout, and, if he continue his shooting into manhood, he can invariably hold his own against
all comers, and is absolutely reliable in all places, lights, wind, and weather. Such, however, is the writer’s experience. How
thoroughly one enjoys the refreshing hour from one to two under a lee hedge, in the middle of a crisp September day, with a
well-stocked lunch-basket and the best of appetites, after a good four hours’ spin in the “open,” surrounded by a leash of
dogs, staring at you with their limpid eyes, in eager anticipation of participating in the small scraps that may fall from the
rich man’s table; if they intrude their noses a little too near the viands, and are severely rebuked by a vicious kick, how
gentle and loving they are! Speak but kindly to them, then note the intelligent tear glistening in their eyes, and the
unbounded joy they manifest by the wag of their tail. Noble, unselfish, forbearing animals! what sound, practical lessons they
teach us! The writer has had manifold opportunities of studying, and has experienced infinite pleasure in the companionship of
many intelligent dogs; and, if space would only permit, I could record numerous instances of the remarkable sagacity exhibited
by my old and much-beloved retriever “Captain;” but as such Would be out of place in this narrative, I will simply offer this
passing tribute to the memory of the grand old animal that followed me with his nose close to my heel, through many long
seasons, sometimes under trying circumstances, endless disappointments, and (when rations were short) with, alas! an empty
stomach! Yet how uncomplaining! how easily satisfied! Thrash him for disobedience, thump him for inattention, and in a moment
after, though smarting with pain, he licks the very hand that chastised him! But “Captain,” my trusted friend, my unselfish
companion in long travel, at home and abroad, has passed away, and at the Woodlands, beneath a cedar of Lebanon whose large
flat boughs have ofttimes screened us both from the pelting rain and the scorching sun, and where we have spent many happy
moments, and had many a jolly meal together, rest the remains of the grand old and faithful dog—once a host in himself!
</p>
<p>
“Why, Major Grey,” said Mr Townsend, making a vigorous lounge with his fork into the lunch-basket, and empaling upon it the
wing of a fowl, “you are not in your usual good form to-day; using a sporting phrase—not ‘fit.’”
</p>
<p>
The setter Ranger looked me full in the face, and said, as it were,—”Them be my sentiments.” The brute had experienced many
disappointments under my gun during the day, and don’t they enjoy a good kill!
</p>
<p>
“It does happen sometimes, Mr Townsend,” I replied; “I cannot account for it, it is often a puzzle to me: kill all one day,
miss all next.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you are in love?” said Rodway, fixing his restless keen eyes upon me inquiringly.
</p>
<P>
“Yes; I am in love.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! just so; that accounts for the milk in the cocoa-nuts, as the saying is. I thought so. Those sort of things, don’t you
know, Grey, play the bear with a fellow sometimes, particularly if it isn’t re-ci-pro-cal” (he pronounced it such), “and no
error—ha! ha! ha!”
</p>
<p>
“You appear brimful of experience in these matters,” I responded, with assumed gaiety.
</p>
<p>
“One can’t shoot well, don’t you know, in two directions at the same time, Major Grey, Drop your love, and you drop your
birds—ha! ha! ha!”
</p>
<p>
The leash of dogs were unanimous in their approval of those remarks, judging by the oscillation of their tails, as they each
sat up on their antipodes, hungry spectators. If dogs can’t talk, they are mighty listeners!
</p>
<p>
“Let me see,” went on Cuthbert, “what is it that Mr Shakespeare said,—
</p>

<div>
<!-- small text, center justified -->
<p>
‘Come, love and health to all!<br>
Then I’ll sit down; give me some wine, fill full.’”
</p>
</div>

<!-- no indent on this paragraph, implying it is still the same paragraph -->
<p>
at the same time tossing off a tumbler of old brown brandy, be it said, with little water.
</p>
<p>
“Cuthbert, my boy,” said Mr Townsend, “why don’t you stick to the pale ale. By Jove! sir, if you polish off sundry potations
of spirituous liquor like that, I won’t answer for the consequences when we resume work, though I don’t think I shall shoot
much more to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“Never fear, uncle; you know I am a cautious bird.”
</p>
<p>
“If you will allow me, master, to make so bold,” said the head keeper, “all I got to say is, if some of them birds were a little
more cautiouser, it would be better for their internals,—leastways, when Mr Cuthbert be looking over his barrels.”
</p>
<p>
“Look here, muzzle-loader,” said Rodway, “I know you are the hardest nut to crack in this county, and a hard hitter, and no error;
notwithstanding, I will give you six pigeons out of twenty, thirty yards rise, and shoot you for ten of my current coins of
the realm, called sovereigns, against your liver-and-white spaniel ‘Turn-over.’”
</p>
<p>
“Turn-over,” who was looking on, didn’t seem to see it: but perhaps he said within himself,—”If you don’t know, master, when
you have a good servant, I know when I have a good master.”
</p>
<p>
“Not if I know it, Mr Cuthbert,” said keeper. “Excuse me making so bold, but ‘taint quite level work; three eyes to two,
don’t ‘e see.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, to tell you the plain truth, master, that bit o’ round glass which you sticks up, is a hawful punisher;—no getting up
aside o’ that lot—anyhow, you must get up pretty early, and have your breakfast over-night, to match it; but, Mr Cuthbert, if
you will drop tellscope, or mikescope, magnifier, or whatever they calls it, I’m your man any day; that it, with master’s
permission.”
</p>
<p>
“Turn-over” made tracks, disgusted!
</p>
<p>
“I’ll have no betting on my estate,” said Mr Townsend, a little warmly. “Don’t you risk your spaniel, Drogget; ten pounds
is nothing to my nephew, and as to your dog ‘Turn-over,’ Mr Rodway breaks the tenth commandment every time he goes out with him.”
</p>
<p>
After luncheon, Rodway lighted a cigar, and, shouldering his gun, strolled away in the woods with his valet in deep conversation,
and I was left alone with Mr Townsend, who was evidently in deep thought, as, on more than one occasion, he appeared a little
absent whenever I addressed him.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Major Grey,” at last ventured the lord of the soil, “has Nora ‘opened up’ in any way to you on matters connected with
her late husband?” at the same time fixing his penetrating eyes upon me.
</p>
<p>
“Not one syllable, sir,” I replied, pulling vigorously at my meerschaum, and sending a few circles of smoke into the air.
</p>
<p>
“Really! how odd! However,” went on Mr Towndend, after a short pause, “she purposes having a conversation with you to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“To-day!” I repeated, a little nervously.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Before I left home this morning, Nora came to my dressing-room, and requested me to intimate to you, should a
favourable opportunity occur, that she wished to have a strictly confidential interview at six o’clock, in the oak room;
that is, if it meet with your pleasure.”
</p>
<p>
“No pleasure, sir, can be so great to me as that which I shall derive in being of service to Mrs Snowdon or her august
father.”
</p>
<p>
Mr Townsend bent his head approvingly, saying,—
</p>
<p>
“I most heartily reciprocate those kindly-expressed sentiments, Major Grey; albeit am very greatly afraid that your visit at
the Castle on this special occasion is one which will not be productive of much pleasure to you.”
</p>
<p>
“You would not say so, sir, if you but knew how supremely happy I have been during my sojourn here. Your unbounded hospitality,
and the many graceful acts of kindness accorded me by Mrs Townsend and your good daughters, have filled me with emotion; indeed
they are far more than I deserve, or ever drempt of.”
</p>
<p>
Again Mr Townsend gave me a searching look. I felt sure there was much in the background of his mind, as he kept twisting
about his gold eyeglasses, and watching my countenance with marked vigilance; but I was armed, as Shakespeare has it, “So
strong with honesty,” that I could bear the full force of his scrutiny.
</p>
<p>
There was a long pause. All was silent, except the rustling of the oak and beech leaves, the twitter of some sparrows, and
the flight of the wood-pigeon homeward bound;—that mysterious lull in the conversation which at times and under certain
conditions is difficult to wrestle with; so much so, that words obstinately stick in one’s throat.
</p>
<p>
“Ah! me! what a world this is,” at last ventured Mr Townsend, in a musing and preoccupied way.
</p>
<p>
“Not a bad world, sir,” I responded, “provided the people in it would only act their parts conscientiously, and pull an
honest oar in the struggle of life; in which case, how happy and contented we should then be.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Major Grey, we must all pull in the same direction, or else no good result will follow: one rusty nail in the mill
will destroy and throw out of gear the whole machinery, don’t you know; and now,”went on Mr Townsend, “I want to talk to
you most seriously about my daughter.”
</p>
<p>
“With whom I shall have the pleasure of an interview at six o’clock,” I remarked.
</p>
<p>
“Precisely; albeit what you call pleasure would to me be intense pain. Of the latter, Heaven knows, I have had enough
lately. But looking at things philosophically; believing, as I do, that all things which happen are for the best; and knowing
that there is a silver lining to every cloud, I have little doubt but I shall eventually breathe in a very different
atmosphere to that which I am now existing in.”
</p>
<p>
I thought Mr Townsend said this in a somewhat piteous voice, so I replied,—
</p>
<p>
“Men, sir, not unfrequently fancy they see the future through a dark horoscope, and—”
</p>
<p>
“But to business,” interrupted Mr Townsend. “Excuse my using the term, Major Grey, and suppose we saunter together to yonder
lonely nook in the glen, where we need not speak beneath the breath.”
</p>
<p>
“With pleasure,” I said.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, my friend, it is all pleasure with you,” murmured Mr Townsend.
</p>
<p>
“Not at all, sir, every heart knoweth its own bitterness, its own sadness; and at no period of my life have I ever felt
intoxicated with pleasure.”
</p>
<p>
“All to come, my young friend, all to come,” replied Mr Townsend, with a warm expression of countenance, and a gentle squeeze
of the right arm, as he interlaced his in mine, and we picked our way through the rugged defile that led to the glen.
</p>
<p>
“It was here in this secluded spot,” said Mr Townsend, with tears in his eyes, “that my ever-lamented and much-beloved wife,
the fond mother of my Nora, wandered so much alone. Every nook and tree, could they but speak, would tell long tales of the
joyous moments she spent amidst this dense foliage. Truly she was an ornament to society, a bright shining star, a woman of
undeviating rectitude, mild benevolence, and keen sense of duty and morality.”
</p>
<p>
“I have heard my good mother often speak of the late Mrs Townsend,” I replied. “She was intimately acquainted with my aunt
in early days, with whom she spent some time at Derwentwater, near Windermere, and from whom she received many graceful acts
of kindness.”
</p>
<p>
“Her name?” asked Mr Townsend, again fixing his keen eyes upon me.
</p>
<p>
“Podmore,—daughter of Anthony Podmore, of Brook Castle. My mother was a Miss Podmore.”
</p>
<p>
“What!” exclaimed Mr Townsend vehemently, “your mother a Miss Podmore! you don’t speak it!”
</p>
<p>
“Did you know my aunt, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“Know her! Next to my lamented wife, I knew no one more gentle, more amiable, more lovable, and chaste than Clara Podmore. I
could a tale unfold—a long, sweet, sad tale—that I never grow tired of telling, so full of the happiest recollections of
my college life. And you her nephew!—your mother her sister!—you, now standing before me in this glen, speaking of Clara
Podmore, poor little bright-eyed Clara Podmore, now a bright speck a long long way up! Yes, truly, she loved as Rachel loved
Jacob. Well, well—but more anon. Some day, perhaps, yes, some day, Grey, we may resume this happy yet sad subject. And now
to the main point, for I have lamentably digressed.”
</p>
<p>
“The digression, sir, has interested me immensely; and I am rejoiced to know that at least one member of my family has been
held in high esteem by a gentleman whose friendship I so much value.”
</p>
<p>
“And which cannot be forfeited, so long as you continue in the straight course and lead the exemplary life that I know is
yours,” responded Mr Townsend.
</p>
<p>
“You think too well of me, sir; I have not yet earned that golden opinion, therefore I have no title to it.”
</p>
<p>
At that moment Nora entered my thoughts. “It is now three o’clock,” said Mr Townsend, “and you are to see my daughter at
six. I am uncommonly anxious about her, and for the life of me I cannot shake off the depression that weighs so heavily upon
my poor child. She is simply going to a shadow, and if a change do not soon take place, I fear God will think fit, in His
infinite goodness, to snatch away my precious ewe lamb.”
</p>
<P>
I replied, in the words of the poet,—
</p>
<p>
“Earth hath no sorrows that Heaven cannot heal;” also, “God can dry the mourner’s tears.”
</p>
<p>
“True that,” responded Mr Townsend, “but my child has had a crushing blow, Grey, and I wish to impress upon you how
absolutely essential it is to keep nothing from her appertaining to her late husband. Nora is a curious compound, a sweet
disposition, highly sensitive, with noble feelings; I have the measure of her heart to a nicety. With well-directed tact
and kindly feeling, with which I know your nature is charged, I wish you to go to her rescue; you, and you alone, have the
king key that will unlock the well of tears that is now inwardly killing her. Yes, for months past her eyes have been dry as
hay. It will be false delicacy to hide from her the thrilling scene that closed the chapter of poor Snowdon’s career.
I wish you to dilate on his life as you found it; to expatiate on his expiring moments, with all its dismal surroundings,
as impressed at the time upon you. Conceal nothing; give it all the force and expression at your command; add not one
iota to the melancholy scene with which you are familiar; neither give it the slightest colouring, nor keep back a wish, a
message, nor an injunction of her departed hero, however harrowing it may apparently be to her feelings, or painful to
yourself, else you will do more harm than good. I am satisfied that behind those poor sunken eyes of my child there is a
flood of scorching tears,—they must be relieved at all cost, at all risk; and if you fail in the attempt, Lord help her!
Her mind will, I fear, become a blank,—a sweet thing of the past; and I—I—no matter what!” and the massive head of that
handsome man fell buried in his hands.
</p>
<p>
Strong as my frame was, and accustomed to thrilling scenes, yet the paternal aflection portrayed in this splendid fellow
absolutely unnerved me, so much so, I could scarcely utter a word; albeit I pulled myself together, resolutely saying,—
</p>
<p>
“I will not add, sir, one sentence that may barrow up your feelings. I take the instructions of my general, so to speak,
and, like a good soldier, will carry out your wishes. The trial to me will be great, yet greater to your daughter. If I
fail in the attempt you will, at least, know that I have religiously performed my duty. I have to play in this sad business
a part which unlooked-for circumstances have placed me in, and which may bear, as I proceed, the stamp of egotism. I have
also to ingratiate myself with materials at my command in the probable favour of your daughter. Nevertheless, I will advance
to acquire the end you desire; but never shall it be recorded that Oliver Grey made capital out of those materials. More, sir,
I cannot say; but ere I move one step, it is due to my honour, and it is due to the absolute confidence you have reposed in
me, to speak out plainly and without reserve.”
</p>
<p>
Mr Townsend squeezed my hand affectionately, and in a low tone said,—
</p>
<p>
“I place, my good fellow, the most implicit confidence in you. May God give you strength to go through the work. Mrs
Townsend and Cuthbert are going to drive over and dine with me at the abbey, as I have to meet my steward there. You, Nora,
and Gertrude will have your quiet little dinner together after concluding your tête-à-tête. Not one word, please, to anyone,
respecting this interview.”
</p>
<p>
“Most certainly not,” I replied.
</p>
<p>
At this moment Rodway, his valet Martineaux, and one keeper appeared in the distance; I therefore lifted my hat to Mr Townsend,
shouldered my gun, and made some rapid strides over the golden gorse, and on through the “higher starts” farm towards
Carthewin Castle.
</p>
<p>
I felt greatly perplexed, on reviewing the conversation which I had just had with Mr Townsend. There was, I knew, a
tenderness and mystery unfathomable in Nora. In a few short hours I should, no doubt, be in possession of her inmost
thoughts and wishes.
</p>
<p>
“How eminently handsome she looked last night,” I soliloquised. “Notwithstanding the attention I paid her, there was a
considerable stand-offishness in her demeanour,—a distant <em>hauteur,</em>—and very imperturbable. Dear Nora, the ideal
woman I have so long pictured! you little know the galvanic thrills that the sight of your picture and its original have
created in my breast; added to which, the memory of past days,—of one whose name you bear,” and thus I dreamily dwelt, as
I tramped along over arable, grass, stubble, and heather-covered knolls, blowing away at my meerschaum, full of anxious
thoughts for the coming interview.
</p>
<p>
The sickle-shaped moon, with her pale crescent, was now in view in the steel-grey sky. The cows came lowing from the windmill
meadow to the home farm. I paused at the head of the broad lake. It was an enchanting spot, full of poetry. The lofty trees
throwing their gaunt shadows athwart the greensward beneath. The monotonous ripple of the numerous streamlets, as they
meandered their way down the precipitate slopes of the sidelands, could be distinctly heard; and I heard, too, the Castle
clock strike sweetly in the silent air, as I turned towards the courtyard and the grand old tower that stood grim in the
western sky.
</p>
<p>
Having deposited my breechloader in the gun-room, and exchanged my shooting-boots (to which there was attached at least
four pounds of arable soil), adjusted a clean pair of gaiters, and had a good pull at my brandy-flask by way of a fortifier,
I strolled leisurely along the broad terrace to the east end of the castle, on which side I could take a passing glance at
the oak room, in the hope of seeing Nora. I paced up and down with a well-measured military tread, and took a promiscuous
look through the casement, but Nora was not to be seen. I then entered the Castle, and met Leonard in the hall.
</p>
<p>
“I hope you have had good sport, Major?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, thank you, Leonard; excellent.”
</p>
<p>
“Birds are very shy, sir, so they tell me.”
</p>
<P>
“Very.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr Cuthbert is a ‘customer,’ isn’t he, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“A what, Leonard?”
</p>
<p>
“A ‘dead nail’ I mean, Major.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, a very remarkable shot, Leonard.”
</p>
<p>
“Not over careful about handling his gun and covering his neighbour, so they say.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed! I did not observe it.”
</p>
<p>
“What everybody says, I s’pose must be true,” replied Leonard, tugging away at the corners of his waistcoat nervously.
</p>
<p>
It occurred to me that the old man ventured these remarks in a very mysterious manner: the curl of his lip and the
expression of his countenance were altogether suggestive.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs Snowdon in, Leonard?” I asked, in a casual way, at the same time sipping a very hot cup of tea that the footman had
served me with in the spacious hall, where I was ensconced in a luxurious arm-chair before a blazing logwood fire that
crackled fiercely, aud surrounded by many lay figures in armour clad.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Nora” (the old man found it difficult to call her anything else), “sent for me a half an hour since, to ask if you
had returned, sir; and when I told her you hadn’t, Lord love her heart! she heaved up such a sigh, and said I was to let
her know the moment you arrived, as she had an appointment with you in the oak room on business matters of importance, and
on no account was I to have you disturbed. Lord love her! trust me for that.”
</p>
<p>
“I am very much at Mrs Snowdon’s service, Leonard, if it be agreeable for her to see me now.”
</p>
<p>
“Agreeable, Major!” replied Leonard, giving another tug at his waistcoat. “Bless her soul,” he continued, in a whisper, “I
can read my dear little mistress, my rosebud, as I call her from her cradle, like a book with the largest type. She has
been dying this fortnight to have somethink over with you; she has been a fretting and fuming all about the Castle, crazed
like. More than once I tried to pacify her, for, do you know, Major, she will generally listen to me; but lately she has
snapped my old head off the moment I opened my mouth. Love her tender heart! if she only knew what restless nights I have
had about her. Often do I crawl from my warm bed in the small hours, regardless of the rheumatics, and creep down the main
staircase to her room door, and listen to hear if things are all right; for I have lately had some hawful dreams about her,
and I start up, and I can’t for the life of me get a wink of sleep till I have satisfied myself nothing has gone wrong. Love
her heart! if anything happened to that child, good-bye to Leonard!”
</p>
<p>
“You are a faithful servant,” I replied sympathetically, “and you will have your reward.”
</p>
<p>
“Reward, Major, I want no reward, but a continuation of that regard she bears old Leonard. I’ve fed on it for years
past,—yes, from her very cradle upwards; take it away, and I shall starve to death, that’s what I should.”
</p>
<p>
“Cheer up, my good man, all will go well; time works wonders; Mrs Snowdon will doubtless be herself again soon.”

“Time must be pretty quick about it then Major, for there aint much left of her. I watch her at meal times, and she picks
and picks over her food, and hides all the meat, so cute like, under her vegetables, and passes all the best little
tit-bits I hand her—there. She don’t eat enough to keep a mouse alive. I’ve got my eye on her plate, when she little
thinks I am watching her; it makes me that sad and nervous, I am ready to choke: nobody else seems to notice it—not nobody.
I did say to missis the other morning, ‘Please ma’m, I hope no offence, but poor missy don’t eat not no food,’ and she
flared up, and said,—’Who’s poor missy?’ and when I told her—my crickey! didn’t she warm me up a ‘few;’ didn’t she, that’s
all! She told me to keep my place, and dared me ever to address her again on the subject. She did say in her flare
up,—”Tis nothing but Mrs Snowdon’s wretched temper!’ Temper, Major! why, missy’s got the temper of a lovely white
hangel—and a hangel she is, love her heart! But, hark! there’s her bell, by Jove!—back in a minute, Major,” and the good
old man bustled through the corridor as though he owned but twenty summers. He returned in a few minutes, saying,—”Missy knows
you have returned, and she wishes to see you at once. For pity’s sake, Major, don’t say a word about what I told you.”

“Not for the universe, Leonard.”

I was just leaving the hall, when the poor fellow gently took ahold of my arm, and, in soft accents, said,—
</p>
<p>
“I am an old man, Major, with more than one foot in the gave. I have dangled that blessed child, like a tender mother, on
my knee. I know that you will forgive me; but you can save her, you can save her! For God’s sake don’t be shy; out with
it like a man, like a bold brave soldier, that you are. No one living but myself knows what is in dear missy’s mind. The
ball. Major, is rolling at your feet, which Mr Cuthbert is moving heaven and earth to pick up. Curse him! God forgive me
for saying so.”
</p>
<p>
I could not trust myself to reply, but as I hastened to the oak room, I pressed the faithful old man’s hand so
affectionately, that I made him wince. It was an earnest of my intention to carry out his wishes—which, to tell the reader
the truth, were identical with my own.

<meta charset="utf-8">
<!--CHAPTER 38.<br>—THE VISION.-->
<p>So happy were Arthur and Jenny in each other’s society at Daneton, that they grudged even so slight an intrusion on it as another lodger under the same roof; and when Mrs. Weeks suggested the possibility of the occurrence of such an event, Arthur opposed the idea with vigour.</p>
<p>“I would rather pay the extra rent, Mrs. Weeks,” said he, “and thereby secure his room instead of his company.”</p>
<p>“But it is not a <i>he</i> at all, sir,” remonstrated Mrs. Weeks; “it is only an invalid lady; and she has been recommended here by Dr. Skewbald, the same gentleman as has found ‘ozone’ or whatever it is, at Daneton, and is the making of the place.”</p>
<p>” I know all that, my good woman: he recommended <i>us</i> — but not to come to the Dormers in particular.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir; but this is different. Mrs. Newton, for that is her name, writes to say, or rather her maid writes for her, that a roomy house close by the sea is indispensable to her health, and that the doctor mentioned the Dormers, knowing, I suppose, that it had given yourselves satisfaction; and as for the poor lady, sir, you will never know she has come; for she will live in the next house, as it used to be, quite apart, and you need never so much as set eyes upon her.”</p>
<p>Thus urged, Arthur gave a reluctant assent to the arrangement; and in due time Mrs. Newton arrived — an elderly lady, much muffled up, and apparently without the free use of her limbs, for she was carried out of the fly into her lodgings. Mrs. Weeks, however, was as good as her word, for if the Tyndalls did “set eyes” upon the new lodger, that was as much as they did. They saw her from the garden, sitting with her knitting-needles at her little window that fronted the sea; and they saw her twice or thrice in her wheelchair on the sands; and that was all. She kept to her old wing of the old house, and in no respect interfered with them.</p>
<p>On the twelfth day of their residence at Daneton, a telegram arrived from Adair requesting Arthur’s immediate presence in London on important business. This summons, so unexpected, and so vague in terms, annoyed the husband, and alarmed the wife. Arthur was extremely averse to leave Jenny alone at Daneton, and yet this reticence, so uncharacteristic of his friend, as to the nature of the emergency, seemed to heighten the necessity for his departure. Jenny was once more filled with terrors in connection with their unknown enemy.Something must surely have again arisen from that base source to implicate her husband, and that so gravely that its nature could not be even hinted at. She besought him to let her accompany him; but he would not hear of that — the double journey involved hundreds of miles, and she was by no means fit for such travel; he promised to return, however, without fail on the ensuing day. Accordingly she saw him off by the morning train, and returned home dejected in spirits and full of forebodings. She had never before been separated from her husband even for a day, and in her forlorn and solitary state, the Dormers struck her, for the first time, as being a desolate and cheerless place. As she passed through the little market-place, she had noticed that the drum was up, a signal that bad weather might be expected, and the wind was blowing as if for storm. Still, anything seemed better than the gloom and solitude of the deserted house, deprived of its home spirit, and after a fruitless attempt to occupy her mind with reading, she wrapped herself up warmly and went out. For a time she walked up and down the little garden under such shelter as the low sea-wall afforded; but — what had never happened before, and which shewed how her nerves had suffered from the event of the day — the supervision of harmless Mrs. Newton, who sat at her usual post, knitting-needle in hand, annoyed her. Whether the poor lady was really looking at her or not, could not be known, since she always had a pair of blue spectacles on her nose; but the idea of such espionage was now become unpleasant, and indeed unbearable. That hateful Mrs. Montague, too, had been described as wearing the same appendages, and even so slight a coincidence as this was not without its effect upon poor Jenny. She left the garden, therefore, and took a long walk beside the angry sea. The whirling sand, the flying foam, were welcome to her: in the war of wind and wave, and in watching the fishing-boats, as one after another they flew for refuge into the little harbour, she forgot for a time the anxieties that consumed her. Fatigued, but yet refreshed, she came back to her mid-day meal, with unexpected appetite; which pleased her, because Arthur had charged her: “For my sake, do feed up, Jenny, while I am away.” Like most husbands, he judged of his wife’s well-being by the amount of fish and flesh that she consumed, which, under the present circumstances, was rather a fallacious test.</p>
<p>By the afternoon post came a second surprise in the shape of a letter from Blanche Tyndall, inclosing another from her husband. “What it is about,” wrote she, “I have no idea; but he sealed it before intrusting it to my hands, which I consider mean.”</p>
<p>Its contents were concerning the very thing which had been weighing on Jenny’s mind all day.</p>
<p>“I have now found out for certain,” they
ran, “what, for my part, indeed, I never doubted, that the paper purporting to have “been written by the late Mrs. Tyndall must needs be a forgery. The date, you will remember, was December 31, 1860. Well, while pondering over this precious production this morning, and turning it all sorts of ways, literally as well as metaphorically, I happened to hold it up against the light, when this singular fact discovered itself: <i>The watermark of the paper is dated</i> 1862. I went off at once to the makers, whose name I had also become thus possessed of, and they tell me that though it is their custom and that of the trade, to post-date their paper, it is never done to any such extent as this. The statement that has given you such annoyance must indeed have been written at least six months, and probably much more, after the death of the late Mrs. Tyndall. Thus the matter is satisfactorily settled as far as Arthur is concerned; that is, I mean, this deliberate attempt to embitter his existence is not, what some who knew neither him nor the late Mrs. Tyndall might have otherwise thought it, the revenge of a slighted wife, but the act of some infamous forger. Of course, it is unpleasant to feel that one has a secret foe, so audaciously malignant, but let us be content to despise, until the opportunity presents itself to punish him.”</p>
<p>But all this well-meant consolation was thrown away upon Jenny. The discovery itself, indeed, would not have been without its interest, and perhaps its comfort, had it happened at any other time; it was something, as Adair had said, to know for certain that that hateful document was a forgery. But of what nature could the emergency have been that had caused Adair to summon her husband so peremptorily within a few hours of sending this information to herself? It could hardly be in connection with the same subject. He would surely have mentioned something of his intention to telegraph, if, at the time of writing, the idea of such a contingency had occurred to him. Thus, so far from relieving her mind, Adair’s letter filled it with alarms and misgivings, that were none the less painful because they took no certain shape. She would have once more gone forth, in hopes to find some restorative for her spirits, in the keen, fresh air again, but the gale had now risen in great fury. The few persons who were still about, staggered and reeled in the fierce blasts like ships at sea, and while she stood hesitating at the hall door, an old market-woman, just in the act of soliciting her custom in sea-side fashion, was blown down, basket and all — Jenny ran out to help her up, and bade her sit down by the kitchen fire, and have some refreshment; not that the woman needed warmth or food, for she had a shop as well as a stall in the market, and was well to do in the world, but a craving for company had suddenly come upon Jenny, which was altogether new to her. Her visitor seemed to perceive this, for she observed: “I daresay you feel lonesome enough, ma’am, to-day, without your husband?”</p>
<p>News was precious in Daneton, and everybody in it knew, by that time, that Mr. Tyndall had gone by the early train to London.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Jenny, laughing, “that is only natural, is it not?”</p>
<p>“Ay, indeed, ma’am, you may say that,” answered the other, sighing. “But you may thank Heaven that your goodman is not, as mine was (God rest his soul!), a sailor, and away from you at his trade on such a day as this.”</p>
<p>“Did you lose your husband at sea?” asked Jenny tenderly.</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am, I did; years and years ago, when he was no older than Mr. Tyndall, and not so gray-looking; but to this hour I never hear the wind like that but I think I hear him calling for ‘Help, help, help!’ It’s near half a century ago, and yet sometimes the thought comes over me that he may not be dead. Not a plank of his boat ever came ashore to say so. Ah, yes, ma’am, it’s well for you as your goodman is no sailor.”</p>
<p>“Your story is very sad,” said Jenny, pityingly; “but we have most of us our troubles, and terrors, and uncertainties.”</p>
<p>“Ay, ay, I daresay. Gentlefolks is no freer from them than other people. And alone in a house like this, they all seem to come upon you together like, no doubt. Do you ever hear now” — here the old gossip sank her voice to a whisper, so that Mrs. Weeks, moving busily in and out of the kitchen as usual, should not overhear her — “anything at the Dormers as you
shouldn’t hear — voices and noises, and such
like?”</p>
<p>“Why, yes,” said Jenny, smiling. “I hear Mrs. Weeks speaking pretty sharply to her maid at times (which I suppose I am not intended to hear); and also the rats make such a noise at night, that one would sometimes think that a sack of potatoes had been opened and its contents rolled down the stairs.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes; but I don’t mean rats: they do tell some queer stones about the Dormers, though, of course, you must know best, and they may be lies. But I have known parties to take the house for a month certain, and then to leave after the first night or two, and ‘all on account of the noises.’”</p>
<p>“That seems to me very unreasonable” said Jenny, quietly.</p>
<p>“Well, well, that is as it may be; and besides, it is not your wing of the house as, they do say, is most troubled. Now, that Mrs. Newton yonder “—and the widow motioned with her hand to the wall that stood between them and the next house—” she seems to be no more frightened than yourself; and yet there are scores of people in Daneton as would rather sleep on the beach under an old boat than in her lodgings. It was there, as I daresay you’ve heard, that poor mad Miss Waldron — Lor, Mrs. Weeks, how you <i>did</i> make me jump.”</p>
<p>“You had better jump up and go, then, Widow Bunn,” said the keen dry voice of the landlady, who had come in unobserved while the old woman was absorbed in her narrative, “and before you begin to chatter about matters which don’t concern you, and of which you know nothing.”</p>
<p>“Well, the wind do seem to have lulled a bit,” rejoined the widow, as a blast, more violent than any which had preceded it, shook the house to its very foundations; “so I’ll just get home while I can.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Weeks only answered her by a scornful look, that said as plainly as any words: “You do very right not to argue with <i>me</i>” and opened the back-door for her with her own hands.</p>
<p>“That’s one of the rubbishy gossiping women with whom all Daneton is overrun,” observed she to Jenny; “and I only hope I stopped her in time, before she did mischief. She has just been telling you, I’ll go bail for it, that because I can’t get rid of the rats, and the wind blows against my windows, that the Dormers is full of uncanny noises.”</p>
<p>“She did say something of that kind,” said Jenny carelessly; “but I told her that my husband and I had never been incommoded by anything of the sort. — Who was this Miss Waldron that she was going to speak of?”</p>
<p>“My master’s daughter, ma’am,” said the old lady curtly. “She was out of her mind, poor soul (though not more so, perhaps, than they as believes such tales as Widow Bunn tells), and died here, or rather in the next house. That makes the place melancholy to <i>me</i>, who nursed her for many a year, and in whose arms she passed away; but I don’t see why it should affect others. It would be difficult to find an old house, I reckon, in which nobody has ever died.”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Jenny. “I hope, however, no foolish person will ever talk about it to your other lodger, for, being ill and weak, it might have an unpleasant effect upon her.”</p>
<p>“There is no fear of that, ma’am. The poor lady sees nobody to speak to, except her own maid; and, indeed, she has been so ill of late as not to be able to take even her usual half hour’s airing in her Bathchair. But I am much obliged to you, ma’am, all the same: it’s a great comfort to me, I do assure you, to have such a sensible lady and gentleman under my roof as you and Mr. Tyndall; and I shall take it very kind of you, if you would say a word in its favour, when you hear it run down by them fools.”</p>
<p>Jenny gladly promised to do this; and yet she did not feel just then that she altogether deserved Mrs. Weeks’ compliments upon her good sense and courage. When she found herself alone in her own room, with the wind howling and the sea roaring without, and within, the arm-chair vacant of its beloved occupant, the sense of loneliness and desolation recurred to her even more strongly than before. The fire was blazing cheerfully, and the small apartment was well lighted, but nothing could dispel her inward gloom. As the tamarisk bent and swished before the gale, she thought of the drowned sailor of whose fate she had just heard, and every shriek of the wild wind made her start in her chair, as though it had been the maniac cry of the poor girl who had met her end years ago, but a few rooms off. Even the ill reputation of the Dormers struck her with a sense of fear. In a word, her nerves were thoroughly shaken, and her thoughts took colour from whatever was most sombre and morbid in the storehouse of her mind. She sat up, however, reading — if that could be called such which was interrupted by a chill or tremor at every noise without and within — until her usual hour, and then retired to her bedroom. A fire was burning here also; but the apartment looked so cold and cheerless, that she lit not only the candles on her dressing-table, but those on the mantelpiece likewise, till the little room was almost as light as by day. It was one of the chambers, of which, as we have already said, there were several at the Dormers, which had once been of larger size, but was now divided by a partition which did not reach the ceiling. On the other side of the partition, but not directly opening into the bed-chamber, was her husband’s dressing-closet; and beyond that again was the wall of division between the houses. The passage outside the two rooms terminated, in fact, in the door of communication between them, which was always kept locked.</p>
<p>Under other circumstances, the knowledge that she had only to raise her voice to make her husband hear her in the next room, was pleasant and snug enough; but now, when she knew he was not there, the blank space above the wall, with the gloomy stretch of ceiling beyond it, was unpleasant to behold, and only suggestive of vacancy and absence. Most women, perhaps, under such circumstances, would have asked their maid to sleep on the sofa, and keep them company for the night, and Jenny herself was half-disposed to do so; but she was of a proud and independent spirit, and little inclined to make allowance in her own case for a weakness which she would have pardoned, and even sympathised with in that of another. What would Arthur say when he came home on the morrow, and heard that his wife, of whose good sense he had always boasted, had been afraid to pass the night alone! Nevertheless, she did keep her attendant in the room rather longer than usual, upon this or that pretence, and before she left it, put a question as to where the chamber bell rang, which shewed the direction of her thoughts. “I know it can be heard in the daytime,” said she; “but could you hear it, if it was rung at night?”</p>
<p>“I could not fail to hear it, ma’am, since it rings just outside my room, where Mary and I sleep together; for as for sleeping in a house like this, alone, I could never clo it. It’s a good big bell, and if you only jerk it sharp enough, it would be heard all over the house.”</p>
<p>Here she pulled the rope to illustrate her remark, but no sound ensued.</p>
<p>“Well, that <i>is</i> strange, ma’am, for I hitched in the rope this very day myself, by accident, when I was doing the room, and it pealed like a church-bell.” Again she pulled, and again without success.</p>
<p>“Well, perhaps it’s the gale, ma’am, as will let nothing be heard but itself, and yet it seems to stick somehow. I’ll go to the other end and see whether it does ring.”</p>
<p>“It is no matter,” said Jenny, who was beginning to feel considerably ashamed of her own pusillanimity. “The roar of such a wind as this may well drown all other sounds. You can leave me now, for I don’t feel inclined for bed, and shall sit up reading for a little.”</p>
<p>“You are <i>sure</i> you wouldn’t like me to stay <i>with</i> you, ma’am ?” said the good-natured maid. “It may well seem lonesome out at this end of the house, and with such a tempest out of doors—”</p>
<p>“No, no; thank you,” interrupted Jenny hurriedly: “I have got my books, and shall do very well.” She felt quite angry with herself at having called forth such an offer by her show of nervousness.” I shall want nothing more. Good-night.”</p>
<p>The maid left her; and she found herself listening to her footsteps along the echoing passage, and then, long afterwards, to the closing of the distant door. If she heard <i>that</i>, why had she not also heard the bell? An hour passed by. The storm seemed to have spent itself. Like a woman whose passion is almost exhausted, there were still murmurings and mutterings, and now and then a stifled sob close up against the window-pane, but there was now comparative calm. The sea still roared and rolled, but to that she had become as accustomed as is the dweller in a busy thoroughfare to the turmoil of the street. There was nothing without to draw her attention from her book, which was itself an interesting one. And yet she had only read by fits and starts: her ears were alive to the least sound within the house. She had heard the noise which careful Mrs. Weeks had made in raking out the kitchen fire for the night, and the shooting of bolts and locking of doors that had marked her final retirement. The house was at rest so far as its human inhabitants were concerned, and the rats had begun their diversions. Jenny had no “young-lady” abhorrences, and was no more afraid of a rat than she was of a black beetle, but still she would have wished them quieter. What a frightful disturbance, and how unlike any other sort of rioting, do those animals make at dead of night! At one time there was a charge of cavalry through half-a-dozen rooms; at another, a sack, not of potatoes (which was our metaphor by daylight), but of coals, seemed to be rolled upstairs with infinite difficulty, and then, at the highest step, the sack was opened, and the contents let fall from top to bottom. It was enough to account for the noise in fifty haunted houses. Hush! was that a rat in the dressing-room?Something was stirring there, and had seemed to move a chair.</p>
<p>Fully aware of her increasing nervousness, Jenny was resolved not to suffer from what one well acquainted with the human mind has called the worst of nervous terrors, “a noise which the reason cannot account for:” she rose instantly, candle in hand, to investigate it, and laid her hand upon the door. As she did so, she distinctly heard what, had it been possible to be so, she would have set down to the Mutter of a woman’s dress in the passage without. She opened the door wide, and, holding the candle above her head, looked to right and left, but there was nothing to be seen. On the right hand lay, afar off, the room in which her maid slept, and that occupied by honest Mrs. Weeks — in a word, help and company; on the left was a dressing-room, and the party-wall that shut off the other house. She hesitated a moment as to whether she should not even now arouse her attendant, and accept the offer of her companionship for the night, but pride once more came to her assistance. She determined to explore the dressing-room. With a trembling hand she opened the door and threw it back. She scarcely needed her candle to see all within it, for the strong light from her own chamber, coming over the low partition, lit it up brightly. There was the little table with its shaving-glass, the “skimpy” chest of drawers, a heap of clothes lying folded in a chair, and a row of boots. Everything, in short, was in its usual state. What she had heard must have been fancy. Considerably reassured by the result of this examination, and congratulating herself on the effect of her own courage, she was about to return to her own room, when an Impulse seized her to try the door of communication (though she well knew it was always locked) between the two houses of which the Dormers was composed. She did so, and what was her surprise and consternation to find it give to her touch — that it was open!</p>
<p>She closed it mechanically, and, with her fingers on the handle, reflected a moment as collectedly as she could. Who could have unlocked it, and for what purpose? Well, perhaps Mrs. Weeks herself had done so; for had she not mentioned that her invalid lodger was not so well, and might not Mrs. Newton have requested it to be left open, in case she should require assistance in the night? This was possible, of course; and even in that moment of panic Jenny accepted this sensible and matter-of-fact solution of the question; the only evidence that she gave of weakness, of her nerves being utterly shaken and unstrung — as, in fact, they were — was that on returning to her own room, she locked the door. To attempt any longer to read her book, however, she felt would be a mockery; vague terrors were creeping over her, stealthy footfalls and trailing garments were sounding in her ear. She would get into bed and try to sleep. Before doing so, she drew aside the blind and looked forth into the night. To her great satisfaction the moon had risen, and showed itself through the fleecy, flying clouds; the sea was a waste of foam; the very garden glimmered white beneath her. Even when the candles were all put out, it would not be dark at all. She was about to extinguish those upon the table, when once more she heard that noise in the dressing-room which had sounded so like the scrape of a chair. She looked up mechanically to the partition-wall, and on the top of it, with the strong light cast full upon every feature, was a woman’s face — the face of Helen Tyndall, who lay buried in Swansdale churchyard! Jenny gazed at it for an instant with staring, terror-stricken eyes, and then, with one wild cry, that rang through the old house from end to end, fell heavily upon the floor.</p>

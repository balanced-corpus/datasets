<!-- Chapter IX. -->
<!-- Chapter Title: A STRANGE VISITOR -->

<p>Wilton returned to his rooms thoroughly vexed with himself. He had done two things, both of which he had long ago resolved that he would not do. In the first
place, he had accepted a bet; in the second, he had
agreed to go upon a party which would occupy the whole
day, besides costing probably a good deal of money—not
to say that it would be in the teeth of University rules,
and of these he knew it would be most unwise for him
to commit any breach. And what had induced him to
break both these resolutions? Nothing on earth but
this man Bristowe’s insolence. He would have refused
a wager offered him by any one else, and would have
even refused a wager offered by him, had it been proposed in a different manner. He would also have
declined Ashburnham’s invitation, which he might have
done without offence, as it was only a general one. But
he had seen Bristowe’s eye fixed upon him, and knew the satisfaction it would have given him, if he had felt obliged to refuse ; and, sooner than gratify this petty malignity, he had broken his second resolution. Yet all the while, as on the former occasion, he utterly despised the man, and was quite aware that what he might think or say was unworthy his consideration. What a weak fool he felt himself to be—more contemptible than Bristowe himself.</p>

<p>Then the amount of the wager itself, now that his
indignation had cooled down, became a matter of serious
consideration. Ten pounds ; and he really was as likely
as not to lose it, for he now remembered a conversation he had had with his cousin Pilkington one day in the quadrangle, in which the latter had said that his father kept him pretty tight at his desk, and was very unwilling to let him accept invitations to a distance.
It was not unlikely that Bristowe had overheard this—there were many men about at the time—and
if so, that would be one reason for his forcing the wager upon him. Ten pounds ! it would be no joke for him to lose that. It would be a worse business than
that, out of which Wardleigh had extricated him on the
former occasion. That was at the end of his first year,
and he was then comparatively free from debt to Oxford
tradesmen. Unfortunately that was not the case now.
Wilton had lived economically, no doubt—more economically than nineteen undergraduates out of twenty
; but he had not strength of resolution enough to practise on all occasions the rigid self-denial, which alone could keep his expenditure within his income. There had been some debts in every term which he could not quite discharge. What these might now amount to he could not exactly say. Most St. Cuthbert’s men would have regarded them as mere trifles. There was a pound perhaps to the boat-builder, and two pounds to the bookseller, and a good deal more to the tailor and bootmaker, and some odd shillings to the watchmaker, etc., etc. But a debt of even a shilling becomes a burden, if a man has only sixpence wherewith to pay
it.  If, in addition to these, he was called upon to produce ten pounds—produce it immediately, or forfeit his credit—it would be a serious matter indeed. He was inclined, at any risk short of encountering actual insult, to get out of it, if he could. He told the whole matter to his friend Osborne before they began their reading on the following day, and asked his advice as to what he had better do under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” said Osborne, when he had heard
Gerald’s story, “I am heartily sorry for what has happened ; and I can‘t pretend to say but what it’s a
very awkward mess. If it had been anybody but Bristowe, I
should advise you to go straight to him, tell him the plain circumstances, and ask him to let you off the wager.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t do that—not if the alternative were being
sent to gaol,” said Wilton.</p>

<p>“I know you wouldn’t, Gerald,” said Osborne; “and therefore I don’t advise anything of the kind. In fact, I
believe I must say plainly that I don’t think you can get
out of it.”</p>

<p>“ Can’t I offer to pay him a forfeit?” suggested Wilton. “I have got just three guineas and a half in my purse. Mightn’t I offer him them to let me off? ”</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about betting,” said Osborne,
“ but I should think that would be a strange thing to propose. Anyhow, I feel quite certain that he would not agree to it. But look here, Gerald, I think we may manage
this between us, after all. You say you have three
guineas and a half, don’t you? ”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Wilton; “three pounds fourteen is
the exact sum in my purse, and part of that will have to go
to pay my fare to Harchester.”</p>

<p>“I understand that. But I have four pounds by me,
which I have saved this term, and which I can lend you
until you are able to repay me. Besides that, I have
this morning had notice that the Greek Epigram—left,
you know, by Benson for St. Cuthbert’s men—has been
awarded to me. That is five pounds, and will be paid me
in a few days ; so that between us we could raise this ten
pounds, and have nearly three pounds to spare, which
would be quite enough to take us both to our homes.”</p>

<p>“ My dear John,” said Wilton, “you are the very best
fellow in all the world, but I really couldn’t take—”</p>

<p>“ Why not?” said Osborne. “If it were I that wanted it,
you would lend it me fast enough, and I should make no sort of scruple in taking it.”</p>

<p>Wilton grasped his friend’s hand, and the tears came
into his eyes. “I won’t spunge upon you, John, if I can
possibly help it, and there may be no need. But if this
brute should win the wager, sooner than be at his mercy,
I will pick your pocket, monstrous shame as it would be.
However, we’ll say no more about this now. Let’s go on
with the Herodotus.”</p>

<p>They set to work accordingly, and had been engaged
on it about two hours—when there came a somewhat noisy rap at the oak outside.</p>

<p>“Who is that, I wonder?” said Wilton, breaking off at
the point where the venerable father of history relates
how that once upon a time a certain man, who had been
chained tight by the foot, and was unable to release himself from the encumbrance, cut off the foot in question
and ran away—“doing a thing,” as he is wont quaintly
to remark, “ not credible to me, but it may be to some
one else.”</p>

<p>“Never mind who it is,” said Osborne. “We must
finish this chapter. If he chooses to wait till then, well
and good.”</p>

<p>“ Guess he won’t, though,” said Wilton, as there came
another thundering summons. “ I say, Osborne, just
put your eye to that little window above your chair
there. From it you can see the party at the door, without being seen yourself. It may be somebody whom I
must let in—the governor, to wit, come up from
Harchester, or somebody of that sort, though of course
that’s not likely.”</p>

<p>Osborne complied. He mounted on the chair, and
took a look through the window pointed out. “It’s not
your father,” he said, “ but it’s a respectable middle-aged
party, nevertheless. Some one from the country, I should
guess. I should have thought he was a parson, only he
is so queerly dressed: and I half fancy I have seen him
before, though I don’t know where.”</p>

<p>“ A parson, and from the country,” repeated Wilton.
“I don’t know any such. But I suppose I must let him
in, or he will be getting at my scout, who will be sure to
unlock the door.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, if that must be,” said Osborne, “I shall take myself off, and we will finish this chapter separately. If it is a parson, as we suppose, from the country, he’ll be wanting luncheon, and to be shown all over Oxford. So I wish you good-bye.”</p>

<p>He got up, took his books, and departed ; while
Wilton retreated to his bedroom to make some emendations in his toilet, which was not entirely suitable for
receiving an elderly visitor.</p>

<p>While he was engaged in selecting a suitable pair of
trousers, and exchanging his somewhat dilapidated
dressing-gown for the orthodox invisible-green frock coat,
he heard his visitor enter the sitting-room. The latter,
finding nobody to receive him, began to make some
remarks in a tone which was audible in the bedroom.</p>

<p>“Not in, hey?” he exclaimed. “Was in when I
knocked. Man that went out said so. Two staircases
to rooms, I guess—takes me for a dun, and has gone off.
Bad job if this young fool’s in debt. Old Wilton hasn’t
a sixpence to bless himself with. I’ll take a look at his
pictures. Always know a man by his pictures. Hum,
ha—‘ Bolton Abbey in the Olden Time ’—cost three
guineas with the frame, I’ll be bound; and he hasn’t
three shillings to spare.” (In vindication of Wilton, we
must here explain that the picture in question had been a
present from Wardleigh, as well as its companion. Austin,
in his freshman’s term, had bought so many pictures, in
compliance with the invitations of the print-sellers, that
the walls of his room could not hold them ; and he had
consequently made presents of some of them to such
of his friends as would, he thought, appreciate them. This
fact was, however, of course unknown to Gerald’s present visitor, who pursued his animadversions accordingly.)
“What’s on the other side? ‘Meeting of the Duke of
Wellington and Blucher after Waterloo.’ Meeting of rogue
and fool, more likely ! Tradesman, rogue; undergraduate,
fool. That’s the way of it ! Vice-Chancellor’s court and
costs, or else twenty per cent—starve ten years on a curacy to pay it off” ! Should be sorry to see her son come to that. Sweet woman, always admired her !” He took up
a volume or two lying on the table. “ ‘Life of Christ,’ by
David Strauss—simple poison ! Smith’s ‘Bampton
Lectures ’—dreary twaddle! ‘Shelley’s Poems ’—wonder
how much he’ll read of them ! the less the better !
‘ Baehr’s Herodotus,’ ‘ Rennell’s Geography,’ ‘ Liddell
and Scott,’ ‘ Butler’s Analogy.’ Better that. Only a
fool, perhaps—come straight by-and-by. Hope so !”</p>

<p>Here a slight sound caused him to look round, and he
saw the owner of the rooms standing at the door of his
bedroom, listening to these comments on himself, with
an air half of embarrassment, half of amusement.</p>

<p>“ Ha ! good morning, Mr. Wilton,” exclaimed the newcomer, to all appearance not in the slightest degree
discomposed—“ thought you were out—was taking a look
at your pictures and books.” Wilton bowed civilly, and
requested him to be seated. “ Thank you,” said the
other, depositing himself in the undergraduate’s inevitable
easy-chair. “ You don’t know me, and I don’t know
you, but I did know your father and mother. My name
is Fowler, and I am a fellow of this college.”</p>

<p>“Oh !” said Wilton, “I think I have had the pleasure
of seeing you before in Mr. Ingram’s rooms, a little more
than two years ago.”</p>

<p>“Oh, really; have you been at Oxford as long as that?
I only heard of your being here about a fortnight ago.
I suppose your father has forgotten all about me, or he
would have written to me, when you came up as an
undergraduate to my college.”</p>

<p>“I have heard my father speak of you,” said Wilton,
“and I think he would have written, only he didn’t know
your address. He knew you had left Oxford.”</p>

<p>“Ha! and he didn’t know that I was living near
it. Well, that’s likely enough. Well, Mr. Wilton, he was a
kind friend to me when I was a boy at Harchester, and
your mother was a still kinder one. I should like to befriend you for her sake. You are like her, Mr.
Wilton—A good job, too,” he added in a different
tone.</p>

<p>It may here be proper to remark, that no one ever
rightly knew whether Mr. Fowler was aware that his
asides could be heard, or not, by the party to whom
he was speaking. It was a moot point among his
friends, whether he was indifferent to the fact of other
persons overbearing his private thoughts respecting them,
or whether, like Lord Dudley and other eccentric
characters, he was unconsciously thinking aloud. It
is certain that Mr. Fowler never seemed to be in the
smallest degree distressed, when he discovered, as he not
unfrequently did, that his somewhat personal observations had been overheard.</p>

<p>“A good job, too,” he repeated. “Mrs. Wilton was a
handsome woman; old Wilton as ugly as sin! Glad he’s not like his father, anyhow.—Well,” he pursued, again addressing Wilton, “your mother was, as I say, kind to me a long time ago, when I was a young fool, and now it’s my wish to be kind to you if I can, when—”</p>

<p>“When <i>I’m</i> a young fool, I suppose,” added Wilton,
too much amused to be angry.</p>

<p>“Dare say, dare say,” said Mr. Fowler, sedately.
“Undergraduates are apt to be fools, that’s certain.
Anyhow, they are apt to get into scrapes, and older men
may sometimes help to pull them out. Now, if you get
into a scrape, I’ll do what I can for you—that is,” he
added, “if it isn’t anything very snobbish. Must add
that, to prevent mistakes.”</p>

<p>“I am obliged to you,” said Wilton, rather stiffly.
“But I hope I shall not get into any scrape—at all
events, not into a very snobbish one.”</p>

<p>“Hope not, too,” said Mr. Fowler, no more affected
by the snub which the young man intended to give him,
than a rhinoceros or a grisly bear would have been.
“Hope you mayn’t, both for your mother’s sake and
your own. But if you should, here’s my address.” He
handed him his card as he spoke. “And perhaps,” he
added, rising as he spoke, and putting an envelope into
Wilton’s hand, “you won’t refuse to accept this from an
old friend of your mother’s. I always consider myself
as having been greatly in her debt, and I am glad to
have the opportunity of paying some of it. Good
morning,” he added, shaking hands with Wilton, and
hastily taking his departure before the young man had
fully recovered from his surprise. “Pay for the pictures,
anyhow,” he muttered, “and that smart coat, and that
will be something—if they are not paid for already, as I
judge they aren’t.”</p>

<p>He was gone the next moment, leaving Gerald fairly bewildered at the strangeness of the interview,
the termination of which was the strangest part of
it. He opened the envelope, and found, to his astonishment, that the only enclosure was a twenty-pound Bank of England note. He did not for a minute know how to take the thing. He was not a schoolboy, he said to himself, to be tipped after that fashion, and by a man with whom he had never spoken in his life before, and who only claimed to be a friend of his mother’s some twenty years ago. Still there could be no doubt that he meant kindly, and it could hardly be right to reject
genuine kindness. And then—what was a much stronger
argument—twenty pounds was twenty pounds. As the wager
with Bristowe occurred to his recollection, and the debt
of two pounds ten to the bootmaker, and the two pounds
due to the bookseller, and the bill at Hall’s for boats,
and he afraid to think how much at the tailor’s (for the
very coat, among other items, which had provoked Mr.
Fowler’s animadversions), the total amounting, he feared,
to not less than five pounds—he felt his view of Mr.
Fowler’s tip undergo considerable modification. His
first impulse—to put on his cap, and rush after his visitor
with the intention of returning the envelope, accompanying the action with his most dignified thanks —oozed out, like Bob Acres’s courage, at the tips of his fingers. He was disposed rather to view Mr. Fowler as a <i>Deus ex machinâ</i>—the benevolent friend, who in the fifth act comes in to rescue the hero from the despair into which, through the machinations of the villain, he had been plunged. He took out his purse, and deposited the note there in company with the three sovereigns, the half-sovereign, and the silver to which reference has already been made, and which constituted for the present the
whole of Wilton’s ready-money capital. He then put on
his cap and gown, and proceeded to attend the Herodotus
lecture ; where he was fortunate enough not to be set on
in the last chapter, which he had not had time to prepare.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Osborne had returned to his rooms, and finished the Herodotus, at least a quarter of an hour before
the time when the lecture began. It was not worth while
to set about any fresh work ; so, putting on his cap and
gown, he went out to take a mouthful of fresh air in the
college gardens. As he passed the porter’s lodge, a
letter in his mother’s well-known handwriting was put into
his hand. He took it with him to the seat under the
plane trees, and there read it. The reader shall have it <i>in extenso.</i> </p>

<p>“Parleyfield College, May, 1843.<br>

<!-- next paragraph is in all caps and placed to the left of the page in same sized font as body text in the original text. -->

“ MY DEAR JOHN,
</p>

<!-- First line in next paragraph is twice indented from the left but is in the same sized font as body text in the original text. -->

<p>“ Helen and I are much interested in the account you give of yourself. We are very glad you have succeeded in getting the prize for which you had written, and that it will give you money enough, with what you have saved, to pass two months of the vacation in some dry, healthy, quiet place, where you can read undisturbed. Of course we shall miss you, my dearest boy, as you will us ; but I see the wisdom of the step. Parleyfield
is not a healthy place in more senses than one. It is damp and
relaxing. Even Helen and I, who are strong, as the Whartons have always been, are better almost anywhere else. And the endless small worries and jealousies of the college are as bad for the mind, as the enervating climate is for the body. You know how angry some of the ladies were, because you, and your friend Mr. Wilton, would not go to parties continually when you were here—declaring that it was because they were poor, and what bitter things were reported to us on the subject. Now, we have had an <i>esclandre</i> of the opposite kind, superseding the disturbance about the new hymn-book. Captain F——, who has
been passing his leave of absence here with his mother, has
(it is alleged) been paying marked attentions to Miss B——, and has now rejoined his regiment, without making the offer that was expected. Mrs. F—— declares that her son never showed anything more than the barest civilities of life to the young lady—indeed shunned her, so far as it was possible to do so. Mrs. B——, greatly incensed at this, has gone about repeating the complimentary speeches Captain F—— made to her daughter,
and the number of times he danced with her and was her partner at croquet, and how Mrs. A——, and Mrs. C——, and Mrs. D—— all assured her that there could be no possible doubt as to the meaning of his intentions, or, at all events, that there <i>ought</i> to be none. The college is divided into B——ites and F——ites, and the two factions say more bitter things of one another every day, and will continue to do so, I suppose, until some other subject of interest drives Captain F—— and his presumed infidelity from their memories. It is wretched, degrading, unwholesome work. Helen and I persistently avoid the
subject. But I fear we are disliked by both parties, in consequence, instead of by only one.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear John, you are right. I <i>should</i> be glad to get away from Parleyfield; and if you should succeed in the programme you have laid down for yourself, it would be very nice. If you can get a fellowship and a good curacy, we would gladly give up the college here, and come to help you in working your parish. Pupils would not do, on Helen’s account, I suppose. But with the income of the fellowship and the curacy, and what little I have of my own, we should be, comparatively
speaking, quite rich people. And then I suppose in a few more years you would get a college living, and perhaps yourself marry—oh, my dear boy, I must not allow myself to think of such things; but if you knew what you are to me!</p>

<p>“I should be glad to see Helen released from her
daily tasks as a governess. Poor girl, she bears it all as
bravely as, I believe, it could be borne. But it subjects
her to endless annoyances, and sometimes, I fear, to actual affronts. You remember that she had to leave Mrs. Swinburn two years ago, partly in consequence of Mr. Bristowe’s rudeness, and partly because he contrived to prejudice his aunt against her, so as to make her position at Parleyfield House unendurable. She went to another family, living about the same distance from the college, but in a different direction. There she was very comfortable for a while, though she did not get
so high a salary, and when you were at home for a fortnight last Christmas, she thought she was likely to remain with Mrs. Sandham for several years. But about a week after you left, she suddenly received notice that Mrs. Sandham did not mean to retain her services beyond the end of February. No reason was alleged for this step, but we heard, through Mrs. B——, that Mrs. Sandham’s eldest son was expected from the Cape, to pass the spring and summer at Parleyfield. He was to arrive in March,
and it was insinuated that, ‘as there had been unpleasant
relations with Mrs. Swinburn’s nephew in Helen’s last
situation, it was desirable to avoid the possibility of the
recurrence of anything of the kind, by making another
arrangement.’ I did not tell Helen this, of course, and
should have doubted the truth of the story, Mrs. B—— being a very ill-natured woman, and jealous of Helen’s attractions, whom she persists in regarding as a rival to her own daughter’s. But I am afraid Mrs. B—— is for once correct in her statements. It appears that Mr. Bristowe was here again last Christmas, and was a frequent visitor at Mrs. Sandham’s. I can’t help connecting these malicious tales with Mr. Bristowe, though I have no evidence of the fact.” (The reader will hardly require to be told that Mrs. Osborne’s conjectures were correct, it being Bristowe’s object to reduce the Osbornes to absolute want, if possible, in order that the temptation to Helen to accept him might be all the stronger.) “I of course
consider these rumours as unworthy of notice, but I am
sorry to see that the loss of the situation, and her inability
to get another, fret her a good deal, though she tries hard
to conceal it from me.</p>

<p>“I do not mind it for myself. We have to live a little
more plainly, and are unable to lay by anything in event
of sickness, etc. But I am grieved about Helen. It
half breaks my heart to think of parting with her, yet I
sometimes find myself wishing that some man—the very
opposite of Mr. Bristowe—would succeed in attracting her regard. At present she is quite fancy-free ; nor will
she, I am persuaded, ever listen to any man, whom she
cannot both love and respect.</p>

<p>“I have opened for you my budget of troubles, as you are not coming home so soon as I had expected. There is nothing for you to make yourself uncomfortable about; but it is right you should know all. I have no real anxiety about Helen; but I have some, I own, about you. I am half afraid, sometimes, that you are working beyond what your strength will bear. I should like to see you in all things like your father, with the one exception that you take care of yourself, as he never would. Bear this in mind, and forgive, even if she be unreasonably solicitous about you,</p>

<!-- Next paragraph is indented twice from the right in the same sized font as body text in the original text. -->

<p>“Your ever affectionate mother,<br>
“ELLEN OSBORNE.”
</p>

<hr>

<p>“ Mother is right,” said Osborne to himself, as he put
the letter into his pocket, and moved off towards his
tutor’s rooms. “I wish Helen would fancy some man
who would make her a good husband, and be a good son,
into the bargain, to mother herself, if she should ever be
left without me. There is nothing, that I know of, the
matter with me. But I sometimes have a fancy that I
shan’t be a long-lived man. Most likely it <i>is</i> a fancy,
though. I have heard that a great many men think the
same, and live to be eighty afterwards. Anyhow, I’ll get
my mother and Helen out of that college before long, if
it is in my power to do it.”</p>

<p>Wilton went to Cradock’s breakfast-party, and heard
Pilkington’s reply read out. To his great relief, and to Bristowe’s secret dismay—though he allowed no signs
of it to escape him—it contained a promise that he
would come up for the race and <i>déjeûner</i>, though he must
return the same evening to Yeovil. The day and place
were then arranged. It was agreed that the course should
be marked out on the land of Mr. Horrocks, a sporting
farmer, who lived about two miles from Witney, and with
whom several of the St. Cuthbert’s undergraduates were
acquainted. Further, the 29th of May was chosen, as the
most convenient for all parties, for the purpose. Barton
then, at Cradock’s request, wrote a line to Pilkington to
advise him of the arrangements, and the whole matter was
concluded.</p>

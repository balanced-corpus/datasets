<!-- Title: BLACK FLAGS IN THE CHANNEL. -->

<p>When Scaliger gave it as his opinion thiat piracy was practised by the English in a peculiarly able manner, the compliment was accounted for by the circumstance that public opinion had not wholly dissociated the corsair from ideas of chivalry and honour. There were still nobly-born and accomplished sea-rovers — Robin Hoods of the wave —disappointed, penniless, adventurous, eccentric gentlemen, choice in their quarry, not always athirst for gore ; and there were also mean skulkers, island-haunting thieves, the scamps of the profession, who would cut the throats of a whole crew for the matter of a basket of Greek apples.</p>

<p>Thus the worthy critic was able to discern degrees of merit in the buccaneering art, and resigned to a later age the task of pointing out that the forcible seizure of your neighbour’s goods is robbery; the cutting of peaceful throats, murder ; a profession that shall embrace these features, piracy ; and the end of piracy, Execution Dock.</p>

<p>Somethng might, indeed, be advanced in excuse of our former excellence, on the ground that Great Britain has always been of an insular character. ” I have never so much as heard of a Dutch pirate,” writes Captain Charles Johnson (A.D. seventeen hundred and twenty-four). “It is not that I believe ‘em to be a whit honester than their neighbours, but ‘tis a reproach to ourselves for our want of industry. The reason I take to be that, after a war, when the Dutch ships are laid up, they have a fishery, where their seamen find comfortable bread.”</p>

<p>As touching the bold, yet tender buccaneer — he of the long low clipper and never-missing gun, who danced around king’s cruisers as if they were but floating logs, executed manoeuvres undreamed of by any board of naval examiners, and finally popping into an inaccessible haven, burned his clipper, and became a wealthy and respected burgess —<i>he,</i> fine fellow ! yet survives —in fiction.</p>

<p>These lawless lawgivers had by no means bad ideas of what was needful for the commonwealth. There is an air of wisdom and sobriety about some of the following enactments : —</p>

<p>1. Every man has a vote in affairs of moment, and an equal title to the strong liquors.</p>

<p>2. Every man to be called fairly in turn—by list, on board of prizes —because (over and above their shares) they shall be, on these occasions, allowed a shift of clothes. But if they defraud the company to the value of a dollar, marooning [setting on shore, on some desolate cape or island] shall be their punishment.</p>

<p>3. No person to game at cards or dice for money.</p>

<p>4. Lights and candles to be put out at eight o’clock. If any of the crew remain inclined for drinking, they shall do it decently on deck.</p>

<p>6. No woman to be allowed amongst us. If any man be found seducing any of that sex to go to sea, he shall suffer death. If any woman fall into our hands, a sentry shall be put over her, to prevent ill consequences from so dangerous an instrument of division.</p>

<p>8. No striking one another on board, but every man’s quarrels to be ended on shore, at sword or pistol— thus : The quarter-master accompanies the parties with what assistance he thinks proper, and turns the disputants back to back, at such a distance. At the word of command, they turn and fire immediately (or else the piece is knocked out of their hands). If both miss, they come to their cutlasses.</p>

<p>9. No man to talk of breaking up our way of living, till each has shared a thousand pounds. The wounded to have compensation.</p>

<p>11. The musicians to have rest on the Sabbath-day.</p>

<p>After such articles, it is painful to add that certain, whose numbers are omitted, were of so terrible an import, that even the repentant criminals whose confessions furnished the above, could not be induced to
reveal them. An excellent law by the way — the ninth —that against secession. It took some time to provide every pocket, down to that of the smallest boy, with a thousand pounds in hard money ; and, usually, before that period, everybody was either too deep in crime to find safety elsewhere, or too much imbued with the greed of gain to wish for change :</p>

<div><p>Too late would the captain recede,<br>
He laments his sad trade, and would doff it;<br>
Which nothing prevented—indeed—<br>
Excepting the very great profit.</p></div>

<p>The system of privateering —letters of marque, now justly discountenanced—proved a very hotbed of piracy, and turned out many a skilful professor. The distinctions were sometimes remarkably fine, insomuch that even doctors disagreed. There was a very pretty quarrel in sixteen hundred and ninety-three, when some gentlemen rovers having been captured in the very chops of the Channel, Dr. Oldish, king’s advocate, was directed to prosecute them. To the surprise of the public, the doctor flatly refused : giving it as his opinion that ” they were no pirates, nor ought to be prosecuted as such ;” whereupon, being summoned before the Cabinet Council, Mr. Secretary Trenchard demanded the reason of his opinion.</p>

<p>DR. O. “Pirates be common enemies to all mankind, but these have a commission, signed ‘ J. R.,’ and dated at the Court of Saint Germains,
for to bring prizes and judgment into the Court of Admiralty, before Thomas Shadford, at Brest, or elsewhere.  This agreeth not with piracy.”</p>

<p>SEC. T. “But King James hath lost his sovereignty, in that he hath parted from the crown, and therewith the power of granting such commissions.”</p>

<p>Dr. O. ” A king may be deposed of his crown, and yet hath a right to war — and with it all the ways and consequences of war — pignorations and reprisals.”</p>

<p>SEC. T. “Yeah, that is law, when the King is deposed. But how if he abdicate ?”</p>

<p>DR. O. ” If he did truly abdicate, then he is no other than a private gentleman, and cannot grant commissions.” (The doctor went on to point out that King James, though driven from England, renewed the war in Ireland, where his followers were treated as enemies, not as “rogues,” and that a colourable authority remained in King James, at all events in France, where his abdication was still unrecognised.)</p>

<p>LORD DEVON. ” What if Monsieur Pompone, or any other minister of state, should grant the like commissions ?”</p>

<p>Dr. O. ” Why, then they would not be good, such power being only given to the admiral.</p>

<p>” SEC. T. and LORD FAULKLAND (in great heat). “I—-Pray, doctor, let us deal more closely with you, for your reasons are such as amount to high treason ! Pray, what do you think of the abdication ?”</p>

<p>DR. O. “That is an odious, ensnaring question. I think of the abdication as you do ; for since it is voted, ‘tis binding in England. But these men were in a foreign country, and though King James be not king <i>here,</i> yet the common reputation of him as king <i>there</i> shall excuse them.”</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Pinfold declared himself of the same opinion. Doctor Newton desired space to consider. Doctor Wallner scrupled to meddle with an affair of blood.</p>

<p>Doctor Littleton wound up the question : King James was a private person. We had no war with such ; and, if he did desire any, — ‘ ærarium non habet’ —he has no cash, no treasury, no capacity for making war. Wherefore these persons who adhere to him are not privateers, but pirates.</p>

<p>Doctor Oldish thereupon resigned ; and Doctor Littleton, who had so successfully snubbed him, succeeding to his post, tried and condemned the
prisoners.</p>

<p>The latter drew up a petition, showing, with much acuteness, how, after the surrender of Limerick, thousands of soldiers, with guns, horses, ammunition, &c., had been fairly exchanged, and allowed to pass into the service of the King of France. If so, why should King James’s <i>sea</i>-service commissioners be considered “annul ” ?</p>

<p>However, some of them, if not all, were executed.</p>

<p>The palmy days of maritime knight-errantry were, perhaps, about the beginning of the last century. The bold British captain had his full share. In justice let us say he did not always begin it ; but when the grasping Spanish West Indian authorities, on pretence of stopping free trade, commissioned armed vessels to seize every ship that ventured within fifteen miles of their coast; and when many an honest, innocent Jamaica ship fell a victim to a liberal interpretation of that decree, mercantile patience gave way, and ” something” in the way of reprisal being winked at, soon grew into a very bulky matter indeed.</p>

<p>For, quite a little fleet—two ships and three sloops—sailing from Jamaica, under Captain Henry Jennings, to the Gulf of Florida, there found the Spaniards busy, at the bottom of the sea, groping for the relics of their Plate fleet, lost there two years before. A little exchange of civilities ensued, ending in the departure of Captain Henry Jennings with the whole of the recovered treasure (excepting what had been previously sent to the Havanna), amounting, with the proceeds of a Spanish vessel bagged on the way home, to four hundred and ten thousand pieces of eight, or about ninety thousand pounds.</p>

<p>The Spaniards complained to the Jamaica Government. The latter—first permitting the adventurers to dispose of their cargo to good advantage, and furnish themselves with all necessary stores — frankly repudiated the entire transaction ; and Captain Jennings, placed without the pale of the law, put to sea.</p>

<p>Reprisal begets reprisal. The Spaniards, with some small war-ships, fell upon our vessels, twenty-one in number, cutting logwood in Campeachy Bay. The prisoners, crowded into three sloops, were set at liberty, and, in their despoiled and desperate condition, falling in with the rovers, threw in their lot among their countrymen.</p>

<p>Even these children of the sea need some friendly haven, and an occasional dockyard ; and Providence, the largest of the Bahamas, with a fine harbour, was henceforth their chosen refuge. From this point, the gentlemen carried on their game so much to the discontent of the whole sea-going public, that some vigorous steps became indispensable. George Rex accordingly sent a proclamation, and a fleet numbering fourteen vessels, with three hundred and thirty-six guns (not Armstrong’s) to enforce it.</p>

<p>The proclamation went first, and was captured, ship and all. But, the fleet approaching, things took a turn, and a somewhat disorderly debate resulted in the surrender of Commodore Jennings and his most distinguished lieutenants, including the honoured names of Hornigold, Teach (the renowned Black-beard), Martel, Fife, Williams, La Bouche, Pennar, England, Burgess, Cocklyn, Sample, and Vane.</p>

<p>If it be permitted to dispose at once, parenthetically, of this band of illustrious men, it is only more effectually to point the moral of their tale. Thus then it befell :</p>

<p>Hornigold, Williams, Burgess, La Bouche—cast away.</p>

<p>Teach and Pennar, slain, and their crews taken.</p>

<p>Fife killed by his own men.</p>

<p>Martel left on an uninhabited island.</p>

<p>Cocklyn, Sample, Vane —hanged.</p>

<p>England (most hapless of all), married, at point of stake, to an aged princess of Madagascar.</p>

<p>Some of these worthies, as may be surmised, from the nature of their end, merely made a feint of surrendering, and returned, on the first opportunity, to their former mode of life. Among the rest, Vane escaped at once in a small swift vessel, firing a gun at the nearest king’s ship as he departed.</p>

<p>The royal commodore, Rogers, now established himself in the island, and, forming the remainder of the quondam rovers into a sort of naval reserve, under proper command, endeavoured to employ them in legitimate trade.</p>

<p>This, however, was not so easy, as was soon exemplified in the case of John Augur, a steady and respectable old pirate, whose good conduct had induced the governor to entrust him with the command of a provision-sloop. Unluckily, on John’s very first trip, two strange sloops spoke him. During the dialogue, the old corsairs’ impulse came upon him with such irresistible power, that in the twinkling of an eye, the two strangers were despoiled of money and goods, and he himself was on his way in search of fresh adventures. The expedition, however, was cut prematurely short by a tornado, which dismasted the sloop, and forced her back on the Bahama group, where the crew were captured, taken back to Providence, tried, and condemned, ten in number, on the evidence of the eleventh.</p>

<p>Crowds of their ancient comrades stood round the scaffold; but the power of law was dominant; there was no thought of rescue. “I had never thought to see the time,” shouted one of the criminals in despair, ” that ten such men as we should be tied up, and hanged like dogs, with four hundred of their sworn companions standing by ! “</p>

<p>The taking of Providence, though it broke up a dangerous combination, scattered the elements of piracy far and wide. The backsliding of John Augur augured badly for any future confidence that might be reposed in pirate penitence, and inactivity soon becoming intolerable, one by one the ex-professors slipped off and renewed their former course. Nor was it always prudent to pursue. So catching was the epidemic, that the officer frequently became the thief. For example, those unlucky captains, George Dew and Richard Tew, having been commissioned to attack the French at Goree, set sail with honest enough purpose ; but George being driven back in a storm, Richard, continuing his voyage alone, encountered temptation in the shape of a rich Indiaman. So he plundered the rich Indiaman, and, sharing with his crew wealth sufficient to give even the common sailors three thousand pounds apiece, steered for Rhode Island.</p>

<p>How pirate made pirate is well illustrated by the fact that four of the most remarkable rover-captains of their time had been prisoners to each other. Wynter (himself a prisoner to pirates) took England, England took Davis, Davis took the renowned Bartholomew Roberts. England’s maiden essay was the capture of a British barque, the <i>Pearl</i>, which he fitted up ” on the piratical account,” and therewith took, in one cruise, nine other British vessels : out of the crews of which at least one-half took voluntary service with their captors. Good Captain England was a remarkably successful commander, but, having an objectionable taint of generosity about him, gradually lost credit with his men, and was marooned with two other over-gentlemanly persons on the coast of Madagascar. His lamentable fate has been told.</p>

<p>Davis, taken by the above, was a native of Milford ; honest and brave, he refused to sign the piratical articles, swearing he would rather be shot, as they had shot his captain : whereupon the rover bade him return on board his own ship, and make sail. He also gave him sealed orders to be opened in a certain latitude ; which being done, they were found to contain a free gift of both ship and cargo to Davis and his men. Again the tempter had all but triumphed. Davis, indeed, desired to follow the liberal instructions they had received, but the men refused, and, proceeding to their proper destination, gave him up to the authorities. Nevertheless, having as yet been guilty of no act of piracy, he was speedily released, and thence sailed for Providence, intending to join the rovers. Finding the island in possession of the Government, he took service in a small trading sloop, corrupted the crew, and, seizing the vessel, captured a larger, and commenced a career seldom equalled in the history of wild adventure.</p>

<p>Roberts, taken by the above, sailed from London ” in an honest employ ” — that is to say, for Guinea, to take in slaves—when he was himself made prisoner. This occurred immediately before the death of his captor; an event which threw the honourable company into great disorder, there being at the moment no one worthy to succeed him. A sort of cabinet council was, therefore, convened, at which the leading members of the company, who had given themselves the title of ” lords,” expressed their views.</p>

<p>So far as cabinet secrets have been suffered to transpire, my Lord Ashplant (over a bowl) proposed —</p>

<p>” That it was no signification who was dignified with title, seeing that all good Governments had the supreme power lodged in the community. Should a captain be so saucy ” (such were his Lordship’s emphatic words) “as at any time to exceed prescription, why <i>down taith him !</i> It will be a caution to his successor. However, it is my advice that, before we get fully drunk, we pitch upon a man of courage (and navigation) who shall ward us from the dangers of an instable element and the consequence of falling by the ears, and such a one I take Roberts to be. A fellow, I think, in all respects entitled to your esteem and favour.”</p>

<p>The noble lord’s address was received with much applause, but my Lord Sympson, an ambitious, and at that moment, somewhat intoxicated person, swore that in his opinion they had made a foul choice—yet, after all, it mattered little who was chosen, so it wasn’t a Papist ; and, his religious scruples having been set at rest, he staggered sulkily away.</p>

<p>Mr. Roberts was then called in, and having been duly informed of the honour conferred on him, accepted it in a speech of much modesty, but of doubtful compliment : concluding that, ” Since he had dipped his hands in muddy water, and <i>must</i> go a-pirating, ‘twas better being a commander than a common man.”</p>

<p>The new captain’s success bade fair to eclipse that of his predecessor, and he was yet in the full tide of prosperity, when my Lord Walter Kennedy — a turbulent peer, who acted as first mate — availed himself of the temporary absence of his chief to make off with the ship and treasure. His lordship, however, whose early education had been confided to an eminent pickpocket, possessed so little skill in navigation, that he quickly lost influence with his men, and, the company breaking up, my lord, with a few followers, made sail for the Irish Channel. Here they encountered such severe storms, that, so far from making prizes, they had the utmost difficulty in preserving their own precious lives. At length, they made the north-west coast of Scotland, ran their vessel ashore in a small estuary, and landing, marched up the country. Betrayed by their own riotous, roaring manners, seventeen of the number were presently lodged in gaol : nine of whom were afterwards hanged. Lord Kennedy, with one attendant, escaped for the time, but imprudently venturing to London, was recognised by the mate of a plundered ship, and committed to the Marshalsea.</p>

<p>Nothing now remained to the persecuted noble but to turn king’s evidence ; he accordingly lost not a moment in denouncing some fifteen of his most intimate and particular friends. Unluckily, he was not able to give their addresses, and one only being taken (who was acquitted), my lord was himself arraigned, and made his last public appearance, amidst a large concourse of unsympathising persons, on the nineteenth of July, seventeen hundred and twenty-one.</p>

<p>To return to our true hero, Captain Roberts. That energetic officer, losing no time in weak regrets, at once reorganised his band, supplied himself with a fresh ship, and went to work again as vigorously as ever. We may not follow him step by step, but must jump at once to the crowning exploit of his illustrious career.</p>

<p>What gallant stranger is this, gliding into Whydal Roads, with the ensign of St. George, a black silk flag at his mizen-peak, and a jack and pennant of the same ? The flag hath a death in it, with an hour-glass in one hand and cross-bones in the other; and, underneath, a heart dropping three drops of blood.</p>

<p>Here are eleven sail in the road—of all nations, some carrying thirty guns, but one glance at the black silk flag is enough for them. All strike, and pay different amounts of ransom. The ceremony is presided over by gallant figure, dressed in rich crimson damask waistcoat and breeches, a red feather in his hat, gold chain round his neck, with a diamond cross appended to it, a sword in his hand, and two pair of pistols at the end of a silk sling, flung over his shoulders. The receipt he gives as follows: —</p>

<p>which is held not to invalidate the instrument, but rather to legalize it, as showing the perfect goodwill and humour with which the whole affair was conducted.</p>

<p>This was his last adventure:—</p>

<!-- Next paragraph is not indented.-->

<p>From that day forth, the avenger—in the shape of his Majesty’s ships <i>Swallow</i> and <i>Weymouth</i>—dogged his every step, until, on the morning of the tenth of February, as Captain Roberts is at breakfast in his cabin, in company with a gentleman whose vessel he has just captured—the meal being composed of a savoury dish of ” Solomon Gundy,” and some of the prisoner’s beer—the king’s cruiser suddenly rounds the Cape. The greater part of the crew are drunk, passively courageous, unfit for service. Notwithstanding, the dauntless rover, in pursuance of a hastily-arranged plan, steers straight for the man-of-war, receives and returns her fire, and then, hoisting his black flag, shoots away with all the sail he can pack. The helmsman is unsteady, the ship is taken aback, and the enemy is again at hand. At this critical moment a grape-shot
struck the rover in the throat. He settled himself on the tackles of a gun, which one Stephenson observing, ran to his assistance ; but, not seeing his hurt, swore at him and bade him stand up and fight like a man. However, when he found his captain was certainly dead, he gushed into tears, and wished the next shot might be his lot. They presently threw him overboard with his arms and ornaments on, as he had ordered in his lifetime.</p>

<p>Roberts was one of the latest of his type of sea-ranger. The Peace of Ryswick, which laid up the privateer, deprived many an honest thief of the only means of livelihood he had taught himself to relish. ” A merry life, and a short one,” might still be his motto ; but if it were merry, it was also unquestionably short ; for the police of the seas was vindicating itself, and the pirate no longer possessed a single haven that he could call his own. Some petty buccaneering, hardly deserving
of the name, continued, however, to be done ; and, oddly enough, our own well-guarded coasts were generally the scene; the honest industrious Dutchman the victim. Thus, in seventeen hundred and sixty-eight, a band of daring fellows, hovering on the Kent and Sussex shores, defied for a long period all attempts to catch them. Making the port of Hastings their rendezvous, they boarded and robbed numbers of ships coming up channel, and lived for seven years wholly upon the fruit of their depredations. At length the ruffians, encountering a large richly-freighted Dutch ship that offered unusual resistance, murdered the whole crew and burned the vessel ; after which, they returned to Hastings to dispose of the plunder and enjoy themselves. Fortunately, one of the miscreants was overheard jesting with a comrade, respecting the entertaining manner in which one of the murdered Dutchmen “wriggled” about, after having his backbone nearly severed with an axe. Information was forwarded to the authorities in London, who despatched a strong party of military to Hastings, while a vessel of war anchored in the roadstead.</p>

<p>On the day following the arrival of the soldiers, which had been managed with great secrecy, the mayor was openly accosted by one of the pirate gang, who demanded the meaning of the war-ship’s appearance, and the rumour of the arrival of military. His worship, refusing explanation, was instantly set upon by his questioner, and by others of the band who had been lurking near; but some soldiers opportunely arriving, a fight ensued, resulting in the capture of the pirates, who, with other of their associates subsequently taken, were sent to London and lodged in the Marshalsea.</p>

<p>In seventeen hundred and twenty-nine occurred the singular case of John Smith, whose real name was Gow. This worthy sailed as mate in the <i>George,</i> from a Scotch haven. The crew consisted of twenty-four. At the head of eight of these, Gow rose one night upon the officers, murdered the captain, surgeon, chief mate, and supercargo, and, hoisting the black flag, steered for Spain. Four more of the crew had voluntarily cast in their lot with them ; the rest were retained to do the harder work of the ship and treated with extreme cruelty. They had a tolerably successful cruise, but, having become somewhat notorious in that
locality, it became advisable to shift the scene, and Gow accordingly steered for the Orkneys. While lying at anchor in a secluded bay, one of the crew, who had been detained against his will, escaped, and hastening to Kirkwall, alarmed the authorities. Ten more of the dissatisfied crew departed in the long-boat. In spite of these ominous circumstances, the daring leader not only did not put to sea, but organized a land expedition, in which they plundered the house of Mr. High-Sheriff Honeyman of all that was portable; compelling that gentleman’s piper to head the return procession, playing a triumphal march.</p>

<p>From hence, Gow proceeded to call upon (and plunder) an old friend and schoolfellow, Mr. Fea, who resided at the small adjacent island, Calf Sound. Mr. Fea was a man of courage and discretion. By the
joint exercise of these qualities, he not only made prisoners of the party sent ashore, but ultimately of the whole of the dangerous and desperate band, twenty-eight in number. Gow, and six others, suffered at Execution Dock ; the former’s case being rendered more notable by his obstinate refusal to plead. However, when on the point of being pressed to death, he relented, and was convicted with the rest.</p>

<p>Among the last of the “gentlemen of fortune” who courted that goddess’s favour in British waters, was Mr. George Wood, who sailed from Bristol in seventeen hundred and sixty-nine, in the <i>Black Prince.</i> They were barely at sea before the crew mutinied, made the officers prisoners, and were debating as to the mode in which they should be put to death, when the earnest entreaties of the victims induced them to consent that they should be simply turned adrift in a small boat, slenderly provisioned. After doing this at such a distance from land that the unfortunate men set adrift were never heard of again, the pirates hoisted the black flag and sailed for Brazil, making prizes in their way. While in port, one of their company fell under the suspicion of a purpose to run away : whereupon a regular court-martial was held and the culprit sentenced to be hanged at the yard-arm, the execution being deferred only long enough to enable the exemplary captain to read a long printed sermon to the condemned.</p>

<p>It was reserved for a brutal miscreant, named Philip Roche, to cap the horrors of modern piracy. This man, residing at Cork, resolved to turn sea-robber, and, drawing one Neal, a fisherman, two brothers, Cullen, and a man named Wise, into a confederacy, took passage with them in a French vessel about to sail for Nantz. Roche was himself so able a sailor, that he was frequently allowed to take charge of the ship. One dark November night—the master and mate being both asleep in their cabin—Roche and his accomplices seized and murdered the four Frenchmen left on deck; not, however, without resistance; Roche himself declaring, in his subsequent confession, that they were ” all over wet with blood, as if they had been dipped in water. Nor did they regard it more.” The poor master and mate, alarmed, and hastening on deck, were seized, tied back to back, and thrown into the sea.</p>

<p>Roche now steered for Lisbon ; but meeting with very bad weather, ran back, and put into Dartmouth, where he hired three more hands, and sailed again for Rotterdam. Here a gentleman, named Annesley, freighted and took passage in their vessel to England ; but on the way, in a rude and stormy night, ” it being very dark, they took up their passenger and flung him overboard —who swam about the ship a pretty while, calling out for life, and telling them they should have all his goods for ransom, but in vain.” Roche was shortly afterwards taken, and immediately proposed to turn evidence, promising to convict three others, ” worse than himself.” Justice readily accepted these conditions ; and Roche only discovering two, who were comparatively innocent, paid well-deserved forfeit at Execution Dock.</p>

<p>It may be permitted, by way of postscript to these notes, to refer to a very singular story lately revived by a gentleman who addressed a public meeting on the subject of the American ” difficulty,” and who, in doing so, also named Captain Wilkes, of the <i>San Jacinto,</i> as the hero of the tale. Friends of the latter gentleman have since separated his name from any concern in the matter ; but seeing that time has let slip some few of the attendant circumstances and has misrepresented others, here, in brief, is the true narrative : —</p>

<p>The United States brig-of-war <i>Somers,</i> ten guns, the ship’s company numbering in all seventy-five persons, was returning home in December, eighteen hundred and forty- two, from the African station, under the command of Lieutenant-Commander Slidell Mackenzie—brother, it is understood, of the Southern Commissioner, he having assumed the latter name.</p>

<p>When within three days’ sail of St. Thomas’s, it came to the captain’s knowledge that a mutiny was projected on board, under the direction of Midshipman Philip Spencer, a youth of nineteen, the son or nephew of the then secretary-at-war—the other ringleaders being Samuel Cromwell, boatswain’s mate, and Elisha Small, seaman.</p>

<p>The informant was the purser’s steward, Wales, to whom the conspirators had imparted a portion of their scheme, and who affected co-operation in order to learn more. He was, nevertheless, so narrowly watched, that, finding it impossible to communicate with the captain, he revealed the whole to the purser, who promptly made it known. Thereupon Spencer, Cromwell, and Small were secured, and the former’s papers being examined, the whole nefarious plot appeared, set forth to the minutest detail.</p>

<p>The brig was to be captured at Saint Thomas’s, because at that port she could be best provided with stores, water, &c., for the piratical cruise which was to follow. (It may be mentioned that the <i>Somers</i> was a new vessel, a very fast sailer; in fact, in construction, size, and speed, the beau ideal of a pirate !) At the time agreed upon, a scuffle was to be raised on the forecastle, while the deck was in charge of Midshipman Rogers, who was to be seized and flung overboard, Spencer was then to enter the cabin and kill the captain : while others, stationed at the steerage-hatch. were to murder the whole of the remaining officers as they came up : the surgeon excepted. The crew were then to be mustered, and all who refused to join the mutineers were to be thrown overboard.</p>

<p>This completed, they were to make for the Isle of Pines, where they were to meet a confederate, then cruising off New York, capture every ship they could, murder all the males, and sink the vessel, so that nothing should be left to tell the horrible tale. The arrangements for division of spoil, and the allotment of female prisoners, with other laws, were also drawn up in detail in Spencer’s handwriting.</p>

<p>The whole plan was interlarded with Greek characters, by way of disguise; and the test oath was to be:—</p>

<p>“Do you swear that you have no fear of shedding blood ?”</p>

<p>A painful responsibility rested upon Captain Mackenzie, in dealing with a case so new and terrible. Who could say how far the contamination had spread? To crush at all hazards was his solemn duty. A drum-head court-martial was convened, and was decided that the safety of the vessel and the lives of all on board, demanded nothing short of the prompt and immediate execution of the three ringleaders.</p>

<p>One hour was accorded to the guilty and unhappy men, and, at its expiration, the three were hanged at the yard-arm, in presence of the whole crew. Between ten and twenty sailors, suspected of complicity, were placed in irons, and conveyed to New York for trial.</p>

<p>Some attempt has been made to fix upon Captain Mackenzie the charge of over-severity, as also to show that the extreme penalty was thus promptly carried out in opposition to the wishes and earnest entreaties of most of the officers. There is no ground whatever for the latter assertion. As to the former, we may leave Captain Mackenzie’s defence to the pen of an American commentator of the time :—</p>

<p>” Let the mind for a moment picture to itself the fastest vessel in our service, fully manned and equipped, a piratical brig, hovering on our shores, and laying wait for vessels between this port and every other in the world. Imagine but a portion of the horrors that must have resulted from the consummation of this hellish purpose, and then, if you can,
condemn him who has fearlessly discharged a most painful duty, and assumed the power to carry into effect the <i>spirit</i> of our laws, when in a position where its <i>forms</i> could not be complied with.”</p>

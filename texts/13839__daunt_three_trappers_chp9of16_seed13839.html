<p>When the youths arose, they found that old Jake had left the camp, in the canoe; but as he had left his traps behind, they felt little anxiety at his absence. Gaultier filled the camp-kettle, while Pierre kindled the fire ; the blankets were rolled up, and the various articles of their luggage were disposed so as to be ready for immediate removal. Their simple meal was soon ready, and they were debating whether to wait the return of their companion ere they commenced, when that worthy was seen rounding the bend in the Askow opposite the camp, and urging the canoe forwards with swift strokes of the paddles. In a few minutes the bows of the canoe grated gently on the sandy margin of the river, and old Jake landed, his hands and arms covered with blood.</p>

<p>” Why, Jake,” said Pierre, ” where did you get all that blood ? What have you been doing ? I hope you haven’t wounded yourself.”</p>

<p>” I guess I hevn’t, young fellur,” replied the trapper. ” I’ve been takin’ the skin off that thur grizzly we throwed last night. ‘Twur o’ no use leavin’ the peltry to rot, an’ so I’ve brought it wi’ me. We’d better slap in our fodder now quick,” he continued, “an’ make a start. It’s a long way to our next camp, an’ we’ll need all our time to do it in before night.”</p>

<p>The three accordingly sat round the camp-fire and addressed themselves with keen appetites to their fare of jerked buffalo-meat and coffee. They did not, as may be supposed, linger long over their breakfast, which presented little to induce them to prolong it. Their different effects were speedily collected and placed in the canoe ; and with a final glance around to see that nothing was forgotten, they took their places, and were soon cleaving the swift waters of the Saskatchewan.</p>

<p>For a few days they journeyed as rapidly westward as the strength of the stream and the weight of the canoe would permit, stopping only for their midday meal, and about an hour before sundown to make their camp for the night.</p>

<p>The country seemed entirely uninhabited, rolling plains extending on either hand to the horizon, devoid of vegetation, and presenting in their utter sterility little to cheer the spirits of our trappers. Far in the west, however, these great heaving plains seemed to rise and swell into low hills, which formed the sky-line in that direction, topped here and there by a snowy peak, which Jake informed his companions rose from the Rocky Mountain chain. Gradually the river banks became higher, and occasionally assumed the form of cliffs, on the scarped summits of which the mountain pine reared its bushy head or flung its contorted branches abroad over the verge. Its melancholy foliage, by contrast with the desert regions through which the trappers had lately passed, impressed them with an idea of verdure, and seemed an earnest of the cool, shady forests which formed the theme of Jake’s conversation.</p>

<p>They did not leave the plains, however, without again having a brush with their former foes the Blackfeet.</p>

<p>One day, while struggling through a cañon whose rugged walls rose to a great height on both sides of the stream, Gaultier, happening to glance upwards, was startled to observe several Indians, who no sooner felt themselves discovered than with wild yells they hurled down large stones or detached huge boulders from the cliffs, which thundered down the precipice and dashed the water into spray around the canoe.</p>

<p>Several of the savages who possessed fire-arms ran some distance up-stream, and took their stand behind a few rocks and bushes at a point where the cliffs had apparently broken away and left a steep and rock-encumbered declivity towards the river. From this position they could command a better view of the canoe, and with ready rifles they awaited its approach. Old Jake’s restless eye, however, which glanced above, below, behind, and before, suddenly fell upon a recess in the rocky wall, immediately under the yelling savages above, over which projected a ledge or shelf. Instantly his resolve was taken. ” Yonder’s our ground,” he exclaimed, and at the word the canoe was impelled into the narrow opening, where for the present they were safe.</p>

<p>” How lucky it was for us,” said Pierre, ” that they showed themselves here!  If they had attacked us lower down, they would have had us at a great disadvantage.”</p>

<p>” I think,” said Gaultier, ” that they’ve followed us
for some time. I thought I saw something moving along the top of the bluffs half an hour ago, but wasn’t sure enough, and so I said nothing.”</p>

<p>” I wonder,” said Pierre, ” what tribe they are ; I hadn’t time to notice their paint.”</p>

<p> ” <i>I</i> I had, though,” exclaimed old Jake; “I knows the varmints’ ugly picturs well enough. Them’s Blackfeet ! Boyees,” he continued, ” we’re in a tight place, I guess. Ef we goes out o’ hyur, them coons
above’ll shower donnicks atop o’ us an’ sink the canoe ; an’ ef we escapes them, thur’s the fellurs as took cover wi’ their rifles a-waitin’ fur us a leetle furrer up. But we’ll walk into them niggurs, I reckon. Ye-es! old Jake Hawken ain’t a-gwine to go under yit ; no, that he ain’t ! “</p>

<p>Pierre inquired of the old hunter what plan he recommended.</p>

<p>” It ain’t much of a plan,” he replied. ” I reckon we’ll jest wait here till it’s dark ; that won’t be long, I guess, at the bottom o’ this cañon. We’ll then slip back a bit, an’ git round the skunks from t’other side. They won’t be expectin’ us from that p’int, an’ then we’ll gi’ ‘em goss, you bet.”</p>

<p>The minutes which followed were passed almost in silence. The hunters listened with keen attention for any sound which might indicate the approach of their enemies or betray their intentions. But the stillness was unbroken save by the rush of the water the rocks, or the moan of the wind, which blew in fitful gusts through the cañon and seemed to herald an approaching storm. Pierre, who was struck by the barrenness of the country through which they had travelled for some time, inquired of old Jake if it often rained in these regions.</p>

<p>” It diz at times,” replied the trapper ; ” an’ it wur o’ that sarcumstance this child wur thinkin’. It’ll be okard ef it comes down in a flood sich as I’ve seed hyur away.”</p>

<p>” How so ? ” said Gaultier. ” Is it that you are afraid of getting your old carcass soaked through ? “</p>

<p>“No,” replied Jake, slightly nettled by what he thought a reflection on his manhood, ” it ain’t that. Don’t ye see that ef it rains as it diz hyur now an’ then, we’ll be swep’ out o’ this gulch like a chip. Thur ain’t a boat on old Mississippi as cud hold agin the flood comes through hyur ; an’ them coons above knows that too, I reckon. Ef it comes down in raal earnest, as seems likely, <i>they</i>‘ll meet us below; be sure o’ that, young fellur.”</p>

<p>This was a new and startling view of the situation, and one which had not occurred to either Pierre or Gaultier. They eagerly scanned the slender strip of the darkening heavens which showed above the opposite wall of the cañon, and in the masses of black cloud which hurried across it they saw the confirmation of their fears. The rain was, in fact, already falling in large drops, though somewhat thinly. Sudden fierce gusts rushed up the river, tearing the surface into foam ; and in the pauses between them, distant rumblings and moanings were heard, which seemed to portend an unusual strife of the elements.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour the three hunters sat silent and thoughtful, apparently impressed with the dangers of their situation, and probably debating the chances of their escape. They were aware that certain death would be the result of falling into the hands of the Indians. They were ignorant of the numbers of their wily foes, bands of whom might be prowling along both banks of the river. But they cheered themselves with the hope that the swiftness of the current and the darkness of a stormy night would enable them to slip past unperceived. There was something humiliating in the thought that they had to turn tail to a handful of savages, whose position alone invested them with importance. On an open plain they would not have hesitated to attack double the number of their present foes, confident in the perfection of their arms and in their own skill in wielding them; but here these would avail them little, as the enemy was hidden from view, while <i>they</i> were fully exposed to whatever missiles were hurled against them.</p>

<p>While following these anxious trains of thought, darkness had fully fallen on the river. High above, however, a faint light revealed the jagged sky-line of the enclosing precipices, showing that twilight still continued beyond the shadow of the rocks. The rain now fell in torrents, hissing in the seething river and plashing against the cliffs with a relentless fury. Thunder rolled through the murky sky, accompanied by such vivid lightning as pained the sight and left its impress on the retina for several seconds afterwards.</p>

<p>“Them fireworks’ll diskiver us, I reckon,” said Jake; “but ‘tain’t o’ no use waitin’ longer. The water’s risin.’ See,” he continued, “when we comed in hyur a while agone, it wur eight feet to the top o’ this cave ; it’s not five now. I guess we’d better streak it.”</p>

<p>So saying, the old hunter shoved the canoe out into the river, and in a moment they were hurrying down the cañon at a pace which promised to carry them to its mouth in as many minutes as it had taken them hours to ascend. The canoe was steered towards the opposite side of the stream, which was there deep and rapid, and seemed also less obstructed in its course.</p>

<p>” Keep your eyes skinned, fellurs,” whispered Jake, ” an’ don’t ye go fur to run on the rocks. One graze, I guess, an’ we’ll all go under, sartain.”</p>

<p>” I think,” said Pierre, who steered, ” we had better keep more out in the stream ; it is so dark, I can’t see ten yards ahead. The rocks—” He was interrupted by a blinding flash which actually crackled as it cleft the darkness, revealing the turbid river, the frowning faces of the cliffs, the boat and its occupants with the utmost vividness. A stunning crash of thunder followed instantaneously, and in the comparative silence which followed, the hunters thought they heard yells high above them along the summit of the crags.</p>

<p>” Jest as I thort,” said Jake ; ” them skunks seed the boat that last flash. Thur’s a chance o’ our bein’ below before ‘em, though. I know o’ a gully or crack that runs along above thur. It’ll take ‘em a leetle time to cross an’ ain’t more’n a matter o’ five miles now to the mouth o’ this cañon. guess we’ll beat ‘em arter all.”</p>

<p>” Unless,” said Pierre, ” there are others below.”</p>

<p>” I don’t think that ur likely,” observed Jake. ” Ye see the varmints didn’t know we wur a-comin’, an’ so I guess thur’s none but what we’ve seed o’ them.</p>

<p>The party again relapsed into silence. The light boat flew along, impelled both by the paddles and by the swift current, which surged alongside as it bounded over obstacles far down in its dismal depths. The storm continued with unabated fury, and the rain poured its chilling torrents upon the hunters, whose buckskin clothing speedily became wet through, and clung to their bodies, causing the youths to shiver notwithstanding their exertions. As for Jake, that case-hardened veteran little heeded this inconvenience. He was much more solicitous about keeping Plumcentre dry, or stowing away his spare ammunition in a place of safety, than in protecting himself from the pitiless deluge, which really threatened to swamp the boat.</p>

<p>” It can’t go on long at this rate,” said Pierre ; ” it will soon rain itself out. I’d rather fight those demons above there than be drowned like a rat in a hole down here.”</p>

<p>“I hope it ain’t a-gwine to stop yit,” said Jake. ” Ef it diz, them clouds’ll go, an’ the moon’ll show out clur. That’s jest what them niggurs’d like. No ; I reckon the rain’ll do my old legs no harm, nor yours neyther, young fellurs.”</p>

<p>The minutes flew swiftly by. Already they recognized a high pinnacle, which was just visible against the scarcely lighter sky, and which they remembered having noticed very soon after entering the cañon. Accordingly the cliffs at either side diminished rapidly in height, and presently they found themselves floating past low rocky banks which presented no obstacle to their landing. Here, therefore, they left the canoe, securing it to a paddle fastened firmly between two large boulders. A couple of buffalo skins were carefully stretched across the boat to protect the contents from the rain; and then shouldering their rifles, they clambered over the rocks in the direction from which they expected their enemies to appear.</p>

<p>It seemed as if Pierre’s wish was to be gratified, for the wind, which had hitherto blown with great violence, now moderated somewhat, and the rain ceased altogether. Heavy masses of cloud, however, still coursed across the heavens, and through their rifts the moon shed a partial light, rendering some objects distinct, while all around was wrapped in gloom. For some time the party advanced in comparative silence, the only sounds being those occasioned by the difficulties of the path encumbered with rocks and loose stones. Old Jake led the van. and this son of the woods from time to time uttered some thing very like an oath, as his moccasined foot slipped on wet rock or was too firmly planted on a sharp flint. Suddenly he halted and listened intently for a few moments. He was about to move forward again, as if satisfied that his suspicions were groundless, when a flash shot from over a low wall of boulders about fifty yards in front, followed by a short report.</p>

<p>” Down wi’ ye!” exclaimed Jake; and instantly the three hunters threw themselves to the earth, taking advantage of whatever cover the spot afforded. “I knowed it,” hissed the old man. “I guessed the critturs would make fur the mouth o’ the cañon. Now, boys, git yer shootin’ sticks ready; make a sieve o’ whatever moves about them rocks, — d’ye hear?”</p>

<p>The party kept their eyes riveted on the range of boulders across which the moon occasionally threw an uncertain light ; but more frequently the shadows of heavy clouds rendered all objects dim and indistinct. Pierre and Gaultier lay side by side, each behind a large stone, which would serve at once as rests for their rifles and to shield them from the bullets of the enemy.</p>

<p>“I see something glistening,” whispered Pierre. ” See ! in the opening between the two big rocks. There ! it moves.”</p>

<p>Gaultier’s eye sought the spot, and as the moon again shone clearly, saw the object which had attracted Pierre’s attention. ” I’ll try it anyhow ! ” exclaimed the latter; and raising his rifle, he sighted rapidly and fired. A wild yell answered the shot, as a naked savage bounded over the rocks, and fell forward, lying motionless on his face.</p>

<p>“That niggur’s rubbed out,” said Jake. “Well done, young fellur. See if ye can’t fetch another. Thur’s more o’ ‘em behint them rocks. Ef they’d only show out, we’d gi’ ‘em goss.</p>

<p>The savages still kept themselves well sheltered by the natural breastwork behind which they crouched, occasionally firing shots which, luckily for the trappers, were ill directed ; and yelling like furies, probably hoping to terrify the hunters into flight, when they would have a chance of taking each separately. They did not venture to charge, well knowing that at close quarters the hunters were more than a match for them.</p>

<p>” By the yells, Jake,” said Pierre, ” I think there aren’t more than half-a-dozen of the wretches. What do you say to charging them ? If we don’t, they’ll keep us here until morning, when they’ll pick us off
easily.”</p>

<p>” I wur thinkin’ o’ that,” said Jake. ” When the moon goes in next, let’s streak it in among ‘em, an’ I guess your rifles’ll make quick work o’ the varmints. Lend me one o’ yer six-shooters, though; it’s better’n my own.”</p>

<p>In a few moments the drifting clouds again cast a deep shadow on the earth, and at a signal the hunters sprang to their feet, and crouched forwards, clambering as quietly as possible over the stones. They had almost reached the barrier ere the Indians observed them, and with a loud cheer they sprang over the boulders and leaped down among their lurking foes. Shots followed each other in rapid succession, mingled with yells and the wild oaths of old Jake. Pierre singled out a brawny savage who was in the act of loosing an arrow from his bow within a yard of his breast. Leaping aside, he felt the arrow-point tear the flesh under his right arm. Instantly he closed with the savage, who parried his knife-thrusts with a tomahawk, and suddenly grasping Pierre with an iron grip, he forced him backwards against the rocks, over which both stumbled and fell, the savage being uppermost. With an exultant yell the Indian raised his tomahawk to deal the fatal blow ; but before the weapon could descend, Gaultier, who saw his cousin’s danger, sprang upon the savage, and hurled him to the ground several yards from his victim, while at the same moment his revolver flashed, and the Indian, who was about to spring to his feet, reeled forward and rolled over on his back dead.</p>

<p>Pierre quickly rose and looked around. Five Red skins lay dead upon the spot ; but where was Jake ? He was nowhere visible. They listened attentively, and presently they heard above the whistling of the wind the sounds of strife apparently proceeding from behind a mass of huge boulders at a little distance. The fitful moonlight served to guide them, and on reaching the spot they beheld the old hunter bravely defending himself against two savages, old Jake parrying their blows with his rifle.  Springing forward with a cheer, Pierre struck one Indian a crushing blow with his rifle-butt which levelled him to the earth ; while a bullet from Gaultier’s revolver prostrated the other, who had attempted to escape as soon as he saw them arrive to Jake’s assistance.</p>

<p>” Thank’ee, lads, thank’ee,” said Jake; “ye jest kem in time, I reckon. I wur gettin’ tired o’ the bisness; an’ two to one ain’t fair. I guess, though, I’ve rubbed out a wheen o’ the varmints. Them pistols o’ yours air great weapons, sure enough. I throwed three o’ the skunks the fust three shots, when I wur set upon by them two. The pistol missed fire at one o’ ‘em, an’ before I cud draw ag’in, the thing wur clinked out o’ my hand wi’ a blow o’ a tomahawk. They pressed me so hard that I wur obleeged to give ground, so that’s how I kem to be separated from ye.”</p>

<p>Pierre mentioned his own encounter and Gaultier’s timely aid, without which, he said, he certainly would have ” gone under.”</p>

<p>“I expect we hev all done one another sarvice, lad,” said Jake. ” The fust niggur I pulled upon hed his hand twisted in Gaultier’s ha’r, an’ would hev made a raise as sure as shootin’ ef I hadn’t put in my say. But we’re well out o’ the thing anyhow, an’ I think we’d better make fur the canoe an’ hev something to eat. I’m a’most like a knife, I’m so hungry. But fust o’ all we’ll hev a squint at them skunks.” So saying, the hunter stooped, and catching the outstretched arm of the nearest savage, he pulled him over on his back.</p>

<p>At this moment the moon shone clearly, lighting up the grim face of the corpse, which seemed to scowl defiance in death. An exclamation from Jake arrested the youths’ attention ; for they had turned away, fearing that the old man intended to scalp the Indian.</p>

<p>” Great Christopher Columbus ! ” cried the strange old fellow, ” ef that don’t beat all creation. I calls that a raal maracle now. Boyees, come hyur. Look at that skunk’s ugly face ; half his cheek ur off, an’ his nose laid open, ain’t it ? “</p>

<p>” Yes,” said Gaultier, who stooped to examine more attentively; “but it doesn’t look as if it was done to-night ; the injuries seem old.”</p>

<p>” That’s the very thing this child knows,” continued Jake. ” Hooraw! I’ve won the ‘bacca arter all. This is the very varmint that a’most took Bill Bucknall’s ha’r. Bill told me o’ the skunk’s head-mark. Ye-es; this is he sure as beaver medicine—hooraw!” and the old trapper woke the echoes with his wild yells. ” I’m a-gwine to take this coon’s top-knot, <i>I</i> am,” he continued. ” Come, old fellur ; you’ll never miss it. Thur’s no need o’ ha’r whur you’ve gone, I reckon.” He accordingly drew his bowie-knife, and twining his fingers in the long scalp-lock, he described a circle round it with the keen point of his knife, and inserting the weapon under the skin, with a quick pluck the trophy was taken, and secured to his belt. The boys looked on, partly shocked and partly amused at the wild language and proceedings of their companion.</p>

<p>Returning to the principal battle-ground, they took the arms of the savages, among which there were but two guns, old flint-lock smoothbores, which Jake threw away in great disgust. They retained the hatchets and knives, however, leaving the bows with the dead. Half an hour’s quick walking brought them to where they had left the canoe ; and taking out their provisions, they sat down in a sheltered spot among some rocks, and fought their battle over again while engaged with their meal.</p>

<p>The gray light of morning surprised them thus occupied; and as they intended to pass the day in that place to rest themselves, and dry their effects, which had been saturated by the rain, they stretched
themselves on the shingle, and notwithstanding their late excitement, and the uncomfortable nature of their couches, they soon fell fast asleep.</p>

<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>Next day I remembered I had a visit to make. The Comte de Charmilles expected me to call upon him before noon. I meant to go, of course; I had no wish to disappoint him! I was prepared for a stormy scene with him; I could already picture the haughty old aristocrat’s wounded pride and indignation at the dishonour brought on his name,—but I could not quite imagine what he would be likely to say. Certes, he could not excuse his daughter or her partner in iniquity; he might pour out his wrath upon me for making the affair public to all his friends and acquaintances, but that would be the utmost he could do. I determined to hear him out with the utmost patience and courtesy,—my quarrel was not with him,—he had never given me offence, save by his stupid Royalist tendencies and bigoted Catholicism,—and it was quite enough for me, a nineteenth century Republican, to have lowered his pride and broken it,—I wanted nothing more so far as <em>he</em> was concerned! Before starting on my ceremonious errand, I packed a  few clothes and other necessaries in my portmanteau ready for immediate departure from home, and this done, I went in search of my father. He was just preparing to leave the house for his usual duties at the Bank, and he looked fagged and wearied. He lifted his eyes and regarded me steadily as I approached him,—his lips quivered, and, suddenly laying his hand on my shoulder, he said—</p>
<p>“Gaston, it goes to my old heart to part with you!—for I love you! But something has embittered and crossed your once sweet and generous nature; and though I have thought about it anxiously all night, I have still come to the same conclusion,—namely, that it will be best for us both that we should separate for a time, especially under the unhappy circumstances that have just taken place. The whole position is too painful for everybody concerned! And I am quite ready to admit that the suffering you have personally undergone has been, and is, of a nature to chafe and exasperate your feelings. Change of scene and different surroundings will do much for you, <em>mon garçon</em>,—and, this miserable <em>esclandre</em> will possibly die out during your absence. Choose your own time for going⸺”</p>
<p>“I have chosen it”—I interrupted him quietly—“I shall leave you to-day.”</p>
<p>An expression of sharp pain contracted his fine old features for a moment,—then apparently rallying his self-possession, he returned—</p>
<p>“<em>Soit!</em> It is perhaps best! You will find a note from me in your desk in the library; I have thought it wisest to give you at once a round sum sufficient for present needs. Your share in the Bank as my partner naturally continues,—and shall be religiously set aside for your use on your return. I do not know whether you have any idea of a destination,—I should suggest your visiting England for a time.”</p>
<p>I smiled.</p>
<p>“Thanks! I am too truly French in my sympathies to care for the British climate. No!—if, like a new Cain, I am to be a vagabond on the face of the earth, I will wander as far as my fancy takes me; Africa, <em>par exemple</em>, presents boundless forests, where, if one chose, one could almost lose one’s very identity!”</p>
<p>My father’s eyes flashed a keen and sorrowful reproach into mine.</p>
<p>“<em>Mon fils</em>, why speak so bitterly? Is it necessary to add an extra pang to my grief?”</p>
<p> A sudden impulse moved me to softer emotion,—taking his hand I kissed it respectfully.</p>
<p>“<em>Mon père</em>, I regret beyond all words that I am unhappily the cause of any distress to you! We part;—and it is no doubt advisable, as you say, that we should do so,—for a time; but in bidding you farewell I will ask you to think of me at my best,—and to believe that there is no man in all the world whom I admire and honour more than yourself! Sentiment between men is ridiculous I know, but⸺” I kissed his hand once more, and I felt his fingers tremble as they clung for a moment to mine.</p>
<p>“God bless thee, Gaston!” he murmured. “And, stay!—let me have time to think again! Do not leave Paris yet—wait till to-morrow!”</p>
<p>I made a half sign of assent—but uttered no promise; and watched him with a curious forsaken feeling, as with a kindly yet wistful last look at me, he left the house and walked rapidly along on his usual way to business. Should I ever dwell with him again in the old frank familiarity of intercourse that had made us more like comrades than father and son? I doubted it! <em>My</em> life was changed,—<em>my</em> road lay down a dark side-turning; <em>his</em> continued fair and open, with the full sunshine of honour lighting it to the end!</p>
<p>Entering the library, I looked in my desk for the packet my father had mentioned, and found it,—a bulky envelope containing French notes to the amount of what would be about five hundred pounds in English money. I took possession of these,—and then wrote a note to my father, thanking him for his generosity, and bidding him farewell, while, to satisfy him as to my destination, I added that it was my immediate intention to visit Italy. A lie of course!—I had no such intention; I never meant to leave Paris, but of this hereafter. I then finished my packing and other preparations, and went out of the dear old house at Neuilly with scarce a regret,—not realizing, as I afterwards realized, that I should never, never enter it again! Hailing a passing carriage I bade the driver take me to the <em>Gare de l’Est</em>. Our man-servant Dunois, who put my portmanteau into the vehicle and watched my departure more or less curiously, heard me give this order, which was precisely what I wanted. I knew he would repeat it to my father, who by this means would receive the impression that I had carried out my written intention, and departed for Italy by the Lucerne and Chiasso route to Milan. Arrived at the <em>Gare</em>, I put my portmanteau in charge of the official to whom such baggage  is consigned for safe keeping—and then I leisurely proceeded to retrace my route on foot, till I reached the residence of the Comte de Charmilles. The very outside of the great house looked dreary; some of the blinds were down,—there was a deserted melancholy aspect about it that was doubly striking in comparison with the glitter and brilliancy that had surrounded it on the previous day. The maid who opened the door to me looked scared and miserable as though she had been up all night,—and, murmuring under her breath and with averted eyes that her master had been expecting me for some time, she showed me into the Count’s private study and announced me by name. The Count himself was sitting in his arm-chair, his back turned towards me,—his figure rigidly erect,—and he gave no sign of having heard my entrance.</p>
<p>The servant departed noiselessly, closing the door behind her,—and I stood irresolute, waiting for him to speak. But he uttered not a word. All at once my eyes lighted on a case of pistols open on the table,—from the position and appearance of the weapons, I saw they were loaded and ready for use. The situation flashed upon me in an instant, and I smiled with some contempt as I realized it. This foolish old man—this withering stump of ancient French chivalry,—had actually resolved to fight out the question of his daughter’s honour with me, face to face! Was ever such a mad scheme! What a Don Quixote of a father to be sure! If he had taken up arms for a stage mistress now,—if he had risen in eager defence of some coarse painted dancing woman, whose nearly nude body was on view to the public for so many francs per night, one would not have blamed him, or thought him ridiculous,—no, not in Paris! But to think of fighting a duel for merely a <em>daughter’s</em> reputation!—<em>Dieu!</em> it was a freak worthy of laughter! Yet there was a touch of the romantic and pathetic about it that moved me in spite of myself,—though of course I determined to refuse his challenge. I did not want to shed the blood of that old white-haired man! But suppose he still persisted? Well, then I must defend myself, and if I killed him, it would be unfortunate, but it could not be helped. The idea of <em>his</em> dispatching <em>me</em> never entered my head. There was something in <em>me</em>, or so I imagined, that could <em>not</em> be killed!—not yet!</p>
<p>Meanwhile the object of my musings remained immovably silent,— and I began rather to wonder at such obstinate taciturnity. His indomitable pride had met with a terrific fall, I reflected!—probably he found it difficult to begin the conversation. I advanced a little.</p>
<p> “M. de Charmilles! You bade me come to you, and I am here!”</p>
<p>He made no answer. His left hand, thin and wrinkled, rested on the carved oak arm of the chair, and I thought I saw it tremble ever so slightly. Was his rage so great that it had rendered him absolutely speechless? I moved a few steps nearer.</p>
<p>“M. de Charmilles!” I repeated, raising my voice a little—“I am here—Gaston Beauvais. Have you anything to say to me?”</p>
<p>No answer! A vague awe seized me, and instinctively hushing my footsteps, I approached and ventured to touch the fingers that were lightly closed round the arm of the chair,—they were warm, but they did not move,—only the diamond signet on the third finger glittered coldly like a wintry star.</p>
<p>“M. de Charmilles?” I said loudly once more; then, mastering the curious sensation of terror that held me momentarily inert and uncertain what to do I went resolutely forward and round, so that I could look him full in the face. As I did so I recoiled with an involuntary exclamation; the old man’s features were rigid and bloodless,—the eyes were wide open, fixed and glassy, though they appeared to stare at me with an expression of calm and freezing disdain,—the lips were parted in a stern smile,—and the fine white hair was slightly roughened about the forehead as though a hand had been lately pressed there to still some throbbing ache. A frozen figure of old-world dignity he sate, surveying me, or so it seemed, in speechless but majestic scorn; while I, for one amazed breathless moment stood confronting him, overpowered by the cold solemnity and grandeur of his aspect. Then—all suddenly—the set jaw dropped; the ghastly look of Death darkened the erstwhile tranquil countenance; and my awe gave way to the wildest nervous horror. Springing to the bell I rang it violently and incessantly; the servants flocked in, and in a few seconds the room was a scene of confusion and lamentation. As in a dream I saw the Comtesse de Charmilles feebly totter in and distractedly fall on her knees by her husband’s passive form; I saw Héloïse busying herself in chafing her uncle’s yet warm hands,—I heard the sound of convulsive sobbing;—and then I became dimly aware of a physician’s presence, and of the sudden hush of suspense following his arrival. A brief examination sufficed;—the words “Il est mort!” though uttered in the lowest whisper, reached the ears of the desolate Countess who, with a long shuddering wail of  agony, sank senseless at the dead man’s feet. It was all over!—some little vessel in the heart had snapt,—some little subtle chord in the brain had given way under the pressure of strong indignation, grief, and excitement,—and the proud old aristocrat had gone to that equalizing dust where there is neither pride nor shame! He was dead,—and some narrow-minded fools may consider, if they like, that <em>I</em> killed him. But how? What crime had <em>I</em> committed? None! I had merely made a stand for moral law in social life! My career was stainless, save for the green trail of the Absinthe-slime which no one saw. And Society never blames vice that does not publicly offend. Pauline was the sinner,—little, childlike, blue-eyed Pauline!—and I took a sort of grim and awful pleasure in regarding her as a <em>parricide</em>! Why, because she had a sweet face, a slim form and a bright smile, should she escape from the results of her own treachery and crime? I could not see it then,—and I cannot see it even now! No one can make <em>me</em> responsible for the old Count’s death,—no one I say!—though at times, his white, still, majestic face confronts me in the darkness with a speechless reproach and undying challenge. But I know it is only a phantasm!—and I quickly take refuge in the truth as declared by the fashionable world of Paris when his death became generally known,—namely, that his daughter’s dishonour (not my proclamation of it, observe!) had broken his heart;—and that even so, broken-hearted for her sake, he died!</p>

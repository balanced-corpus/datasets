<!--Chapter title: CHAPTER VIII<br>THE CONFESSION OF JUDITH TRAVERS,<br>OTHERWISE CONSTANCE GARDNER-->
<p>“If you think the exhibition of my heart will help you to read your own; if you think the confession of my secret and blighted life will be a warning to you; if you feel that my present holy rest will encourage your own spiritual aspirations; why, then, sweet companion of the cloister, listen!</p>

<p>“Orphaned in infancy, I was left to the care of an old woman who made a slave of me. She was superstitious, kept body and soul together mostly by narcotics, was reputed to be a witch, and was of a truth a cruel woman. She ill-treated me, and I bore it until I was almost verging on womanhood; though at sixteen I was as innocent and unsophisticated as a child of ten.</p>

<p>“Once when she had beaten me with more than usual severity I resolved that I would run away. A theatrical manager had induced the old woman to let me appear as an angel in the play of Faust at the local theatre. Soon afterwards a company of strolling players passed through the town. I followed them. In the darkness of that cruel time I can still see one sympathetic face looking at me with tearful eyes. I can still hear one gentle tender voice say ‘good bye!’</p>

<p>“His name was Horace Durand. He was a boy, many years younger than I, and more highly placed in the little town where I was born. He had a happy home, a father and mother of great respectability, a future full of peaceful promise. He was not a play- mate, but I had spoken to him, and for years I carried him in my sweetest recollections.</p>

<p>“By tortuous paths and devious ways I reached London. With some little experience gained under the canvass of a travelling company of players, and after an illness in a strange lodging where they had left me to die, I began my career as an actress in a famous London theatre. My salary was fifteen shillings a week. I lived at Holloway, and, when I had paid the rent of my room and an occasional omnibus fare, I had nine shillings left for food and clothing. Now and then I had to suffer the pangs of hunger to save myself from the equally bitter pains of cold. I learned in those days how little we require. Warmth and food represented to me happiness. Would to heaven I had never desired more than these mere necessaries of life! If I had been a great artist, the consciousness of power, the belief in a future of ambitious success might have saved me. But the capacity to feel grand ideas and to sympathise with noble sentiments—these gifts of nature slumbered so long in my poor soul, that, when the one grand passion of all came to awaken the rest, it was too late, too late!</p>

<p>“That night I am going to tell you of a ‘lady of the ballet’ was sent to dress in my room. I had an apartment all to myself because it was so small that it was deemed impossible for two persons to use it at the same time. But my friend of the ballet was, for some reason connected with the re-building of the theatre, put into my cell. When I saw her fine underclothing, her silk hose, the lace on her petticoat, her satin corset, I was ashamed to make my toilet in her presence. She noticed it, and was so frank and generous that I liked her at once. ‘You are ashamed of your clothes,’ she said; ‘you need not be.’ I remember her exact words. ‘You are a far prettier girl than I, and it is your own fault if you do not dress better than I do.’ She took me by the shoulders and looked into my face. ‘And positively you look hungry; you don’t get enough to eat!’ The tears came into my eyes. ‘What do they pay you a week?’ I told her. ‘And you are trying to live upon that?’ she asked. I said I did live upon it ‘Why, my poor child,’ she replied, ‘you are committing suicide! Have you a mother?’ ‘No.’ ‘Nor a father?’ ‘No.’ ‘A sweetheart?’ ‘No.’ ‘Then, why do you consent to starve? When I was your age I struggled for a whole month against poverty for the sake of my father and mother and the honour of their name. You are without an excuse.’ Understanding from what she said that she was rich, I asked her what salary she received at the theatre. ‘Nothing!’ she said; ‘nothing, and find myself! And yet I have the prettiest <i>bijou</i> brougham in town, a lovely house, half-a-dozen servants, and drink ‘fizz’ every day at luncheon!’ I listened to her with wonder, with the kind of fascination we have in contemplating the graceful movements of a serpent or a tiger. She clasped a string of diamonds round my neck, and bade me look into the mirror on the wall. How they flashed! Between the acts a messenger brought into the little room a hot dish of sweetbread and a small bottle of wine. I had bought a pair of second-hand boots at a pawnshop that day, in consequence of which extravagance I had been obliged to dine upon a penny roll. I was very hungry. If the ballet-woman had not invited me to eat, I think I must have begged for a mouthful.</p>

<p>“She insisted upon taking me home in her brougham. There was a bitter east wind. Poverty had never seemed so ugly to me as on that night. My landlady took the opportunity of abusing me the next day, for I owed her a fortnight’s rent. ‘Come gadding home in a swell’s brougham, a disgracing my house!’ she said, ‘and then not pay my rent; if I <i>am</i> to have a fine madam of your sort in my house, at least let me be paid for the disgrace of it!’ I went out and pawned all I had in the world and paid her. There is no stronger hand to drag a woman down to hell than a pawn-ticket, unless it is to be virtuous and to be discredited even when you are starving for honesty’s sake. And oh, the cruel unfeeling city that bows and makes way for Vice in diamonds and tramples on Virtue in rags!</p>

<p>“The day came when a brougham waited at the stage-door for <i>me</i>; when <i>I</i> wore diamonds, and no longer went shivering to my rooms, cold and hungry. My pictures were bought by gentle, unsophisticated persons in country towns to adorn artistic albums. I had a house in Mayfair. I drove in the Park. My pair of ponies were famous. Ah! dear friend, turn away your head! Yes, take away your hand! I was toasted of men and envied of women. They hung my brazen face among pure and noble ladies on the Academy walls. That theatre in which I had dressed night after night to appear six or seven times and only to speak once; that theatre in which the acting manager used to swear at me if I was half an hour late; that theatre in which the manager insulted me when he first engaged me; that house of infamy where I had tried to earn an honest living became my own. It lighted all its lamps for me; it spread all its softest carpets for my feet; behind the scenes artists high and low exercised their profoundest courtesies to please me. In front the audience flung its bouquets to me. Not that I was a great artist. I was not. Quite the contrary. But the leading artists of the Academy designed my dresses. The most famous French <i>modistes</i> made them. Fine ladies came to study the fashions at my theatre. Aesthetic artists sat in the stalls to gloat over the lissome graces of a woman’s figure! Yes, sigh my poor friend, and regret you ever desired to know my story. Sit apart and cover your chaste eyes!</p>
    
<p>“Nay, pity the poor moth with its gold and crimson wings fluttering in the flashing lights of London! Ah! but you will pity me soon, my sister, and take me back into your arms again.</p>

<p>“An epidemic of fever fell upon the wealthy quarter of the town. It struck me through my barricades of gold. But all the medical skill of Vanity Fair bent itself to my rescue. I was nursed by Sisters of Mercy, and found solace in the administrations of a priest of our Holy Church. When I was well enough I went abroad. On the dreamy shores of Lago-Maggiore I found myself apart from the world. Perfect rest was the prescription I had to carry out. Nobody must know of my retreat. I lived <i>incognito</i>, my name a new one; aye and my life a new one. I met him accidentally. I have told you his name. When I am dead it may be found engraven on my heart, for all my prayers, my vigils, my fasts, my penances will not obliterate it! Young, enthusiastic, a student, educated to love the noble and the true, to hate the false, the vulgar, and the mean. A face open as the day, an ambition of the loftiest, I loved him. For the first time I felt the passion I had toyed with; for the first time I could declaim the poet’s lines that had fallen, with a hollow ring from a hollow heart, before audiences who had been content with the mockery because the mocker was tricked out in artistic robes, in a sensuous atmosphere of art and music. For the first time I understood Marguerite’s woes and Ophelia’s tender words. For the first time my heart seemed to go out to the noble and the pure, the beautiful and the true, and I had tears instead of laughter for hearts that broke with love. Listen, sister, now, and pity me! I learnt to pray then. It was the inspiration of his deep, true eyes that raised my thoughts to heaven, that lifted my soul from the world’s gutter, that showed me the hideous moth, its wings ragged and torn.</p>

<p>“Had I courage to let him see the creature I was? No. I had only just begun to live. His presence thrilled me. I hung upon the music of his voice. I wept for very joy. He often questioned me about the sadness he traced in my eyes. Now and then he talked of Paris and once of London. I mentioned to him the name of a French artist whose reputation was not good in the estimation of righteous people. He had never seen that vile woman he said, and he hoped he never might. He had not been in London since he was a boy. When he left me that day I tried to think I, too, knew not that other woman, my other self; but conscience gripped my heart, and showed me myself. I prayed that it might turn out a dream; I flung myself on my face and lay prone for hours, praying that I might wake and find life just beginning, there and then, under the soft Italian skies, with Horace Durand, in the path that true love strews with flowers.</p>

<p>“I bent Fate to my own strong will. It seemed as if heaven itself had made a compromise with me—my love was so absorbing a passion, a blissfulness so all engrossing, pure to me and him as the limpid streams that trickled down the mountains in whose grateful shadows we sat letting the days slip by. And it came to pass that I did indeed forget myself, and who I was, and what I had been; it came to pass that I remembered nothing but that I loved and was beloved; and it must have been that some latent purity of thought and hope and faith that belonged to my childhood looked up at him out of my false eyes, or he could never have poured out his very soul into my ears, and pictured me his wife, the partner of his joys and sorrows. After long days of sun and sweet perfumes, when the earth has lain in the arms of the hot and wooing sun, there come storm and tempest.</p>

<p>“It had been a bitterness in my cup of joy to learn that he had forgotten the poor little Constance of his boyish days, who now hung upon the honey of his lips; for I had remembered him the first hour I saw him as a man, and had experienced a new joy in recalling his childish tears, and his regretful good-bye in the hay-meadows by the green lane of the English valley far away. The shadow of the tempest fell upon my Italian dream in the shape of a visitor from London, who knew Horace and was his uncle’s intimate friend. A hard just man, who blotted out my dream, laid waste my blissful hopes, devastated the harvest of a sweet summer, and left me once more a waif and stray of the world. O sister, touch me now! Let me feel your arm around me! One moment let me lay my head upon your shoulder!</p>

<p>“‘Judith Travers,’ said the just man, ‘this Horace Durand is the nephew of one who saved my life and honour; this Horace Durand is the hope and joy of my friend’s declining years; I am here to break off his association with you. He does not know you; he thinks you a saint; when he learns who you are he will loathe you.’ He was a just man but cruel; he addressed me as a judge might from his high seat; and he spoke this sentence against me. ‘This,’ he said, ‘is what will happen should you resist my appeal to give him back to those who are his friends, and to the old man who is en- titled to his respect and obedience. To-morrow, fortified with full details of your career, he shall stand before you and say, ‘There is a man at Baveno who declares that he has an interest in the Regent Theatre; that he is here to take you back to London; that you are——’ </p>

<p>“I heard no more. As he spoke I seemed to see my love standing before me with pale face and flashing eyes. I fell before the cruel sentence as one dead, and when I awoke expected to find myself in purgatory. But Fridoline was by my side and Father Gabriello. They gave me restoratives; the dear father fortified me with wise advice; and I knew that my days in the world were over. ‘Let us begone,’ I said, ‘I am content. It is enough that my soul has passed through the sweet pastures of a pure love; it is better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.’ And it entered into my heart to feel that I was Constance Gardner once more, saying a good- bye again, in the which I found a new solace. Hush! Do you not hear those sweet sounds? They are other harps than Fridoline’s, poor dear! I did not think to go before her, for she is old and I am young. Kiss me, sweet sister! Your chaste lips will find no Judith here, but only the persecuted maiden by the Scarsdale river, who has found her everlasting rest in the loving arms of Mary.” </p>

<p>And so passed away one, who, under more fortunate circumstances, might have been an angel upon earth, as well as an angel in heaven.</p>

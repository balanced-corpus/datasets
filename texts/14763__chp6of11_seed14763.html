<title>Chapter 6 of The Gods give my Donkey Wings by Angus Evan Abbott</title>

<p>
Long before we reached the Thorp the 
people met us, coming at a great rate along the goat-path bordering the stream, 
and shouting to us as we came in sight. The news spread rapidly; and when I passed 
along the street to the house of my kind host,—for I was wet to the skin and shivering 
with cold,—I found in front of every house the little drab god of Sorrow, hands
to face and hair hanging dishevelled, and the goats home from the Mountain gingerly
threaded their way between the clay figures. By the time I had made the necessary 
change of garments, and had taken a good swig of the mulled brew which the kind 
hostess had prepared for me,—schooled in the way of women, I had taken occasion to 
place upon her head a cap, a cheap thing but jaunty, and it made the good-wife
woundrously kind,—I took my place on the bench to watch the evening sun set fire to 
the ice and snow on the Mountain. As I gazed at the towering height, I could not but 
think of the enormous mass of earth and ice and rock, full of roaring waters, sullen lakes,
bats and blackness, and away inside the little spark of animated clay, the puny
headstrong thing called man, who, wrapping his petty dignities, troubles, joys, and hopes 
about him, had hurried under the immortal hills to spite his fellow gnats. And they, 
angry little gnats, how they had bravely buzzed after him until they had come upon 
a bit of clay moulded somewhat after their own image, somewhat afteer the shape that 
had been most familiar to them since their eyes first learned to know the smiles of 
their mothers, and, knowing the shape and substance of it, they allowed it to 
frighten them out of their common sense. They had fled, frightened at a daub of 
clay. The quarrel, I realised, lay between mind and matter, and the mind was in the Mountain.

<p>
Thinking on small things, my thoughts naturally enough turned to the little lady 
with the clear eyes and black hair who had given me such a roguish nod of recognition 
in the morning. She was chirp enough and laughing before the people; would her 
buoyancy continue in the privacy of her own house? Would not the knowledge
that her sweetheart,—for a sweetheart I had no doubt he must be,—that he was alone in 
the Mountain, cause her woman soul to fear and make miserable her little heart? Maybe 
at this very moment her hands were covering those sparkling eyes of hers, and the 
tears trickling through. The thought made me uncomfortable, and, after fidgeting about 
for a time and trying to settle myself to my brew, I gave the job up as a bad one, and resolved 
to walk over to the house in which she lived,—I had not gone through the Thorp 
with my eyes shut,—and see what was happening to her. So, taking a bit of lace 
in my pocket,—for young wenches are fond of lace,—I made my way across the street,
and, pulling the latch-string, stepped into the 
entry. Now it is a ticklish thing this walking unannounced into the abode of a pretty 
lass who lives alone, and, having reached the age when a man can bide his time, and can 
afford to show some consideration to the women-folk, which no fiery young spark 
will do, I stood in the outer room for a spell of time long enough to allow the lass 
to give her dress a bit pull here and a ruffle and shake there, and to cast one glance 
at her neck-gear, of which maidens in all climes, I know right well, are more than 
ordinary suspicious. I was confident the grace thus given her could not have been ill 
received, for I heard her dainty feet running nimbly about putting things to rights. 
When the footsteps ceased, I entered, and found her sitting there demurely composed,—
well, the gods fly away with my donkey if I could do anything but admire the art of the 
lady. The wench sat before a tapestry assiduously plying her needle at a border, 
and she looked over her shoulder at me as though she had only just heard me enter. 
Her black hair was coiled loosely, and the end of the strand stuck coquettishly over her 
ear in quite a ridiculous way. Her kerchief was knotted about her neck, and the great 
apron she wore fitted her like a charm. When she looked at me her eyes sparkled 
with the liquid brilliancy of diamonds, and her cheeks were aglow with rosy colour, for 
it is invariably the black-haired witch that has the brightest cheeks. She arose as I 
entered, and curtsied, a sedate, tricky little genuflection, addressing me in a gentle tone, 
although, mind you, as like as not it was some impudent remark she made to me, for 
I will not trust a woman who is aware that one does not know what she is saying,—or, 
worse still, doing. But, in charity, giving her credit for the best, I returned a greeting 
in my own tongue, and, drawing up a stool, I sat down opposite her.
</p>
<p>
There was a twinkle in her eye as she turned to ply the needle, and in a little while her under 
lip began to tremble out of very devilment, I know; and I could see that at times her sides 
shook under the merriment which she was trying to keep from bursting out upon her 
lips. To be sure, the situation was a whit comical. I could not speak to her nor she to me, 
but the little minx should not have been thinking of that. She, there in comfort, tittering and 
bright, and her lover buried in the heart of a mountain, in darkness, dankness, dreariness, and maybe
dismay, making his bed among the lava of an ancient volcano. Had I been a maiden 
with such a strapping lad courting me, egad! I’d have been in a state. But I aver, as I 
sat there looking at her and speculating as only an honest packman can, she, the body, 
threw her dainty white hands into the air and burst into a peal of laughter, so long 
continued, that, although I was laughing myself, I began to fear for the safety of her ribs. 
And she had no sooner dried her eyes and taken one squint at me than the fit was 
upon her again, and she clasped her hands over her face and rocked herself in the chair 
forward and back, while I sat there with my palms one clapped on top of each knee, and, 
like the old fool that I am, I joined with her til my lungs were sore. It was some time 
before we came to our senses, and then the witch seemed concerned lest I should take 
my welcome as being inhospitable, and she brought me as fine a reaming swig as I ever 
clapped lips to. Faith, she knew good liquor, which is not a virtue a man of experience 
expects of a woman. The god of the Contraries created woman, and has looked after her ever since. 
There sat I and drank the brew and smacked my lips, and watched the lass; but for the life of me 
I could not discern the smallest trace of distress in her face, nor, where it is still more 
likely to discover itself, in her movements, for woman can keep a cheery face when her 
heart is the sorest, and even when hope is gone. No, the little lady was merry enough, 
and yet I could not believe she had a callous heart. Maybe it was her bravery, or maybe 
she knew something that others did not; for instance, that The Maker of Gods had prepared a 
comfortable home for himself on the shores of the silent lake; that he had made 
many journeys to the spot, taking with him on each occasion necessities and even comforts. 
So I took the bit lace from my pocket, a pretty pattern it was, that had been 
given me to induce me to buy, and so cost me nothing but the carrying, and, presenting 
it to the lass, took my departure when the joy was upon her. It is the way I have to 
ensure a warm welcome when I again return. My curiosity was increased rather than allayed 
by the visit. All that I knew definitely was that The Father had something 
that The Maker of Gods coveted, and <em>vice versâ;</em> that the expedition against the young 
man had failed; that the Thorp was in a hubbub, and the young man’s lass was cock-a-hoop. 
Not enough this to satisfy a packman.
</p>
<p>
Next morning, after I had broken my fast, my host beckoned me to come with him, and, 
issuing forth into the open air, we made our way towards the house of The Father. Reaching 
this, we found a knot of men and women surrounding the doorsteps expectantly waiting, 
and among other familiar faces, and standing well apart as was her habit, I saw my little Lady 
of the Raven Locks. We had not long been in our positions before the door of the house opened, and forth 
stepped The Father, surrounded by his thirteen Councillors. The Father held in his hand 
a scroll, and this he proceeded to read to the assemblage. Having thoroughly mastered 
my vocabulary, I caught the drift of the document to be a demand for the instant return 
to the confines of the Thorp of The Maker of Gods, ending with a dignified threat of future pains 
and penalties should the sulky craftsman not comply with the strong request. 
Those around me seemed to look upon it as a weighty document, but little the people 
know about the working of the brain of one whose days are spent in creating the beauties 
of life. When The Father had done with his reading, the parchment was placed with great care inside a 
round gourd-like box, painted a brilliant red, and tightly bound with wire, and this 
was handed to my host, who, again beckoning me to follow, made off towards the Mountain. 
I asked him whither he was bound, and, making out the words and signs that he 
intended to journey round the base of the Mountain, I went to where my ass was 
tethered, and, mounting the drab brute,—for my host swung a strapping stride,—I so 
accompanied him. It was a weary journey on the ambling beast, picking our way among rocks and dangerous 
goat-paths; but at last, when we had made as near as I could judge an eighth of the 
circumference of the extinct volcano, we came to a brawling mountain-stream that 
poured down from the snows. This, I found, fell through a fissure in the rock. Stopping here, 
my guide took the box in his hand and dropped it into the aperture, and, by pointing 
out the hold and then towards the centre of the Mountain, led me to understand that the 
message would float to the Yellow Lake, on the shores of which the truant was encamped, 
and that its glaring red tints in the dark waters were to attract the young man’s eyes. 
I afterwards found that the people had stretched a net across the stream at a point 
near to the Thorp, so that no message which The Maker of Gods might return could 
float down the stream unnoticed.
</p>
<p>
Sure enough, on the following morning an answer from the Man in the Mountain had 
arrived, and was found caught in the meshes of the net. There was no mistaking the 
tenor of the message. The Father read it to the people, and it turned out to be 
resolute and defiant. Workmen had been all the morning busily engaged in erecting 
the framework of something that looked to be a triumphal arch, and these, when they 
heard the contents of the missive, appealed to The Father to say whether or no they were to 
proceed with their work. After a consultaion with his Elders, The Father told 
them to go on, and they returned with the unwillingness that men display when they fear 
their labours will be in vain. Surely they were not erecting an arch to celebrate the 
return of their craftsman! That would be absurd. It would be nothing more than an 
encouragement to him to again take the huff, and retire into the earth. Yet I could 
come by no other explanation, cudgel my brains as I might; and although sorely put to it, 
I refrained from appearing too inquisitive, for people despise an inquisitive guest.

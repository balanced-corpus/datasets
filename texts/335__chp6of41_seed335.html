<p>“Fowle jealousy! that turnest love divine<br>
To joyless dread, and mak’st the longing heart<br> 
With hateful thoughts to languish and to pine, <br>
And feed itself with self-consuming smart, <br>
Of all the passions in the mind thou vilest art.” <br>
Spenser.</p></div>

<p>When Harriett was going, to the astonishment of all, Mr. Langley got his hat and offered to see her home; neither Mrs. Gresham, Harriett, nor Ethel had deemed him so gallant. Harriett said there was no necessity for him to come, as she was accustomed to walk alone after dark, but, as he pressed the point, she acceded, rather pleased to have a <em>tête-à-tête</em> with Justin’s friend. When they started, she was struck to see how he towered above her. To her surprise, he offered her his arm, for she had regarded him as a very shy young man, and was naturally amazed at his matter-of-course air in performing this act of politeness. She had expected he would drag along by her side and say nothing. Her astonishment was again excited when, after taking his arm, he bent his head towards her so as to see her face, and inquired, in measured accents:</p>

<p>“So you are Harriett Mayne—the vicar’s elder sister?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Are you surprised at his friendship for me?”</p>
  
<p>“Nay.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I can say, so you are Martin Langley—Justin’s great friend?”</p>

<p>“And <em>you are</em> surprised at his choosing me.”</p>

<p>“I! why should I be?”</p>

<p>“Ah! do not deny it. I observed it at your first glance, when I entered the room. It said, as plainly as looks could say,’What a lout!’”</p>

<p>Harriett laughed and contradicted him, although she thought to herself: “He has more discernment than I gave him credit for.”</p>

<p>After a minute’s silence, she said: “I admire you for your frankness. Do you think you will like Maxwell?—what you have seen of its people?”</p>

<p>“Yes, well enough. I can make myself contented anywhere; besides, Mr. and Mrs. Gresham make it quite like a home for me. I think Miss Gresham said you had a letter from Justin,—may I ask the news it contains?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I would show it to you, with pleasure, but that he requested me not even to let Ethel see it. He complains of being rather out of health and spirits, and I think he fears it coming to his mother’s ears; she is so very anxious.”</p>

<p>“I am surprised at <em>his</em> being low-spirited. Something must be the matter. Did he say he should be coming home soon?”</p>

<p>“He said he might shortly run down for a day or two.”</p>

<p>Then they both relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>They were now passing through the one long street of which the principal part of the town was comprised. It was a sultry, oppressive evening, with dark clouds obscuring the moon; there was little light, save from the shop-windows, gas being but a recent addition to Maxwell, lighted only on winter nights. The people were standing at their doors, glad to get a little air; the men smoking, and the women, with their aprons over their heads, chatting in groups together.</p>

<p>Harriett and Langley passed down the High Street, and came in sight of a large, new public-house. It stood out into the street, and threw the glare of its many lights far before it. It was a new importation to Maxwell, and a great eye-sore to Mr. Mayne; for he found the attractions of its brilliant bar, green and gold walls, spruce barmaid, and music-hall, had lured many a respectable, home-staying man to spend time and money there; curiosity drew them first, and, having once gone, they found so many diversions that they went again and often.</p>

<p>There had been nothing like it before in Maxwell. There had only been the old-fashioned public-houses and beer-shops, meagre and dirty enough, where the people went for their beer; and the one grand hotel, “The George,” where the farmers dined on market-days, and met once a fortnight to discuss crops, cattle, prices, and politics, over their ale and grog. The Maxwellians were not proof against this gaudy gin-palace; and, to the sorrow or disgust of the clergyman, the doctor, and the more respectable tradesmen, it flourished abundantly, and seemed likely to be a fixture in the town.</p>

<p>When Langley and Harriett came near this house, they saw a large crowd in the street, and heard shouts and screams; they hastened forward with one accord.</p>

<p>“What is this?” asked Harriett, of some of the outsiders of the crowd.</p>

<p>“Sure, it’s a fight, Miss Mayne,” respectfully replied a rough-looking labourer, who knew her.</p>

<p>“What is it about? Are they drunk?”</p>

<p>“One wor, I should say; but lor, miss, you can’t do no good; you’d better go away; they must fight it out.”</p>

<p>But Harriett had no such intention. She turned to Langley, who had been also making inquiries. “What shall we do, Mr. Langley?”</p>

<p>“Stop it, if we can.” And Langley elbowed his way through the crowd. Harriett followed close, holding with one hand to his arm. The people fell back a little as they recognized the parson’s sister, whom nearly everyone knew and nearly all respected. Still, it was a rough scene, and Langley turned once and expostulated with Harriett. “Really, you had better not come, I think.”</p>

<p>“Never mind me; I have no fear, and I may do some good,” she replied, firmly.</p>

<p>In the centre of the crowd a clear space was kept, in which two men were fighting desperately. The observers, both men and women, stood round, enjoying the sport, the men with their hands in their pockets, puffing at their pipes, the women with aprons over their heads, gesticulating and crying at intervals. One woman had thrown herself on the ground, moaning; she was the wife of one of the combatants; as Langley and Harriett came near her, she raised her head, and, recognizing the latter, clung to her gown, crying:</p>

<p>“Oh, sure, they’re killing of my own husband! Och! dear angel, save him, for it’s my own wicked fault.”</p>

<p>“Is it you, Mary Burrows ?” exclaimed Harriett, with severity; but she extended a hand to the woman, and raised her to her feet. Just then, one of the combatants was felled to the ground, and the conqueror was about to strike a finishing blow, when the wife, with an Irish howl, flung herself between them: “Sure, you shall kill me first!”</p>

<p>Harriett, too, came between them, but the man, enraged by drink and fighting, had no sense left. “Move out of the way, or I’ll serve you out too,” he cried, with a brutal oath. Harriett did not stir; she was quite fearless; she only shivered at his profane words. His hand was raised, when, with a well-planted blow from his powerful arm, Langley felled the man to the ground, saying, “I’ll teach you, you cowardly brute, how to insult a lady.”</p>

<p>The crowd applauded—crowds always applaud chivalry, especially when it is successful.</p>

<p>“Take that fellow away, some of you,” said Langley, authoritatively, pointing to the fallen hero, and he was obeyed, as a man with a strong will and powerful arm generally is. But some of them felt inclined to resent this interruption to their amusement.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” was whispered curiously among the crowd.</p>

<p>“Why, the new doctor, to be sure.”</p>

<p>“Then we’d better be civil, or he’ll poison us all,” suggested a wag. The joke spread, and laughter with it, and the crowd was soon restored to good-humour.</p>

<p>In the meantime Langley was attending the injured man, who lay unconscious on the ground, with blood-stained hands and face. His wife only moaned and cried in the most unsatisfactory manner, bitterly denouncing herself as the cause of the quarrel and fight.</p>

<p>After a time, Langley obtained sufficient order to get him carried to his home, Harriett and Mary Burrows following, with a few officious, bewailing neighbours, who had already discussed the probable widowhood and wake.</p>

<p>Their abode was a little way out of the town, on the road to Talbot Hall; it was a ruinous house, once of some size and importance, but the roof had fallen in, and the windows had fallen out. They entered at the shattered doorway; all was darkness save where the moon shone in through a broken casement, and revealed a barn-like room, with bare walls and floor.</p>

<p>As they were going in, Mary Burrows roused herself a little, and turning to Harriett, said:</p>

<p>“Sure and you’d better not come in, miss, for the two childer has got the fever.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Mary.” And Harriett followed her in. “But how came you to leave them, if they are ill?”</p>

<p>The woman only shook her head, and turned from Harriett to strike a light. The bed was occupied by the two sick children, so there was nothing for it but to lay the man on the floor. Langley felt his pulse, loosened his clothes, and pronounced there was no danger. He would come round in a few minutes, then he went to the restless, wailing children in the bed. This seemed a more alarming case, for he looked very serious, and called Harriett to his side.</p>

<p>“This is very wretched, Miss Mayne. How is it word was not sent to us of this case? It ought to have been attended to before.”</p>

<p>“Why, the woman is a Catholic, and will not seek help from any of us. The husband used to be a decent man, but lately they have seemed to go all wrong. I have come to see them once or twice, but she has been so sullen and ungrateful that it has driven me away.”</p>

<p>“Something must be done for these poor children.”</p>

<p>Langley directed one of the men, who had carried Burrows in, to go to Mr. Gresham with a slip of paper and fetch certain medicines.</p>

<p>Harriett went over and spoke to Mary, who sat on the floor with her husband’s head in her lap. Her long black hair had fallen loose on her shoulders, and formed a half veil to the wild, beautiful face that was raised to the clergyman’s daughter; the dark eyes were streaming with tears, the full red lips parted, and the bronzed cheek pale from agitation. “What a contrast was the child of tempestuous passions, and, it was to be feared, of sin, to the pure, stately maiden who stood before her, stooping from her height of knowledge and goodness, striving to raise this ignorant, wilful being by compassion and tenderness to the level of their common womanhood!</p>

<p>She was relating in broken sentences, and with many sobs, the cause of the riot. It appeared that she had not agreed well with her husband lately; he had been morose and cruel, and taken to drink, and to be late home at night; the cause, she supposed, was that an old lover of hers, named O’Connell, had lately returned to Maxwell from the gold diggings; he had realized a considerable fortune, and had been much disappointed to find her married. He was squandering his money recklessly, treating all his old comrades, and once or twice had treated her—bought her a smart shawl. That evening she was on her way to the chemist’s to procure some medicine for her sick children when she encountered O’Connell, who persuaded her to go into the public-house and take something to drink. Burrows happened to come in for his evening’s beer, and had found her with his rival. He reproached her in no very measured language, and she, infuriated at his suspicions, had, with the taunting tongue of woman, remarked it had been far better for her if she had married O’Connell —he would never have treated her thus. At this, Burrows raised his hand to strike her; O’Connell interfered, and they adjourned to the street to have it out.</p>

<p>When she arrived at this part of her narration, her husband’s eyes slowly opened, and on recognizing her, he endeavoured to raise his head, and move from her encircling arms.</p>

<p>“Oh! you wouldn’t go away from your own wife!” she cried.</p>

<p>“You’re a fine wife, you are,” muttered the man.</p>

<p>“Ye hear him, Miss Mayne,” she began, in a shrill tone; when Harriett, seeing that she was winding herself up for a burst of fiery eloquence, quickly interposed, and laying her hand on the woman’s shoulder, and drawing her on one side, whispered:</p>

<p>“Say no more, Mary. Take my advice, and ask him to forgive you.”</p>

“Forgive <em>me</em>. Why, he’s the one as ought to ask for forgiveness.”

<p>“Yes, I know that, Mary. He has been very wrong, but you have been very foolish. Your conduct was enough to provoke his jealousy. He will never be the first to make it up—it is not likely; and there is no knowing how easily you may make matters all right by two little words, ‘Forgive me,’ and then kiss him.”</p>

<p>Harriett went over to Langley’s side, and the wife stooped over her husband.</p>

<!-- CHAPTER I.<br>THE GRANGE. -->
<p>
About two or three miles from the thriving little port and town of Billmouth, on the coast of one of our western counties, there is a dwelling which rarely fails to attract the attention and appeal to the imagination of any stranger to the locality who may chance to pass that way. And there are many strangers who do so. For the walk by the coast from Billmouth to Garstang, and thence returning through the Artingale woods to the town, is a very pretty and pleasant one; and Garstang Grange is a sort of lion, which the Billmouth folk, and even people from the somewhat more distant town of Billiford, a few miles inland to the southward, take visitors to see.

Houses have physiognomies quite as distinctive and suggestive as those of the human beings whose idiosyncrasies they express in stone, and brick, and mortar. There are many, — the great majority, of course, — whose physiognomies express nothing. Their builders had no character to express in them. Of course, houses built by those whose trade it is to build them for other people — for any people who will pay the rent of them — belong to the category. And, generally speaking, new houses have less of character in their expression than old ones. It seems as if human beings by mere long living in a house can in some mysterious way impart to it a portion, or a reflection, of their own idiosyncrasy.

This, at least, was the case with Garstang Grange. It was a very expressive house. Everybody agreed in admitting that they were thus impressed by it. And yet it was difficult to say what the precise character of its expression was, or by what specialties of construction it produced the impression it did. 
</p>
<p>
It was certainly not a cheerful-looking house; and there could be no difference of opinion as to the fact that the effect it produced on the imagination was one of sadness and melancholy. An air of dilapidation will have this effect. But it was not that in the case of Garstang Grange. The old stone-built house was in perfect repair and good condition. The colour of the material of which it was built was sober and venerable, but could hardly be said to be sad. It was that picturesque, warm, stone-colour, between yellow and grey, which harmonises so well with the green of turf or foliage, and which becomes glowingly golden in the slanting rays of the rising or setting sun. Yet it was decidedly a grim-looking house. Of foliage there was little or none near it. And the difference of colour between that side of it which faced the sea, and the opposite side which looked landwards and southwards, spoke plainly enough of the unmitigated sweep of the brine-laden winds that blew over it from the seaward. It could be seen at a glancand, indeed, massive building; and must have been specially so, even at a time when houses were not built to last with scientific precision the duration of the builder’s lease of the ground.

It consisted of two wings, joined together by a very short connecting limb of the building, in such sort that the ground-floor resembled, in some degree, the form of the letter H. Both the wings terminated in high and steep gables; and the roof of the middle, or connecting portion, projected so as to form very large eaves. The building consisted of a ground-floor and one upper storey; and the rooms of both were low. And in the whole of the principal front — that which looked seaward — there were but six very moderatesized windows, one in each gable upstairs, and one in each gable on the ground-floor; and one in the central portion upstairs, and one over the deep and low porch which protected the door of entrance. The six rather large but gloomy rooms lighted by these six windows occupied about half the space contained in the house, which was thus by no means a very small one. At the back or landward side of the building, the whole of the space occupied by the centre rooms above and below the front side was devoted to a huge staircase. The house thus consisted of ten very good-sized rooms, besides the kitchen and some other dependencies which occupied an additional and, probably, subsequently built out-house or lean-to at the back.

The farm-houses of the period, when Garstang Grange was built, were not often constructed so substantially that many specimens of their class have been preserved to our day. Of the houses of the yeomanry a few as good as Garstang Grange may be met with, chiefly in the northern counties; but they are rare there, and rarer still in the southern half of the kingdom.

Nevertheless, Garstang Grange was, and had doubtless been built as, the home of a very perfect specimen of that class. The Garstangs of Garstang Grange were still owners as well as tillers of the soil. It is probable that when the Grange was built they owned more land than remained to them at the date of the events which the following pages are to record. But the land must have passed from them very many years ago. The few acres which still gave to the name of Garstang its place among the landowners of England were very few, and as poor in quality as in quantity. However, Garstang was Garstang of Garstang yet, and the name sounded well, and its owners were not less proud of it than the scions of the noblest lineages in the land of their ancestral titles and ancestral lands. Indeed, the unfailing tradition of the country-side attributed a very high antiquity to the origin of the family, and of its status in that part of the county of Sillshire. Common fame declared that Garstangs had been Garstangs of Garstang before the patrician Artingales had ever been heard of in the land, and even before the Farlands — another family of the neighbourhood, who laid claim to ante-Norman blood and settlement — had been known. And the remarkable circumstance that the name of the hundred is also Garstang would seem to give some degree of probability to the <em>vow populi</em> on this point. There is now neither town nor village of the name. It survives only as the name of the hundred and as that of the isolated old Grange, which must once, one would suppose,

If the family inhabiting the Grange had been wholly dependent upon the few acres of ungrateful soil which remained to them, they would have been miserably poor, and the Grange would not have exhibited that appearance of good repair and solid comfort which, despite its grimness, and loneliness, and bleakness, it had the character of. The fact was that the Garstangs had for several generations past held, from father to son, a large farm on the estate of the Earl of Linacre, a territorial magnate, whose property lay chiefly on the other or eastern side of Billmouth, where, in a lovely situation not far from the coast, and some five or six miles from Billmouth, the Linacres had a noble residence, known as Linacre Park. The Garstangs were, therefore, well-to-do people as farmers, though they would have been very poor folks as landowners only.

The coasts of the ocean seem to take a quality of mutability from the notorious character of their moody neighbour. The change in the nature of the coast-line, and of the lands which lie in the immediate neighbourhood behind it, is often startlingly sudden and violent. Thus the coast to the eastward, of Billmouth was low, gentle in its slopes, and bordered a rich, fertile, and well-wooded country. It was this coast-line that bounded the well-tilled fields and sunny sloping meadows of the Linacre property. Then came the estuary of the little river Bill, with the little town at its mouth. And beyond this, to the westward, the character of the coast and of the country was entirely different. Geologically, agriculturally, and landscapeically, all was different. The coast became high, bold, and craggy. The land which lay behind it changed from deep fertile soil to poor hungry uplands. Some victorious Norman Linacre, in the old time, had known well how to carve out for himself his portion of the soil, which mail-clad chivalry had won from its comparatively defenceless owners, and had left to the yeoman of the conquered race only the poverty-smitten fields, which would barely pay for culture. The general aspect of the country, too, on the favoured eastern side of the estuary of the Bill differed altogether from that to the westward. Rich woods made everything beautiful in the one direction. In the other, all was makedness. At a distance of some miles inland from the coast, the woodland character of the district prevailed also to the westward of the river Bill. And thereabouts were the Artingale woods — another portion of the soil on which the Norman conqueror had laid his hand. So that the bit of his native ground which the old Saxon yeoman had been able to retain in his own possession was a mere strip of stony, high-lying coast land, very bare of trees, very bleak and unlovely to the eye, very ungrateful to the hand that tilled it, very constantly swept by the bitter blasts from the ocean, and generally dreary and desolate-looking in its character. Yet here Garstang of Garstang had lived and clung to the soil from father to son for more than six hundred years; and from father to son had loved the dreary spot, and had, for several generations at least, tilled the richer land of the Norman, for the sake of maintaining the old Grange, and themselves in it, in the condition of stability and decent comfort in which it had been handed down to them.

The position of “The Grange” was a remarkable one. Perched on the highest cliff of that part of the coast, it was visible far out at sea, and from many a distant inland position. There was not a tree near it. Square, heavy, and strong-looking, it seemed to cling to the rock on which it was built in sullen defiance of wind and weather. There had been some little attempt at a garden at the back of the house, but the effort to combat mature seemed to have been given up in despair; nothing would grow there, and the desolation of the abortive attempt had the effect of adding to the general dreariness of the scene. Two or three stunted and contorted yew-trees were the only vegetation that had been able to struggle against the salt-laden northern winds. It would seem as if something either in the character of the race, or in the circumstances of their fortune, had shaped their minds to delight in the special dreariness of the spot on earth’s surface which faté had allotted to them for their own. Bleak and bare as the Garstang acres were, a cosier position for the homestead might have easily been found for it on them. The little estate abutted on its southern frontier on the Artingale woods, and there a site might have been found at least protected from the bitter north wind and the briny spray which it often carried on its wings. But there had been something in the mood of that old Garstang, who had built the existing house, doubtless on the remains of still earlier foundations, which led him to prefer the wild and exposed situation on a cliff hanging over the sea, on the northernmost edge of his land. Even there another than a Garstang, had he heen compelled to choose such a spot for his house, would have made it front towards the south, and away from the sea, so that it might have looked at least over the pleasant woods and distant lowlands belonging to the Artingales and the Linacres. But Garstang of Garstang wanted no such prospect, and had preferred looking out over the billowy sea, which no Norman had been able to break to subjection.

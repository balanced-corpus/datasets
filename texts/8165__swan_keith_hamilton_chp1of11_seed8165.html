<!-- chapter title: AT HER GATES -->

<p>“There is no help for it, Elizabeth,” I said. “You’ll have to give me few more peeps into that diary of yours. I’ve put people off as long as I
can. Don’t you see it would be to your credit to give to the world a few more of your experiences, just to show that they have been very varied?”</p>

<p>We were sitting together in the window of the morning-room at Flisk on a cold April day. I had been tempted to take that most unusual luxury, a holiday early in the year, and I found spring still afar off in my friend’s northern home. There was scarcely a green blade on hedge or tree, and though the grass was fresh and restful to the eye as the spreading lawns merged into the noble park, there were no daisies, and not a primrose on the river’s brim. But there was all the freedom of the open: miles of lovely country, brown fields beginning to smell freshly of the new seaeon, and a certain promise of the laggard in the twitterings of the birds among the boughs. Also that delicate and subtle clearness of the atmosphere which makes the breath of life a delight, and gives one wonderful ideas of space and distance and eterniy. Elizabeth’s home was worthy of her— a sombre, stately, venerable pile, standing erect and unashamed on its little eminence, its grey battlements showing clear cut, like some aristocratic face, against the delicate crystal of the sky. It was entirely unadorned, save where all about the western wing the green ivy had crept tenderly, harmonising exquisitely with the cold grey granite, giving to it the necessary touch of colour and of life. It was many windowed, and within the rooms were noble, yet filled with a solid comfort; in a word, it was a home.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had wisely not interfered with its substantial and fitting furnishing; only her private rooms bore the stamp of her own personality. In the window of the room where we now sat stood the table from the consulting-room in Rayburn Place, and in the dear old revolving chair Elizabeth had a trick of sitting, as she had so often done in those bleosed old days when I could see her when the spirit moved me, with her elbows on the morocco arms and her chin in her hands. She was so sitting as I made my statement, and she looked at me keenly with the merry, penetrating, lovely eyes which gave such character to her face.</p>

<p>“I believe,” she said, solemnly, “that you came for that purpose. Indeed, Keith said only this very morning he believed you had designs upon me ; that he entirely mistrusted your seeming innocence. He believes you to be insatiable for copy.”</p>

<p>“I shall make copy out of him presently, to punish him for such an aspersion on my character,” I said. “May I ask you a question, Elizabeth?”</p>

<p>“You may, though it must be something more pronounced than usual to call for such rare humility.”</p>

<p>I was looking very earnestly at Elizabeth as she spoke; and somehow the need for the question seemed to disappear. She had now been married eighteen months, and there was upon her sweet face a look of absolute content such as is seen on very few. Sometimes in the old days there had been lines of care and worry on her broad brow; these were now all smoothed away.</p>

<p>“Elizabeth, you are an unutterable fraud. You’d pass for one-and-twenty any day. Don’t you think black burning shame, as Marget says, and yonr husband’s hair so hopelessly grey?”</p>

<p>She smiled charmingly.</p>

<p>“You are hedging, madam. What secret do you want to wring from me by those bare-faced flatteries?”</p>

<p>“I only want to ask you, Elizabeth, whether you don’t regret the old busy, harassed life. Have you enough here to fill up that great heart of yours, with its boundless capacity for work and care? So many want to know.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth laughed a little, but presently her eyes grew grave.</p>

<p>“It is a very different life; its restfulness lies upon me like a great flood. I cannot speak about it. Why should I have so much when others have so little? The injustice of it weighs upon me. I have only to wish : the thing is there ; my husband lives to make me blessed.”</p>

<p>” Not entirely ; he sometimes thinks of others, and works for them too, dear ; and even if he didn’t, you are worthy of it.”</p>

<p>” So he says, and you, because you love me ; but in that great city, where you and I have seen something of the unspeakable sadness of life, there are many as worthy, or worthier, and with capacity for joy as keen, who are denied everything, everything but pain. I am fully satisfied. I am, God knows, only sometimes haunted by the fear lest prosperity, freedom from care, absolute happiness, should render me selfish or hardened to the sorrow of others.”</p>

<p>“It will never do that, Elizabeth; you need have no fear.”</p>

<p>“We do what we can, but poverty and evil do not press here as in cities. It is within the reasonable grasp of dealing. We are building a cottage hospital at Port Ellon, and it will be perfect of its kind, so that we can deal with ordinary cases, and even extraordinary ones. But after all it is very little ; we have not the absolute misery of despair and want meeting us on every hand ; it is like playing at doing good.”</p>

<p>” You can plunge into the old paths when you come to London next month,” I said, suggestively.</p>

<p>” Yes, I can ; but I found myself last year a good deal hampered. Elizabeth Glen could go where Mrs. Keith Hamilton is not welcome. I have closed up many doors of usefulness by my marriage.”</p>

<p>” But opened others,” I said, hastily, for I could not bear to hear her even seem to hint at disappointment.</p>

<p>“Oh, of coarse; to begin with, there Keith: to see a man so guilelessly, completely, and absolutely happy is something, and his career is more interesting to me than any case I ever had,” she said, with a lovely blnsh. “I am even ambitious, I believe, within certain limits. Why, who that coming up the avenue?  Do you recognise anybody, dear?”</p>

<p>I stood up and looked out between the heavy hangings, to see a solitary figure coming somewhat wearily up between the bare, wintry-looking trees. A woman evidently, and young, walking slowly and with effort, as if her limbs were weary or unaccustomed to the exertion.</p>

<p>“I don’t know her,” said Elizabeth. ” But she is in trouble, that is quite evident, and a mere girl. I wonder what it can be.”</p>

<p>” We shall see presently. How natural is it that the troubled and the sad should seek the gates of Flisk, even as they used to besiege your door in Rayburn Place! ” I said; and before Elizabeth replied there was a knock at the door, and Margaret looked in.</p>

<p>“I thocht I’d come mysel, ma’am, to explain. That’s Jeanie Falconer that was; she cam to the kitchen door.”</p>

<!-- Next page is an image of Jeanie with the caption "WALKING SLOWLY AND WITH EFFORT" -->

<p>” I don’t know her, Margaret. What does she want?”</p>

<p>” She wants to see you, ma’am. The maister kens the story. It happened afore we cam. She ran awa.”</p>

<p>” And she has come back, I suppose, in trouble ? “</p>

<p>“Aye; and they’ll no tak her in at the Mains, even her ain mither. Will ye see her, mem?”</p>

<p>” Yes ; put her in the library, Margaret, and see that the fire is good,” said Elizabeth, and as the door closed she turned to me. “I remember the story now ; Keith told it to me. There was an Edinburgh artist at the Mains two years ago, painting the strath. Pretty Jeanie was fair amusement for him. He persuaded her to run away with him, but
we thought they were married. What an old story it is! How often have you and I seen it played !”</p>

<p>She seemed saddened by the thought, and presently went down to see the suppliant, and I was left alone. But not for long. It was almost tea-time, and Mr. Hamilton usually turned in at that time, and we often said it was one of the jolliest hours of the day.</p>

<p>“Hulloa, you’re there, and as sober as a judge,” he called out cheerily, as he put his bright face inside the door. “Where’s Elizabeth ? “</p>

<p>” Somebody wanted her downstairs—somebody in trouble.”</p>

<p>” Oh ! ” said he, meditatively. ” Did you happen to hear the name ? “</p>

<p>” Falconer, I think— Jeanie Falconer.”</p>

<p>He gave a long whistle.</p>

<p>” So she’s come back, poor lassie : well, it’s a case for Elizabeth, not for me. Has she been telling you about her pet scheme— the hospital at Port Ellon ? “</p>

<p>” She has just mentioned it ; it’s a fine idea, Mr. Hamilton, and Elizabeth must have some outlet for her energies.”</p>

<p>” But you don’t think she finds it slow here, do you ? ” he asked, and the anxiety on his handsome face indicated how great a matter it was to him.</p>

<p>I could not forbear a smile.</p>

<p>” You have only to look at her face. She is more than content ; but it is not possible for her to sit down and be idly happy. To be doing for others is the litany of her life.”</p>

<p>” Don’t I know it ? ” he said under his breath, and if ever adoration was expressed in a man’s face, I saw it then.</p>

<p>” Suppose we go upstairs and wait for her ; surely she won’t be long.”</p>

<p>We went up, and after waiting about ten minutes I persuaded Mr. Hamilton to let me pour out his tea. And almost immediately Elizabeth joined us. Her face was fluslied, and I saw that she was a little excited.</p>

<p>“Oh, Keith, I am so glad you are in,” she cried. ” That’s poor Jeanie Falconer—Mrs. Tom Gilchrist really ; he did marry her after all.”</p>

<p>” And what’s she doing here, then ? ” asked Mr. Hamilton, with all a man’s abruptness. “A wife ought to stop with her husband. Isn’t that your creed, wife?”</p>

<p>” Yes, other things being equal,” replied Elizabeth, with a significant smile.</p>

<p>” Well, what’s gone wrong ? Were you going to tell us?”</p>

<p>“In a minute. They’ve married in haste and they’re repenting at leisure, apparently. Poor Jeanie overheard him telling an artist friend that his marriage had been a frightful mistake, and the poor little thing acted on her first impulse to run home to her mother. And they wouldn’t take her in.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t they? Well, it was a blow to them. Poor old Falconer has never held up his head in kirk or market since.”</p>

<p>“That’s because he didn’t believe them to be married. I’ve got the certificate right enough here. I’m going over presently to the Mains to let them see it. Margaret will take care of poor Jeanie till her father comes to fetch her.”</p>

<p>” You’ll be a witch if you get Falconer to give in so quickly as all that. He’s slow to anger, but he keeps it up.”</p>

<p>” I’ll make him come if I stop all night, dear,” said Elizabeth, and she looked as if she meant it. ” There isn’t any time in life to keep up feuds, especially in families ; oh, it is too short.”</p>

<p>” Are you going to take Jeanie with you ? ” asked Mr. Hamilton after a moment.</p>

<p>“No, she’ll stay here, and Margaret will see to her. Will you go with me ? ” asked Elizabeth, turning to me. “And if Falconer is amenable, we can take Port Ellon coming back, and see the hospital.”</p>

<p>” Don’t attempt too much in a day, wife,” said Mr. Hamilton, gravely. ” There are seven days in a week, and she has promised us two weeks at least.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth smiled and gave him a little pat on his big broad shoulder, and her look was one of the most exquisite confidence and love. But I saw that her heart was in her mouth, and that she still hid the sorrows of others in her soul.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour we were in Elizabeth’s little Ralli cart, her strong, capable hands on the reins, and the groom behind. Elizabeth was fond of her horses, and proud of them too; the beautiful creature she drove that night seemed to know and respond to her lightest touch.</p>

<p>“Spring tarries here, Elizabeth,” I said, as my eyes wandered across the varied landscape, seeking in vain for the green glory of her skirts.</p>

<p>” Yes, but when she comes it is like a Queen, dear. To see Flisk in June is to get some idea of Paradise. But like winter too, the wideness of the landscape, the bareness of the trees, the wild winds whistling down the glens. Look at the light on the moor yonder; you would never get that dark glow in summer. Port Ellon lies just beyond; the sea is there; when the wind is southerly you get the salt of it even at Flisk.”</p>

<p>“I have a lot of things to see, Elizabeth,” I said. ” Most of all, I think, the lych gate where you and Keith parted so bitterly in the long ago.”</p>

<p>” That’s at Glenspeed, dear, and we need a long day at Glenspeed. There is the Mains. It is just six, so we’ll catch Falconer as he comes in. They’re all busy on the land just now, planting potatoes.”</p>

<p>The Mains, a snug, blue-slated farmhouse on the roadside, with its outbuiloings clustered about it, looked a very tidy, well-managed place. A good garden, with grassy lawn in front, separated it from the road, and was entered by green wicket gate.</p>

<p>” You can come in you like, dear. They won’t mind,” said Elizabeth, as she sprang to the ground.</p>

<p>I hesitated a moment, and then followed her. A little maidservant, evidently much flustered, showed us in, and we were left quite a long time in the old-fashioned sitting-room, which was so exquisitely clean, and smelt so sweetly of lavender and thyme and all the old-fashioned herbs beloved of country housekeepers.</p>

<p>“Now, I wonder why Mrs. Falconer doesn’t come,” said Elizabeth, rather impatiently. ” Well, here’s the old man himself.”</p>

<p>He opened the door, and gave us good evening, with the rugged courtesy of these well-mannered people; and Elizabeth introduced me briefly. The difficulty was that he had not the remotest idea why we had come; and though it was by no means unusual for Mrs. Hamilton to drop in upon the tenants, where she was always welcome, I saw he suspected something unusual. He was an old man, and aged perhaps before his time, but his face was hale and ruddy, and his eye had lost none of its keenness. I walked over to the open window, and looked out, wishing almost that I had not come in.</p>

<p>” Perhaps you’ll think me an impertinent meddler, Mr. Falconer,” began Elizabeth in her direct way. ” But really in this I can’t help myself. I’ve just come from your daughter, Mrs. Tom Gilchrist.”</p>

<p>I felt that the old man frowned, but I did not look round.</p>

<p>” She’s at Flisk, and I want to know why she isn’t here. Where’s Mrs. Falconer ? “</p>

<p>“She’s tendin’ a sick woman at the men’s hooses,” he answered. ” Mrs. Tom Gilchrist, as ye ca’ her, has made her bed, an’ she can lie on’t. I’m for nae returned goods here.”</p>

<p>” Now that’s all nonsense,” said Elizabeth cheerily, though I am confident, had these words been addressed in such a voice to me, I should have beat a hasty retreat. “She isn’t returned goods at all. It was the most natural thing in the world that she should take a longing to see her mother, to say nothing of you.”</p>

<p>” I’m for nane o’ her here,” he retorted, angrily. “An ungratefu’ hizzie, bringin’ disgrace on folk that wad hae deed to serve her. She maun mak the best o’ her penter body noo she’s got him, as I telt her the day; an’ it shows what a puir craven spirit is in her that she wad gang wi’ a puir face to you, mem.”</p>

<p>“It was surely better to come to me than to some who would take joy in spreading the tale,” Elizabeth answered quickly. ” Did her mother see her to-day?”</p>

<p>“Her mither sees eye to eye wi’ me, as she should,” replied Mains, sternly.</p>

<p>“I daresay you dared her to say word on her own account,” observed Elizabeth, drily. “Come now, Mr. Falconer, be sensible. Jeanie has come back to see you, and a bonnie talk it will be in the countryside if she stays at Flisk instead of here, where she ought to be. She was afraid you wouldn’t believe she was really married, so she brought this with her. Don’t you think it will be wise to make the best of a bad job?”</p>

<p>She handed him the certificate, and he did glance over it, but his brows did not relax.</p>

<p>“She maun learn that her faithtr an’ mither are no auld boots to be kicket aboot, onyway. She can gang back to her man. It’s whaur she should be, onyway.”</p>

<p>” Well, she will go back to him by-and by,” said Elizabeth, desperately, for it was like beating against a stone wall. ” The poor thing is ill and weary. She needs her mother’s advice and help. It was the most natural thing in the world she should seek it just now.”</p>

<p>“What for did he no come wi’ her, an’ own up as a man should that he’s been a rascal ? ” said the old farmer, sourly.</p>

<p>Elizabeth made no reply for a moment or so. I was waiting for her to explain that there had been at least some little difference between poor Jeanie and her husband, but she never said a word.</p>

<p>” Well, what’s to be done, Mr. Falconer ? ” she said presently. “Am I to go back and tell poor Jeanie that she must return to Edinburgh tomorrow ? “</p>

<p>” It wad serve her richt,” he said, dourly ; but I, who knew his kind well, detected relenting in his voice.</p>

<p>” Where’s the cottage where Mrs. Falconer is nursing? I think I’ll go and see what she says about it,” said Elizabeth then.</p>

<p>” Ye needna fash. I’ll yoke an’ gang up to Flisk for the lass, although it’s sair against the grain ; but she canna bide here mair than a nicht. I gied her my mind this efternune. I’ll never forgie her : it’s jist to save you bother, mem. She had nae business to intrude upon you.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth went up to the old man and laid her hand on his arm, looking at him with those deep, sweet eyes of hers, whose appeal few could resist.</p>

<p>” The father’s heart is speaking now, Mr. Falconer, and you are thinking of the days when Jeanie pu’d the gowans on the roadside and said her prayers at hei mother’s knee. She is not less your bairn than she was then. Deal with her as we all pray God will deal with us for our rebellion and disobedience to His will.”</p>

<p>” Maybe I’ve been ower hard,” he said, almost in a whisper. ” But she was my idol, an’ a broken idol’s sair to thole.”</p>

<p>“Jeanie’s heart is full of love and of sorrow for all she has done. She will make it up to you, and her mother will sleep to-night, I know, as she has not slept since Jeanie ran away.”</p>

<p>” Maybe you’re richt,” he said. ” Weel, I’ll yoke an’ gang ower.”</p>

<p>” At once ? ” said Elizabeth, anxiously. ” We’re going on to Port Ellon, but we’ll meet you coming back.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll gang the noo.”</p>

<p>He went away out with speed, not deeming it necessary to say a word of thanks to the laird’s wife for the trouble she had taken. Gratitude, I found, was in the hearts of these plain folks, but seldom on their lips.</p>

<p>” You didn’t tell him that Jeanie had run away from her husband, Elizabeth,” I said, as we walked out to the trap.</p>

<p>“No, it is long since I learned to be as wise as a serpent and as harmless as a dove when dealing with family matters,” she replied, soberly. ” Besides, she hasn’t run away ; she’s going back if he doesn’t come to fetch her.”</p>

<p>We climbed to our places and drove off rapidly along the bare road on the moor edge, and presently we saw the sea. It was very grey and cold looking, but its wideness did not fail to satisfy ; there is no mood of my nature which the sea cannot soothe and satisfy. Port Ellon, a little fishing hamlet, lay scattered between two headlands, and was well
sheltered on either side. It was a picturesque little spot, with such yellow sands and sheltered crannies among the rocks, that I wonder it has not been overrun long ago.</p>

<p>” There’s the hospital—look, just behind the church. We need not drive up to inspect it, or we shall be late for dinner. You see it is going to be a very fair building. I supervised the plans myself, and it will be a model. I often say to Keith they’ll come from far and near to see it.”</p>

<p>“And will you be a visiting physician?” I asked.</p>

<p>” Why, yes, that’s the object of it. What’s the use of everything—my London M.B., for instance, of which I’m so proud—if I can’t do that much? I’m quite looking forward to it, but Keith won’t let me spend a penny on it. It’s his, every stone and brick, but it’ll be mine when it’s done. Don’t you think I have a devoted husband, dear?”</p>

<p>I did not say what I thought, that these two, united in heart and in purpose, had but one desire— to serve their day and generation to the very best of their ability. And I thanked God for high position and great wealth so humbly and graciously used, for lives devoted to the Master’s service. But I grudged them to their quiet home, where the need was less great than the city where Elizabeth had laboured so faithfully and with such signal success. We were rather quiet as we drove back, and about
a quarter of a mile past the Mains we met the gig with Jeanie and her father in it.</p>

<p>Elizabeth did not stop, only waved her hand and cried cheerily, ” I’ll come along to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>” It’s all right,” she said in satisfied voice; ” he’s given in: that was the hard bit. Now he won’t know what to do to make up to Jeanie for being hard on her this afternoon. Oh, my dear, what would I not give to be sitting beside my dear old dad!—to think he should only have lived a month after I came to Flisk, and I looking forward to years by his side; but I’m thankful he lived to see me Keith’s wife. I shall never forget his face the day we came home. He looked just like Simeon, and I know he was saying in his heart, ‘Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace.’ When he died he told me he had not a single wish on earth unfulfilled.”</p>

<p>“Not many can say that, Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>“Not many lived like him, an Israelite indeed, without guile. God gives such special benediction. Did tell you, dear, that Keith was dining out to-night?—a bachelors’ dinner at Corrybreck. We’ll have a dip into that old diary to-night.”</p>

<p>And we had, and Elizabeth said she would allow me to take as many pages from it as I liked. But I said I would lather take the stories down from her lips, for I felt sure my readers wanted to hear her speak again.</p>

<p>Next morning, as we walked in the grounds near the lodge gates a hired fly drove rapidly down the road.</p>

<p>” Do you know who that is, dear ?” she said with a satisfied nod. “It’s Tom Gilchrist, the artist. He’s going to the Mains now, and it’ll be all made up. I guessed how it would be. How foolish these young people are, and how they play with their life’s happiness as if it were a game at marbles ! “</p>

<p>” I know somebody else who played with her life’s happiness,” I said severely, ” and who nearly wrecked it too.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we go back to the house, dear,” said Elizabeth, demurely, “and see what Keith is going to do for our amusement this lovely day.”</p>

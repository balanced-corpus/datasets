<p>
All beauty and all life he was to her: <br>
She questioned not his love, she only knew <br>
That she loved him—<br>
Lowell. <br>
I’ll tell the story of her life.
</p>
</div>
<p>
Lady Helen as usual went to Maud’s room that 
evening, and found her alone sitting before the 
fire; her unbound hair fell in thick, shining waves 
around her, and she sat leaning forward, gazing 
into the burning embers.
</p> 
<p>
Lady Helen stood for a moment still, looking 
at her; her eyes were drooping, half drowsy, with 
an intense happiness, the whole expression of her 
face denoting so clearly the pure joy of a happy 
heart, that her friend instinctively felt what had 
happened.
</p>
<p>
She came towards her, and, laying her hand on 
her shoulder, said, gently,</p>
<p>“You are happy: tell me all about it.”</p>
<p>Maud pressed her lips to the hand resting on 
her shoulder, and said, smiling,</p> 
<p>“Yes, I am happy; I did not dare hope for it; 
I——” and there she stopped, blushing beautifully.</p>
<p>“When did he speak to you?” asked her friend.</p>
<p>“In the library, before dinner.”</p>
<p>“I thought so, and prevented Lilias from going to look for you; 
dearest, you must let me tell you how glad I am!”</p>
<p>She sat down, and Maud drew a stool near her, 
and sat with her head resting on Helen’s lap.</p>
<p>“You know,” she said, flushing, “I was so sorry 
I had been so foolish last night about ‘County Guy;’ 
I was so afraid he was vexed; and then, this evening 
it was such a surprise, and oh, such a happiness, hearing him tell me how he loves 
me—I, who had never dreamed of what was 
in store for me; for I have loved him for a long 
time, ever since we were at Lord Glenbracken’s 
in the autumn last year—and then, you know, my 
father asked him, and he came, to Invercorrie for 
a fortnight.”</p>
<p>Lady Helen looked at her with a sort of wonder. 
What was this love, that seemed so all powerful— 
that had changed the thoughtless girl’s face so 
curiously, giving a happy depth to the eyes, 
a roseate flush to the delicate cheek, and a strange 
quiver to the sensitive, half-parted lips?</p>
<p>She herself had never felt this; she had never 
known what it was to love, at least in the way that 
Maud loved; she herself had hardly seen her 
husband half-a-dozen times before he proposed to 
her, and she had accepted him because she knew 
her mother wished it.</p>
<p>Poor proud Lady Kilmore did not understand 
being the poor widow of an Irish peer, and she 
had determined that her daughter, Lady Helen, 
should make a rich marriage.</p>
<p>Some few people remembered handsome Lord 
Kilmore; how he had been the life of every 
drawing-room, with his bright, witty, original 
talk; and these few did not disdain to notice the 
widow and daughter of their old friend, who 
had died deeply involved, leaving nothing that 
would keep them in the luxury they had been 
used to.</p>
<p>Among these few friends had been Sir James 
Danvers, who had come forward most generously, 
and had, with the most graceful tact and courtesy, 
helped Lady Kilmore in a manner that did not 
make her feel under any unpleasant obligation.</p>
<p>He admired the handsome and strangely shy 
girl, and she reminded him of George Devereux in 
his younger days, when they had gone to Italy 
together, before their romance had quite left them.</p>
<p>Lady Helen knew better than her mother how 
deeply they were indebted to Sir James Danvers 
for deliverance from their troubles, and, besides, 
she wished to show him how little she cared for a 
“good match,” and so she took no trouble to make 
herself pleasant to him, and did not in his presence 
exert her powers of conversation, which were 
brilliant.</p>
<p>He did not like her the less for not seeming to 
court him, he could understand her; but her 
indifference rendered her the more enticing, and 
from force of habit partly, and partly from a wish 
to make her know him better, he spent almost 
every afternoon with Lady Kilmore; but Helen, 
with strange perversity, made a point of absenting 
herself, and was hardly ever in the room when he 
was there.</p>
<p>He bore this patiently for a while, but at last 
grew enraged, and, worn out by repeated failures 
of seeing her, he one evening formally demanded 
her hand of Lady Kilmore.</p>
<p>Helen had returned home late that evening from 
visiting some old school friend, and found her 
mother waiting for her in the small drawing-room 
with her face happier than she had seen it since 
her father’s death. She saw that something unusual 
had happened, and, throwing her bonnet on 
the sofa, sat down near her and asked, “what was the matter?”</p>
<p>She was in good spirits, and Lady Kilmore, 
with careful woman’s tact, told her what had happened, 
described how devoted Sir James Danvers 
was to her, at which Lady Helen shrugged her 
shoulders, and raised her eyebrows, and after a 
good deal more conversation asked her coaxingly 
to see him to-morrow and give him her answer.</p>
<p>Lady Helen stared vaguely at the fire, almost 
stunned by the sudden shock, but she presently 
said, in an unnaturally quiet voice,</p>
<p>“Very well; you must settle it.”</p>
<p>Why should she not marry him? her mother 
wished it; it was a good marriage; her mother 
was not used to the daily annoyances that now 
pressed round her on every side. If she married 
Sir James Danvers, she could give her mother a 
home. But she was so young, only seventeen; it 
seemed so odd to marry now; it was a thing she 
had never thought much about. She had never 
loved anybody—she had adored her father, and 
had been his companion in all his occupations, and 
had always gone into society with him, for her 
mother had of late years been in too delicate health 
to allow of her going out much; and Lady Helen, 
though so young, looked far older than she really 
was, at least people forgot her extreme youth in 
the curious charm of her conversation.</p>
<p>She was greatly appreciated: but the only 
praise she coveted and treasured jealously was 
her father’s; to his society she would turn with 
undisguised delight and affection at all times, and 
never for a moment dreamt of thinking of the 
men who crowded round her, anxious for a 
word or smile from Lord Kilmore’s handsome 
daughter.</p>
<p>Her father’s death had been her one sorrow: she 
could scarcely realize the intensity of her devotion 
until he was taken from her; she grieved for him 
sincerely and heartily, and was disgusted at the 
gradual falling off of so-called “friends,” and drew 
more and more into herself.</p>
<p>Regarding this offer of Sir James Danvers, she 
felt it deeply; she felt how disinterested it was in him 
to choose her, a girl without any dowry—he must 
love her ! she felt it would be rather pleasant to be 
the <em>first</em> to any one, to have all her wishes consulted, 
and be given everything she asked for; and 
then, he was rich, and they had been so uncomfortable 
since her father’s death, and it would be 
very enjoyable to mix once again in the world, 
and hear what was going on, and have people of 
real worth and standing in her house, 
and to listen to the amusing, clever talk which she had 
missed more than anything during the past year.</p>
<p>She could not, it is true, love Sir James as she 
had loved her father; but she could give him a 
very warm and sincere feeling, which she, never 
having truly loved, fancied was love, but was 
really only a very high order of gratitude, and she 
would try to please him and make him happy. 
She did like him, or rather she had a great 
respect and esteem for him: he was clever, she 
felt he was not a fool, she could not have married 
a fool! He was, it is true, more than thirty years 
her senior, but she did not think that signified; she 
must marry—all women did, and why should she 
not marry Sir James Danvers?</p>
<p>All these things flitted across her brain as she 
stood in the firelit drawing-room, and again she said,—</p>
<p>“Very well, you must settle it,” and kneeling 
down by her mother, she took the little hands in 
her own, saying, in a fond, childish way, “And 
then, mammy darling, you will live with me always.”</p>
<p>Poor Lady Kilmore only lived long enough to 
see her daughter married. The year’s struggles 
had been too much for her; but she died happy in 
the consciousness that Helen was provided for, 
and the mistress of a house such as she had been born to rule.</p>
<p>And now, my reader, you can perhaps understand 
the feelings with which Lady Helen looked 
at Maud Hazledean, as she sat before the fire 
gazing straight into the burning coals with her 
wonderfully happy eyes, and after a while she said,—</p>
<p>“It must be very pleasant to feel thus; tell me, what is it like?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I cannot! it is all so new, so strange. I 
can hardly understand it yet!” She paused, 
then said, “You must not tell any one that I am 
engaged to Guy—Major Conyngham. I am not 
even going to tell my father.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Because you know he—Guy—is going away directly to India, 
and he has seen so little of me, 
and I of him, and he thinks it would not be fair to 
bind me by any formal engagement, so I shall say 
nothing till he returns. Guy is going to write to 
his father, but says he does not intend telling 
his brother—he has a young brother Vane at Bonn.”</p>
<p>“He thinks, I suppose, that you are hardly old 
enough to know your own mind?” asked Lady Helen.</p>
<p>“Yes, that is what he thinks, you know,” said 
Maud, apologetically; “he knows nothing about 
girls: as if,” she continued, smiling securely, “as if 
we should either of us ever change when we love 
one another so dearly; however, he wished it to 
be so,” and she was silent with satisfied confidence.</p>
<p>Lady Helen smiled.</p>
<p>“You dear child!” she said, fondly, “how I 
envy you! how strange it must be to feel as you 
do! how I wish I could ‘love,’ as you call it! tell 
me, how did it all happen—what did he say to you?”</p>
<p>Maud coloured.</p>
<p>“Ah, how can I? Such language is not made 
to be repeated. What has been the mutual and 
impassioned voice of two hearts, sounds unnatural 
and foolish in its fondness to a third. But it 
is enough for me that he told me he loved me, 
and would love me always, now and through all eternity.”</p>
<p>She ceased speaking, her eyes filled with tears, 
but after a moment she continued,—</p>
<p>“It does seem very hard that he should have to 
leave me just as we are so happy; but he is 
obliged to go, and I should be so sorry if he 
neglected doing what is right for my sake; and 
then, when he comes back— Ah! I have indeed 
lived to learn that to love and to be loved is a 
deeper joy and a greater happiness than anything 
else in the world!”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think it must be,” said her friend, 
thoughtfully; “how I should like to experience 
the feeling!” and she murmured softly,</p>

<div>
<p>
“Du Heilige rufe dein kind zurück,<br>
Ich habe genossen das irdische Glück,<br>
Ich habe gelebt und geliebet.
</p>
</div>
<p>“I can now quite understand Thekla’s feelings,” 
said Maud; “I don’t think it ever came home to 
me before as it does now. It is so strange the 
feeling I have! the thought of waking to-morrow 
morning with the momentary forgetfulness, but the 
strange undefined sense of happiness! Hitherto 
the consciousness that such a being as Guy 
existed was sufficient for me; but the knowledge 
that he is now mine, mine for always, sets my 
heart beating and my pulses throbbing in a way 
that I cannot describe to you. Looking forward is 
so different now, to long years of happiness, when 
I shall be with him wherever he is, and be his 
first thought, his dearest object. Then growing old 
seems quite another thing now: I do not feel as if 
he would ever be old to me, for our love will always 
be as young and fresh as now;” and she looked 
into the fire with dim, far-seeing eyes, imagining 
the distant future, with Guy and herself growing 
old together, and walking down the hill of life 
hand in hand.</p>
<p>“I have always thought,” said Lady Helen, 
“that the most beautiful description of happy love 
I ever read was contained in a few lines George 
Paget gave me the other day—listen,” and she repeated gently,</p>
<!-- small text -->
<div>
<p>
“We’ll live together like two neighbour vines,<br>
Circling our souls and loves in one another;<br>
We’ll spring together, and we’ll bear one fruit;<br>
One joy shall make us smile, and one grief mourn;<br>
One age go with us, and one hour of death<br>
Shall close our eyes, and one grave make us happy.”
</p>
</div>
<p>They spoke but little more after this, and when 
Lady Helen lay down to rest, it was to think over 
what Maud had been saying, and to muse over the 
ideal image of the one she could love “in meditation—<em>not</em> fancy free!”</p>
<p>Although Miss Hazledean’s engagement was 
known only to Lady Helen and myself, every 
one suspected that such an event was likely to 
happen, and Lady Helen, with careful tact and 
management, talking rather mysteriously to Mr. Mainwaring, 
so arranged that they should be left 
as much as possible together.</p>
<p>These were, perhaps, the purest and happiest 
hours of their lives. Guy and Maud had the 
most implicit faith in each other, and in their love. 
There was no shadow cast over the perfect 
happiness of the moment, for, although Guy 
must be absent for a time, nothing could ever 
alter the deep affection which he felt for Maud. 
Of this she felt assured, and even when she felt 
grieved at the idea that they must be separated 
for a time, she felt a thrill of pleasure in the 
knowledge that it would not now be as before—that 
he loved her and had told her so, and that 
she could now, without hesitation or distrust, 
cherish in her heart his image; even death, 
she felt, would not sever the tie which now 
united them, and futurity had no terrors for 
her, because she believed in an eternity of love.</p>
<p>Then the dreamy happiness of those long talks 
with Guy, during which he told her with the 
most perfect truthfulness the whole of his past 
life. He could do this without doubt and hesitation, 
for his life had been pure, and there were 
no pages in it, as is the case with most men, 
which must remain sealed for ever from the 
woman who was to be his companion for life. 
He had been taught to look on women with the 
chivalrous feeling of the Knights of the Round 
Table, and he scorned to allow a single evil 
thought to dwell in his mind with regard to 
them, and inspired a reverence in all men with 
whom he associated by the gentle and manly 
modesty of his language and conduct in all that related to women.</p>
<p>All this was done without the slightest affectation, 
and all who knew Guy Conyngham checked 
every immodest word and thought while they 
were in his presence; and yet there were few 
men whose society was more sought and prized 
than Guy’s, and few exercised a more genial 
influence; it was the influence of real goodness 
springing from a generous and affectionate heart.</p>
<p>Guy told Maud the details of a childhood which 
had been singularly happy: his first and only 
great sorrow had been the loss of a fond and 
gentle mother, whose memory he cherished and 
to whom he referred every action of his life, as 
if, from the region of rest to which her pure 
spirit had fled, she could still, as in his childhood, 
watch over and direct him. He also told Maud 
with manly simplicity of the scenes of suffering 
and carnage of which he had been a witness 
in the Crimea, and spoke with genuine modesty 
of the distinguished part he had himself borne in the war.</p>
<p>Maud had heard of Guy’s courage and devotion 
from others, and pressed him with fond, loving 
questions about himself; her evident pride in 
him, and the deep reverence with which she 
spoke of the fulfilment of her future duties as 
his wife and helpmate, deeply touched Guy’s 
heart, and he felt that he had been thrice blessed 
in the love which she so freely and entirely 
bestowed upon him; and as she nestled near 
him it was his delight to listen to the life-like 
sketches which Maud gave of her childhood.</p>
<p>Who has not been struck with the curious 
reality with which women clothe the narrative 
of their lives? It must be that, being more 
sensitive and impressionable than men, they feel 
more deeply the minor details of life, and retain 
them more fixedly in their memories. It is certain 
that a woman’s life, related by herself, never 
fails to bring vivid and life-like people and places 
before the listener, and leaves him with the feeling 
of having actually seen the persons mentioned, 
and of having visited the scenes of the narrative, 
so full of form and colour are women’s histories of their own lives.</p>
<p>Conyngham took an intense pleasure in questioning 
Maud minutely on the details of her past life; 
he felt—as who has not who has loved?—an unreasoning 
regret that so many years of Maud’s 
life should have been passed in entire separation 
from his own life and thoughts. He loved to 
identify the places and people of which she spoke, 
and himself to speak of them as if he also had 
known them. There was to him a tender sense 
of joy in the feeling that, while listening to Maud, 
and learning all the details of her girlhood, he was 
being made a sharer in her past life, and that 
before they separated he should know his darling 
entirely, from the first moment when she was 
conscious of existence, until the crowning instant 
of confused and passionate happiness when she had 
confessed her love for him.</p>
<p>It was this idea that gave so great a charm to 
those long hours during which Maud told Guy 
every event in her life which had influenced her 
thoughts and feelings. There was no single phase 
of her life which she hid from him; she loved him 
so entirely that she trusted to him to take her to 
his heart with every fault and weakness that she 
revealed to him. She felt that these very faults 
and weaknesses were claims on his loving protection, 
and she would exclaim, “Guy, dear Guy, 
will you make me as good as you are?” and feel, 
as she saw his face radiant with happiness, that in 
perfect, mutual love was to be found the magic 
thread which would enable her, without one 
faltering step, to pass through the mazes of the 
labyrinth of this world, escaping its temptations, 
which would be powerless with Guy by her side.</p>
<p>Then she rejoiced at the idea that as long 
as she lived she should share his joys, and if 
sorrow came she thought how light it would 
become now that she had the refuge of that 
brave heart, her dearest possession. Maud, though 
a gentle, loving woman, was not without her faults, 
the chief of with was an impulsiveness which led 
her to act on the impressions of the moment, and 
in the hasty conviction produced by them. Many 
were the childish miseries which the habit produced, 
and Conyngham, while he smiled at the 
comic mishaps and adventures of her girlish days, 
earnestly pointed out to her the danger and sorrow 
entailed in life by this impatience for decision and 
action, and how often cruel injustice is done to 
others by hasty condemnation.</p>
<p>“Never, my darling Maud,” Guy would say, 
“condemn others without hearing all they have 
to say. Remember how deceitful appearances 
may be, and give yourself time to reflect deeply 
and earnestly before you finally pronounce a judgment.”</p>
<p>Maud would look fondly at him, and exclaim,—</p>
<p>“Of course, dear Guy, I shall alter now, and 
become more worthy each day of your love! Oh, 
Guy! I think I would give up anything, do 
anything, in the happy certainty that I am yours 
always, that you will never cease to love me!”</p>

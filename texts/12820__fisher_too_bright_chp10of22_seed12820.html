<title>Chapter 10 of Too Bright To Last by Fisher</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">

<p>
The coffee did wonders for Mrs. Sackville, and when dinner-time came, she was able to take the head of the table, with Hepburn
<em>vis-à-vis</em>, carving, and making himself impartially agreeable to the ladies.
</p>
<p>
Georgie glided into her place at the very last minute.
</p>
<p>
She sat with her back to the light; but Christopher thought that her voice was very expressionless.
</p>
<p>
She was like a grey shade, in her soft, neutral tinted dress, and hair from which all the gold seemed to have faded. She spoke
as she always did, and now and then relapsed into her habitual joyousness; but it is impossible to judge from that, Hepburn
knew. When the natural attitude of a person’s mind is either grave or vivacious, it is not one violent shock, one sudden joy,
that can at once alter it.
</p>
<p>
During-dinner time, Mrs. Sackville was agreeable, but sarcastic—aiming, as was her wont, most of her arrows at the devoted
heart of Edith, whose good-temper under like circumstances Hepburn had frequently admired, though his admiration was tempered
by the consideration that she was protected from most of these shafts by a natural armour of great invulnerability.
</p>
<p>
If Georgie had kept herself quiet, she would have escaped without notice; but not content to leave well alone, she must needs
take up the cudgels in her sister’s defence, and had to fight pretty vigorously for herself in consequence.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Sackville, with sly innuendoes and insinuations, and expressive gestures, went so near once or twice to touching upon the
dangerous ground of recent occurrences, as to make more than one of her listeners tremble: especially Edith, who, it is to be
hoped, will one day be put in possession of the ultimate blessings assured to peacemakers.
</p>
<p>
Every one was glad when, the church-bells beginning to ring, the ladies rose to put on their bonnets.
</p>
<p>
The church was hot and stuffy, the service long, and the preacher conceited; and Hepburn voted evening service in July an
intolerable bore.
</p>
<p>
Still, sitting on the same bench with Greorgina, and finding her places in her hymn-book, he was better off than young Elles,
the millionaire’s heir-apparent, who had come to church three times every Sunday for the last twelve months on the mere chance
of being able to contemplate her back hair and right ear, which was all the view he could command from the family pew.
</p>
<p>
After service was over, Hepburn walked slowly home with the two sisters.
</p>
<p>
It was a lovely starlight night. They came through the gardens of the square, and on to a broad terrace, the common property
of all the houses on one side, each of which was approached by a glass door. As Edith passed in, Hepburn laid a gently-detaining
hand upon Georgina’s dress.
</p>
<p>
“It’s such a beautiful night,”he whispered; “come and look at the stars.”
</p>
<p>
They allowed Edith to proceed at once into the house, and, leaning on the stone balustrading, watched high overhead the golden
lyre; then Hepburn said, “I daresay you don’t thank me much for meddling with your affairs in the way I’ve been doing to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t suppose you liked doing so any better than I liked your doing it; but since we’re talking about it, and as you seem
to know everything, I must say I think mamma might have spoken to him herself.”
</p>
<p>
“I quite agree with you; it would have been much better. It puzzles me to think why I should have been selected for the task.
I never felt so much out of place in my life.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m very sorry you should have been put into such a position on my account.”
</p>
<p>
He took no notice of this, but said, softly, “Will you let me tell you what a fine fellow I think he is?”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” Georgie murmured, with downcast head.
</p>
<p>
“It’s no use my talking an awful lot of humbug to you, you know, about his being in such a totally different position to you.
I know why you like him, and I like you for liking him; and I think all that trash about social differences utterly unworthy
of being regarded between you two.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you were kind to him?” Georgie asked, with glistening eyes.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know about being kind. I told him what your mother said I was to tell him in as few words as I could. I don’t think
men are often kind to each other exactly.”
</p>
<p>
“If mamma thinks I’ll ever give him up she’s very much mistaken, Mr. Hepburn.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course she is. You’ll see, she’ll get quite reconciled to the idea in time, if she sees you mean to be constant. It’s
wonderful the effect of time, in cases like this,” said Hepburn equivocally.
</p>
<p>
“Constant! I should think I should be constant. You don’t know what he is, Mr. Hepburn. He isn’t good-looking, you see that,
and I know how plain his ways are, but oh, indeed, he has a heart of gold!”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure he must be a good fellow, Georgie, to have gained your love.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, but you have no idea of <em>how</em> good he is. Some times I quite tremble when I think how unworthy I am of his love.”
</p>
<p>
Some trifling and unsanctified expression escaped Hepburn, which did not reach his fair companion.
</p>
<p>
She continued. “He always seems to act from such much higher principles than we do. I suppose it’s from living thoughtfully,
and so much alone in the country. I remember his once saying how much easier he thought it was to get to heaven in the country
than in town; and I believe he’s quite right—don’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“I daresay—I don’t think I try much.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish you could talk to him for a little while; I’m sure you’d like him, he has read so much, and says such out-of-the-way
sort of things.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure he’s a man of a very original sort of genius.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed, he’s very unlike any man I ever saw.”
</p>
<p>
This was all very fine, but he wondered how long it was going to last, for it was rather a trial to his magnanimity standing
there listening to, and chiming in with, his rival’s praises.
</p>
<p>
“You believe, I hope,” said he, a trifle constrainedly, “you believe, I hope, that I entirely sympathise with you, and would
willingly do everything in the world that’s in my power to promote your happiness?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you’re so kind. I really don’t know how to thank you enough.” The thanks were almost too much for him, as, with her sweet
eyes brimming over with tears, she extended her hand to him. She said, “You can’t think what a relief it has been to me to talk
about this to you. I have pent it all up these many days, until I felt as if my heart would break. I haven’t had a soul who
would speak to me about it. Oh, it has been so hard!”
</p>
<p>
“Poor child!”
</p>
<p>
It was a strange mixture of feelings that he experienced as he looked at her. He was half generous friend, half treacherous
foe; he should be wholly the latter, he felt, if he stood there a minute longer. He took a shawl, which hung on her arm,
wrapped it round her, and concluded with saying, “You will talk to me whenever you like about this, won’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“I will, indeed. Oh, you’re a real friend, I feel!”
</p>
<p>
And so they went into the house together.
</p>
<p>
Hepburn assisted Georgie in the playing and singing of spiritual melodies to Mrs. Sackville, whose features wronged her
feelings by an expression of perfect peace. He had so passed many a Sunday evening not disagreeably, but this particular one,
in spite of having placed himself so that he could contemplate Georgie’s fair face, which was unusually softened and sanctified,
at his pleasure, he felt ill at ease, and sighed secretly for the soothing cigar, which should once more put him on good
terms with himself.
</p>
<p>
It was earlier than usual, therefore, when he stood up to take leave, and having received a surprisingly cordial invitation
from Mrs. Sackville to come again as often as he liked, he betook himself to his own comfortable lodgings.
</p>
<p>
Georgie was unfeignedly sorry when he went away. She liked him very much always—better than ever now, since his admirable
conduct and affectionate sympathy with regard to Vane; and he was looked upon by her with that peculiar tenderness that most
women have to bestow upon men whose deepest love they can not respond to. Besides she was half dreading, half hoping for some
explanation with her mother, which should take place directly he was gone, and which she would willingly postpone as long as
possible. But when he had taken his departure, and Edith too rose, and yawned, and began to light a bed-candle, Georgie looked
in vain for her mother to make some sign of a wish for a private conversation with her. She waited a minute expectantly, and
then, receiving no more than a good-night, into which was infused the slightest possible frigidity, she went to bed.
</p>
<p>
There are people, enviable people, who play equally well all games where skill combines with chance—croquet, chess, whist,
and the game of life. The only drawback to those who give their minds to moving the pawns in this last game according to their
own good pleasure is, that they are apt to have very restless nights.
</p>
<p>
In consequence of having to arrange and rearrange two or three times her plans for the next two years during the hours that
should have been devoted to sleep, poor Mrs. Sackville rose very little refreshed by her bed. So soon as she was come down,
too, the receipt of a very small note with a very large illuminated monogram and crest caused her to despatch Hermann for
a four-wheeled cab, and to have herself driven, in spite of the badness of the weather and an aching head, rapidly to Hapbrook
House, the magnificent mansion of the Elles family.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Elles was a confirmed invalid. I don’t know what was the matter with her—I don’t think anybody else did, not excepting
herself; certainly not the great homoeopathic doctor, who came twice a week regularly, and alternately smiled and shook his
head. But her maladies afforded her an occupation, without which she would have been sadly at a loss; and her complete
restoration to health would scarcely have been regarded as a boon by herself.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Elles was something in the City; people said he had made his money early in life as a railway contractor—that both he and
his wife were of far from distinguished origin—one, a woman I’m afraid, averred that she had seen Mrs. Elles, with turned-up
sleeves, washing a door-step: but no one listened much to any of these stories, inasmuch as the Elleses were not only rich,
but hospitable in the fullest meaning of the world; they had a very fine house, and a very fine carriage with a very big crest
upon it; their dinners were frequent and undeniable—and what more should one want in Westbourne Grove, or anywhere else.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Elles received Mrs. Sackville in the most friendly way imaginable, in the grand dining-room with the Exhibition sideboard
and bronzes, where two or three tangled-haired fisher boys stared wonderingly down at the little yellow woman in brocade and
lace who sat there of mornings.
</p>
<p>
A few lines may well state what it took Mrs. Sackville more than three-quarters of an hour’s conversation, including the
inevitable preliminary medical twenty minutes, to discover, namely, the reasons which had induced Mrs. Elles to summon her
thus early to her presence, and to which, in her hurried note, she had not thought fit to do more than to allude obscurely.
</p>
<p>
The attachment of the dutiful Charles Elles to Miss Georgina Sackville had been at no time a secret to his parents, who, so
far from discouraging the tender sentiment, were disposed to use any means in their power to bring matters to a happy
termination. Having this end in view, they had, in strict privacy, talked over the matter with that young lady’s delighted
mother with a frankness which is, I believe, usually confined to the discussion of royal marriages. The girl had no money, it
was true, but Charles had enough for both, and they were wise enough to give full weight connections. They were anxious that
Charles should marry, and for him to have singled Georgina Sackville out from among girls would at once have entitled her to
no ordinary place in their regard; but her own sweet smiles and winning ways were her still more effectual advocates. Georgie
couldn’t help being pleasant with the Elleses even, whom she didn’t the least care about—she was a trifle too ready, perhaps,
to give of her smiles to all who came. Mrs. Elles thought she should like her about her when she was ill, Mr. Elles thought her
singing of an evening when he was half asleep would be vastly agreeable, and they both considered that her beauty and grace
was the very roc’s egg wanted to complete the perfection of their suburban palace now in process of erection.
</p>
<p>
But though Charles was very sincerely and properly in love, it was no such easy thing to screw his courage up to the sticking
point to induce him to put his fate to the touch. He would go to church and look at her instead of his prayer-book, and stare
and peep at her from behind plateaux of flowers in a very uncomfortable and embarrassing sort of way, and went so far as to
send bouquets whenever there was the faintest imaginable excuse for bouquets; but he didn’t like to trust himself to a distinct
declaration of his sentiments. He would wait for a favourable opportunity, and he had got no further than this when Georgie was
sent so precipitately down into Wales, without his having the least idea of the why or wherefore. He didn’t think he should
have missed her as much as he had done—that the not seeing her twice or thrice a week could have made so very much of
difference to him. Last night she had been in church again for the first time, and he had thought her looking altered—paler,
thinner than of yore. It had gone to his heart that, and a strange qualm of jealousy also had seized him with regard to Hepburn
sitting there beside her.
</p>
<p>
Going straight home, he had been seized upon in his discomposure by his mother; and she strongly urging upon him the
desirability of knowing at once the best or worst of things, he had found himself in half-an-hour’s time with a quire of his
mamma’s best note paper in front of him, biting the end of his pen, and looking helplessly up at the gaselier for inspiration.
He consumed a great many sheets of the paper without being able to produce anything at all satisfactory, and at last, having in
the process grown a good deal calmer, he concluded to go to bed now and do it the first thing to-morrow morning.
</p>
<p>
However, when to-morrow morning came, to write to Georgina Sackville was one of the last things he felt inclined to do, and the
utmost concession that his mother could with tears obtain from him was permission to ascertain through Mrs. Sackville’s
maternal intervention the exact state of the young lady’s feelings.
</p>
<p>
This mission Mrs. Elles undertook with readiness, and in her conference with Mrs. Sackville was careful so to enlarge upon the
letter of her instructions, as to render it now a matter of impossibility for Charles to draw back, if even he should be so
desirous.
</p>
<p>
Poor Mrs. Sackville found herself in a very perplexing situation. As the Spanish proverb says, “Heaven sends almonds to those
who have no teeth.” Three months ago to have had such a conversation with Mrs. Elles would have crowned her every wish, but of
what avail was it now? There was so little time, too, to consider whether candour or caution would be her best line of conduct.
But she soon found with regard to this no amount of deliberation would have availed her, for Mrs. Elles’ questions were so
exceedingly straightforward and to the purpose that nothing short of a downright fib could have helped her to parry them. She
was obliged to tell her nearly all the truth, whether she would or no. Of course she softened the Vane history as much as she
could, but she found, to her surprise, Mrs. Elles’ jealous apprehensions to be far more excited on behalf of Hepburn than
the Welshman.
</p>
<p>
The idea of Georgina’s ultimately preferring a trumpery Welsh farmer to her own handsome, much-to-be-desired Charles, was too
eminently ridiculous an idea to obtain upon her; nor did she indeed consider Hepburn seriously in the light of her son’s rival,
confessing herself uneasy merely as to the irritating effect of his constant presence upon the mind of Charles. She was for
having it settled off-hand one way or the other, and it was all Mrs. Sackville could do to prevent her accompanying her back
at once to hear from Georgie’s own lips the blushing, welcomed avowal she had taught herself to expect. Long and wearisome were
the arguments by which she was at length induced to view things as they really were, and to consult with Mrs. Sackville upon
the best plan of action under the circumstances. But when, she had once brought her mighty mind to bear upon the facts, she
had a plain, straightforward way of seeing things, calling a spade a spade—which is to my mind as much consonant with true
refinement as other ways with more pretension, and certainly expedites business.
</p>
<p>
“I see how you mean, my dear. I see what you’re driving at. You think missie would be more likely to take to my Charlie if she
didn’t see him till after she’d got over all this nonsense; and you think—and you think that young clerk with the beard, as
Charlie took on so about last night, will help her to forget him. Well, it may be so—I don’t know myself for certain—it’s
long since I was young, and I don’t go reading them foolish tales and magazines, for why, I can always bottom their stories
before the end of the first volume, beside living in a favoured land where the preciousest most beautiful tracts are offered to
you, at the corner of every public street, by the most benighted niggers with rings in their ears, and very little clothes to
speak of—as I say, it may be so; but take my advice, my dear, don’t go keeping the poultice on after the swelling’s gone
down,” concluded the good lady, whose similes had usually a medical origin.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Sackville was silent, and Mrs. Elles continued—
</p>
<p>
“Look ye here, my dear—you go off to some of them German baths, or the place where the Empress goes, only keep your eyes on
those rascally Popish priests, like cats in the dairy or a pleaceman in the area, Elles says they are. You go from one place
to another, it’ll do your rheumatism a power of good, and improve missie’s French accent, and Elles and I’ll find the
needful—nay, nay, no words, it’s our own affair. Why, bless my soul, Elles and I love the child as if she were our own, and
we’ll come over and see you and bring Charles, and it’ll all come right in the end you’ll see, only cheer up a bit, there’s
a dear.”
</p>
<p>
And after some further conversation and an osculatory performance, the two old ladies separated. And as Mrs. Elles commanded
so did Mrs. Sackville. She took the money humbly—nay, thankfully—that was offered her, and sought with her daughters in
foreign climes for a refuge from her many troubles.

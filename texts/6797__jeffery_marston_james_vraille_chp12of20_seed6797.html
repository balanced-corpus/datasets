<title>Chapter 12 of JAMES VRAILLE: THE STORY OF A LIFE by JEFFREY C. JEFFREY</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- CHAPTER 12.<br>THREE GENERATIONS -->
<p>Piccadilly had on its old yellow-and-brown winter suit, and looked so dowdy and dismal that the heavens were half inclined to cry over it, which would only have made matters worse. The road was muddy, the pavement greasy, everything and everybody damp. The fog was not so dense as to necessitate the supplementing of daylight with gaslight in order to see, but thick enough to make driving difficult, cabmen swear and policemen pretty busy.</p>
<p>The hoarse voices of itinerant vendors were huskier than ever that raw, unwholesome morning. People ran up against one another, and opened their mouths to apologise — if they did so at all — grudgingly, for fear of admitting the fog. The weather was not conducive to civility; and a tall man in an ulster, who strode along eastward with bent head and frowning brow, was no more polite than his neighbours. He was evidently a gentleman, but, quite as evidently, one who did not study personal appearances too minutely.</p>
<p>He reached the Burlington Arcade, up which he turned. In one of the shop-windows an assortment of photographs of “professional” celebrities had attracted the attention of a small crowd, and he, too, stopped to look.</p>
<p>“Very beautiful, no doubt,” he said, and hurried on, for his remark had diverted the general gaze from the window to himself.</p>
<p>He did not stop again until he reached the Albany. Mr. Vraille was at home, and Major Vraille was admitted. </p>
<p>“Well, Jim, my boy, how are ye this beastly morning?” boomed Uncle Ben’s voice. “Looking a little better than when you first came up, eh? London done you good? — that’s right. Sit down, boy, sit down, and let’s have a chat.”</p>
<p>Flinging off his coat, Vraille drew an arm-chair up to the fire. Changed as he was, his time-honoured designation remained the same. He was now in no sense a boy; his boyhood had left none of its boyishness behind, and, in spite of his short grey hair, he was far from approaching the “old boy” period of life. He looked sallow and thin, but he was “right as a trivet,” he said, “and as strong as a horse again.” Then he asked after the old gentleman’s health.</p>
<p>Now Uncle Ben was actually an old boy — an old boy whose life’s labour was over, whose rest had come in the shape of Albany Chambers and nothing to do. The office had been closed, not so much because the old lawyer had wearied of law, as on account of the law wearying of him.</p>
<p>“A good bit better than I have been,” he said. “and there’s not much the matter with me now, except the incurable complaint. Fogs don’t suit my time of life, that’s all. But what,” he asked, heartily enough, “have you been doing with yourself lately?”</p>
<p>“As much as most men in any given fortnight. I’ve seen everything said to be worth seeing in London — nearly all the theatres, and most of the music-halls; but farces are not so funny as they used to be, I think, and there seems to be more vulgarity and less wit about the popular songs of the day than ever.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps so,” said Uncle Ben; “I don’t know. Anything else?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes; I’ve dined out, lunched out, and supped out; I’ve been to an ‘at home’ or two, and if you throw in three or four concerts, a few picture-galleries and an oratorio, you have the lot.”</p>
<p>” I’m glad you’ve been enjoying yourself,” said Uncle Ben, slowly, as he offered his nephew a cigar.</p>
<p>“I did not say that. You asked me what I had been doing. The time that I haven’t spent with you has been spent as I say. Enjoyment! I’ve lost my capacity for enjoyment, I think. These things used to amuse me once — no, they never did! I was a fool to suppose they would now. You see, this place, St. Dogwells, where I am quartered, is a wretched place. I have read of the ‘dull apathy and sordid pettishness’ of small country towns, and that about describes St. Dogwells. It is worse than deadly — it is deadly-lively; the Dogwellites won’t let me alone. I came to London to enjoy myself; but it has been a failure. In spite of the loneliness of Fort Gaunt, I’d sooner spend my evenings night after night in my barrack-room alone, than spend them at the Slasher with the crew I met there yesterday. It seems a ridiculous thing to say, but sometimes I think I’d like to leave the service altogether and travel.”</p>
<p>The old man looked attentively at his nephew for some time without speaking, and then said —</p>
<p>“Light your cigar, my boy.”</p>
<p>Vraille lighted his cigar, and when he had puffed
it into a glow, continued —</p>
<p>“The spirit of unrest is upon me. When I’m at St. Dogwells I want to be in London, when I’m in London I want to go back. I’m naturally restless, I suppose. When I was in England I wished to be in India. Although I looked forward to coming home like anything, I think now I would go out again if I had the chance. We never know when we are well off, do we?”</p>
<p>“Jim,” said Uncle Ben, solemnly, taking his cigar from his mouth and waving it up and down impressively, “you are talking nonsense. Remember the old motto: ‘Know thyself.’ There never was a Yraille who did more credit to that motto than you did — up to a few months ago. Are you going to undo all you have done? No; you can’t do that. But I am sorry, boy, to hear you talk like this; all the more sorry because I know what you are made of, and that in the past you lived to prove —”</p>
<p>“I lived to see a paper thrust before a dying man, and a pen put into his hand too late! It was all vague and dreamy; I was too sick to know properly what was going on; but I remember thinking it would make her proud of me: Dr. Dick told me all about it afterwards, for I believe I was a bit off my head. Dare was sane enough, but he had put off signing that paper from day to day, saying he would see to it when he got well. He put it off too long; he died before he could write his name. My recommendation never got beyond the hospital walls. What did she care?”</p>
<p>“But every one knew of it.”</p>
<p>“Not every one — only a few. It was all represented afterwards; Dick took the matter up and pushed it forward. I had a letter from him this morning, saying it was hopelessly blocked — not that it matters much now.” </p>
<p>“But the honour is the same, Jim; the honour is
the same.”</p>
<p>“Honour!” he cried, springing to his feet and flinging out his arm as if he were going to deliver a speech upon the subject; — “don’t talk to me of honour, uncle.” There he stopped, and, seating himself again, said quite quietly, “But it’s a poor thing — easily won, easily lost; and not worth getting excited about.”</p>
<p>Then the lawyer, rather than the uncle, argued with him. He took the thing to heart altogether too absurdly; his case was common enough; he was to be congratulated on getting so well out of a bad bargain. All that remained to be done was to take the necessary steps to rid himself of a worse than useless encumbrance, and forget the past as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Jim sighed. That was such an easy thing to say — such an impossible thing to do. It seemed to him that in the future he would live in the past. He was lonely, and although he knew that he had always been lonely — forced back into himself — he regretted the past, and wished, not that it could be again, but that it were not irretrievably gone. It is so hard to leave behind any defined period of time — so hard to pass the milestones of life. No state of being is changed for another state without some regrets.</p>
<p>” All you say is true, uncle,” he said; “the past lies behind me, a wreck; the future is before me, but it is empty. There is the pity of it. Ah! for the boy’s sake, if not for mine, I wonder she did not stop to think. But I believe now she never cared a rap more for him than she did for me. No woman could care for me, perhaps — I am not that sort of man, most likely — but I thought all women loved their children. Uncle Ben,” he said with impressive earnestness, “I married one that didn’t.”</p>
<p>The lawyer did not seem particularly surprised at this revelation; but, after looking at his nephew for some time, with a light of admiration gradually kindling in his eyes, suddenly burst out with —</p>
<p>“Jim, you married a fool.”</p>
<p>“It is curious,” said Vraille, simply, “that before our marriage I should have told her that folly worked an infinity of mischief in the world. There is that man; she has done him as much harm almost as she has done me, if that were any consolation, which it isn’t. He had no idea she was going to join him, I verily believe; but as she claimed his protection, he, from some sense of <i>honour</i> which I do not pretend to understand, gave it to her; he lost a very desirable appointment in consequence, and his career is practically ruined. When I got her letter — that first day, you know — I wanted to go after her, indeed I did. She said I had driven her from me, and that she had gone to some one who was always kind. Oh! I thought I could pardon her folly; but when Judith showed me I was bent on a fool’s errand, when she had told me more — much more that I did not know till then — I knew that it would be useless, and — and I could not go. It is as well, perhaps, I did not. There is no knowing how it might have ended; but, anyway, the indignity, the disgrace, without a shadow of hope beyond, was more than I could bear. She had deceived and tricked me to the last; and if she was ever fond of any human being beside herself — which I doubt — she was fond of that man. She never was of me — never!”</p>
<p>“And in the meantime, remember you are tied to her.”</p>
<p>“She shall have her freedom; but what is the good of freedom to me? My life is broken up — wasted.”</p>
<p>“Jim, my boy,” said the old gentleman in an altered tone, getting up out of his chair and laying his hand on the other’s shoulder, “I am very sorry for you.”</p>
<p>“I can’t bear kindness,” said Jim, sinking his head into his hands; “speak to me as you were speaking just this minute — quietly and coolly — and I can tell you anything you want to know. But don’t be kind, if you wish me to talk sensibly.” He raised his head and dropped his hands. “I can read or hear,” he said, “of children starving unmoved and without seeming to care a rush; but when I am told that some one has brought them bread at last, that is what I cannot stand; that sort of thing, I mean. It is easier to bear harshness and cruelty and coldness than a kind word. Kindness finds out weakness. One kind word from Lucy — only one — would have gained my whole forgiveness. It never came. Go back and sit down again, Uncle Ben; be as you were before. I want to get hard and cold like the rest of the world — as a man should be. Don’t remind me of what I know you are; don’t be kind.”</p>
<p>“Poor old Jim!” said Uncle Ben. “Time will be kinder to you, boy, than ever I could hope to be.”</p>
<p>He walked away then to the other side of the room, and stood with his back to Jim, looking out of the window. The view was limited to a few square yards of bricks and mortar; but little as there was to be seen, be probably saw less: for he stood there with vacant eyes, tapping one of his waistcoat buttons with the gold rim of his <i>pince-nez</i>, and softly hissing rather than whistling a little tune with his lips. Presently he left off hissing, and fixing his <i>pince-nez</i> securely in position, craned his head down sideways against the window-pane, and looked up open-mouthed at the sky. The fog appeared to be lifting, and a certain brightness in the heavy atmosphere seemed to hint that the afternoon would not be altogether so dismal as the morning had been.</p>
<p>“I believe it’s going to clear,” he said, turning round and wriggling his nose free of the spring of his glasses, which he caught deftly in his hand as they fell. “Have you anything particular to do?”</p>
<p>“No, nothing particular,” said Jim, who with his hands in his pockets, his legs stretched out, his chin on his chest, sat looking at the fire; then, rousing up — “only to see the boy this afternoon. I go back to St. Dogwells to-morrow, you know.”</p>
<p>“Well, what do you say to a bottle of claret at the Club? Then, if you like, we can go and see the boy together afterwards.”</p>
<p>To this arrangement Jim willingly assented; and when he had helped the old gentleman to struggle into a heavy far-lined coat, they were almost ready to start.</p>
<p>“Oh, by the way,” he exclaimed, “there is a letter for you, Jim. It was sent on here yesterday from the’ office. I put it on the table to give you when you came, and precious near forgot it. However, here it is.”</p>
<p>Vraille took the letter and looked at it listlessly. The envelope was large and square, the paper thick, the handwriting unknown to him; it was probably an offer to lend him money to any extent on the shortest notice and easiest terms. He received many such; and as his uncle’s office had been his business address while in India, he was neither interested nor surprised. Uncle Ben was waiting with his hand on the door, so, putting the letter in his pocket, he followed him into the street, and by the time they had reached the staid old club of which Mr. Yraille was a respected member, had forgotten it altogether.</p>
<p>“I have been thinking,” said Uncle Ben. sipping his claret and smacking his lips between each sip, “that in your place I should be inclined to take that boy with me to St. Dogwells. Why don’t you? He’d be a companion.”</p>
<p>“Well, I have thought of it sometimes,” said Jim; “but then — oh, I don’t know; it would be a curious sort of anomaly, wouldn’t it — a man of my age with a baby and no wife in a place like that? No one down there has the least idea I am married. I am a sort of fraud, you see; I can’t give out I am a widower, I can’t say I am anything, and I thought I’d wait and let — let newspaper correspondents answer awkward questions for me first.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Flight does not care about children, Jim, and you can’t expect to leave him there for ever.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Jim, thoughtfully, “and it was awfully good of her to take him at all. ‘Pon my word,” he continued with a curious smile, the first indication of amusement his face had shown that day, “it would be rather fun to take him to St. Dogwells. Lord, how they would cackle and jaw!”</p>
<p>“But apart from that, I thought you were fond of the boy.”</p>
<p>“So I was, uncle; so I was — so I am now, but gall has been mixed with everything that used to be sweet and wholesome; it has poisoned all my thoughts and feelings. “When I go to Cabstand Square, there is the dreary remembrance of what Cabstand Square used to be; when I see the boy, I think of all that might have been, and is not, and never can be now. Oh! I detest Cabstand Square, and, kind as Mrs. Flight always is to me, I hate going there. The boy will soon forget me altogether.”</p>
<p>The good understanding which had existed between father and son in those past Simla days had been rudely broken, and for weeks afterwards Jim had scarcely seen his child. On the voyage home, his opportunities of improving their acquaintance had not been numerous, and shortly after landing, he had been ordered to Fort Gaunt, St. Dogwells. So that circumstances had rather tended to estrange big and little Jim. The situation now was awkward; Mrs. Flight had expressed a strong desire to make some reparation for the injury she said she had done him in allowing him to marry her daughter, whom she declared, in somewhat forcible terms, she would never see again, and had insisted on Judith and little Jim making Cabstand Square their home until her son-in-law was settled. Vraille had no option but to comply, and the matter once arranged, Mrs. Flight requested that Lucy’s name might never again be mentioned in her hearing. His occasional visits to Cabstand Square were, consequently, rendered somewhat perfunctory, and his interviews with Mrs. Flight constrained. Whenever he could he avoided her altogether, and confined his attentions to Judith and little Jim. The Irish Question, Free Trade, Universal Franchise, and such like matters, did not interest him much just then; and he knew that, although Mrs. Flight was civility itself, she cared more for a pungent diatribe on Mr. Gladstone’s latest transgression than for all the babies in the world. It was Judith Foresight whom he went to see, for little Jim’s welfare, he felt pretty certain, was left almost entirely in her bands. But not so altogether; for Uncle Ben had volunteered, with much show of importance, to take upon himself the responsibilities of general supervision in his nephew’s absence. And so thoroughly had the old gentleman entered into the spirit of this duty, so serious had he considered his obligations, that he had never allowed more than a couple of days to pass without making a personal inspection of little Jim’s nursery. On the few occations when he had failed in this respect, confined to his bed by the doctor’s orders, be bad invariably sent his man-servant with messages for Judith and paper bags for little Jim. These messages were just as useless as his visits, for he no more thought of giving directions than of finding fault, but they answered his purpose — whatever that was.</p>
<p>“Do you mind, uncle,” Jim asked as they descended the Club steps, “coming round by the Lowther Arcade? It is not much out of our way.”</p>
<p>The old gentleman exploded.</p>
<p>“Bless you,” he exclaimed, “I always go that way!”</p>
<p>So they proceeded to the Lowther Arcade, and there looked at the toys displayed on all sides, without either of them in the least knowing how to set about to choose — where choice was unlimited — what, out of so much, the boy would like best.</p>
<p>Uncle Ben, after a heated discussion with a young lady who wanted to force an air-gun upon him in spite of his objections to its danger, left her shop in dudgeon without buying anything, and repaired to another, which, as the proprietor remarked, he turned inside out before finally settling on a box of tin soldiers and a clock-work engine.</p>
<p>“All boys,” he said to Jim, “like soldiers and engines.”</p>
<p>“But don’t you think,” objected Vraille, “that he is rather too young to appreciate an engine? What do you say to this? “He touched a spring on the side of a square box he held in his hand. The lid opened, and the infuriated countenance of an aged man appeared with a squeak. Jim laughed.</p>
<p>“That!” cried Uncle Ben, indignantly. “I say it is enough to frighten any child into a fit.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps you’re right,” said Jim, meekly putting down the jack-in-the-hox, and, to appease the disappointed shopman, buying instead a dozen marbles.</p>
<p>“Well,” exclaimed Uncle Ben, as the marbles and their monetary equivalent changed hands, “you know less about this job than I do; engines come before marbles, anyway. I’ll have that engine now, in spite of what you say.”</p>
<p>So Uncle Ben made his purchase, and after rejecting a pair of skates, which the shopman said would come in handy if there was a frost, they moved off, discussing the possibilities of stabling a rocking-horse in little Jim’s nursery.</p>
<p>“I have it!” cried Jim, suddenly, when they had almost agreed to abandon the rocking-horse idea. “He was always fond of animals; a Noah’s Ark is the very thing.”</p>
<p>“Won’t he suck the paint off?” asked Uncle Ben with some anxiety.</p>
<p>“Humph!” said Jim, with a slowness due partly to doubt, partly to disappointment, “I did not think of that. But surely,” he added, brightening up, “surely there must be such a thing as an unpainted Ark.”</p>
<p>Uncle Ben was uncertain, and after making one or two inquiries without success, they agreed to take opposite sides of the Arcade and search independently for an unpainted Ark, inhabited by a similarly achromatic Noah and menagerie — the finder to be the possessor.</p>
<p>This arrangement answered excellently. Each was free to make any intermediate purchases he thought advisable without being subjected to adverse criticism from the other; and the two gentlemen met together at the end of the Arcade looking rather like a couple of animated Christmas-trees.</p>
<p>The unpainted Ark, which Jim had been lucky enough to secure, when wrapped in brown paper, made a rather formidable parcel. As the simplest method of carrying it, Major Vraille tied it to his stick, adjusting it so that it would balance a wooden horse at the other end.</p>
<p>“I think that’s all,” he said, straightening his back when his arrangements were completed.</p>
<p>The two men looked at one another and simultaneously burst out laughing.</p>
<p>“Uncle, what a generous old fellow you are!”</p>
<p>“What a fool you do look, Jim; come on!”</p>
<p>A four-wheeler took them to Cabstand Square. Mrs. Flight, they discovered, was not at home, so they requested the girl who opened the door to them to inform Mrs. Foresight of their arrival, ascended three flights of stairs, deposited their parcels in the little front room apportioned exclusively to Master Vraille as a sitting-room, and awaited the course of events. They had not long to wait.</p>
<p>“All right,” came Mrs. Foresight’s voice, sharp and clear, from the adjoining room, “sha’n’t be a minute. Say he’s ready all but his ‘air.”</p>
<p>The girl said nothing of the sort — there was no need — but before her footfall was out of hearing, Judith appeared with little Jim in her arms.</p>
<p>She set him on the floor.</p>
<p>“Now, make your bow like a little gentleman,” she said.</p>
<p>The little figure (quite two feet of it now) bent forward and down until the little hands touched the toes of a pair of tiny shoes, and a small voice, rendered husky by intervening linen, said —</p>
<p>“Mornin’, daddee!”</p>
<p>“Bravo!” shouted Uncle Ben.</p>
<p>“There’s a good boy,” said Vraille.</p>
<p>“Yes, but get up again,” said Judith.</p>
<p>But Master Jim’s fingers, once brought into the near proximity of brand-new red shoes, could not be so easily recalled; they wandered over the shiny leather and plucked at the confining buttons as if desirous of unfastening them.</p>
<p>“No, no,” said Judith, “stand up again, like a man. He allus does spoil his tricks afore company,” she added regretfully.</p>
<p>He stood up straight with a jerk, and holding out one foot to his visitors, said —</p>
<p>“Noo ‘oos, ‘ook! Boy got noo —” staggered, and fell with a sudden flop into a sitting position. “Boy cummle down ‘gain,” he explained, with a look of mingled astonishment and distress on his upturned face.</p>
<p>“So you did. Well, never mind, old chap,” cried Jim, picking him up in his arms. “Come and see what Uncle Ben has brought.”</p>
<p>Uncle Ben, meanwhile, had unpacked a drum, and was playing it and a penny whistle with as much earnestness as any Punch-and-Judy showman.</p>
<p>“‘Ant it t’umpet,” said the boy, holding out his arms.</p>
<p>“He will put in them <i>its</i>” Judith explained apologetically as Uncle Ben handed the boy the musical instrument which his childish credulity helieved to be a trumpet.</p>
<p>After a few shrill blasts, he dropped the whistle unceremoniously, and, struggling violently in Jim’s arms, excitedly remarked, “‘Ant it d’um, ‘ant it d’um?”</p>
<p>Then Vraille set the boy down on the floor beside the drum, and picking up the penny whistle, played a dismal and dolorous tune to his son’s accompaniment, while Uncle Ben, not to be outdone, produced a rattle, which he swung round and round as well as his boisterous laughter would allow him.</p>
<p>The boy’s delight was unbounded; he hovered between a box of bricks and an india-rubber ball, holding a sword in one hand and a glass marble in the other, quite unable to determine which treasure demanded the greater share of his attention. He was somewhat bewildered with his wealth, and any <i>woman</i> of sense would have known that one toy would have amused him more than a dozen. Judith, indeed, did protest mildly against the variety of attractions, saying that it was enough to turn his brain; but Uncle Ben laughed at her fears.</p>
<p>“Not a bit of it,” he declared ; “let him have the whole blessed lot, and choose what he likes best.”</p>
<p>If the boy’s joy was a little too ecstatic for his happiness to be absolutely perfect, the pleasure he conferred on his two visitors was unalloyed. With his hands and mind equally full, his eyes wide open, and his legs wide apart, he tottered or tumbled from one thing to the next, and habbled incessantly about all he saw.</p>
<p>“Lord, how happy he is, and how he talks! “cried Uncle Ben, delightedly. “I can’t understand one half he says,” he continued; “and it seems to me, Mrs. Foresight” — he was always very polite to Judith — “that he learns more in twenty-four hours than I do in a week. I can’t keep up with him.”</p>
<p>” Aye, he’s pretty quick, sir, bless his ‘eart,” said Judith.</p>
<p>“Everything is a lesson to him,” said Jim, picking him up after another “cummle down”; “everything is new and full of interest. It is all future with him, if he only knew it, poor little beggar; but he has no fear, no anxiety; and, in the past, no regrets: he just lives in the absolute present. No wonder he learns quickly. You cannot detect the mark of a pin-prick on a printed page, uncle, but it is pretty apparent on a clean sheet of paper.”</p>
<p>“Just so,” Mr. Yraille replied, his whole attention absorbed in the winding-up of a top.</p>
<p>Vraille watched the noisy top as it banged up against the legs of the chairs and tables, recoiled from one collision on to another, whizzed from danger to danger — doomed, apparently, to self-destruction — escaped with a dent or two, circled, steadied itself, hummed peacefully in a ruck in the carpet, wobbled, received its quietus at the child’s hands, and lay upon its side — dead. Why, his own life had been like that; and now it, too, had settled into a rut. How would it end? But, meanwhile, was it affording the boy gratification? Had he, of late, been neglecting him? No; lie came to see him whenever he could; but was that enough? “Was duty alone likely to win the love of that happy little heart? Had gloomy thoughts excluded others which might have been productive of pleasure in the little fellow’s rather dreary life, and in his own, where he had found pleasure so hard to produce? Was it possible that that busy little mind, so quick to appreciate, so keen to discern, so incapable of reasoning, had recognised a change of manner, and felt, though it could not understand, his selfishness?</p>
<p>As he sat asking himself these questions, the boy was lashing Uncle Ben’s legs with a whip, and chuckling at the old gentleman’s contortions of affected fright. Every one, Judith even, was laughing; he alone was moody and pre-occupied, wishing somehow that his legs, instead of Uncle Ben’s, were being lashed.</p>
<p>Master Jim soon tired of the whip, and, espying a glass marble on the floor, evinced as much surprise as if he had seen it for the first instead of the twentieth time that afternoon.</p>
<p>“Ickle bailee,” he said, holding it in the palm of one chubby hand, while he called Uncle Ben’s attention to it with all the fingers of the other. As there was no sort of finality about his own surprise, why should there be about Uncle Ben’s? Apparently there was not. The old gentleman had seen that marble more often than even little Jim himself, yet when it was shown to him again, he evinced as much astonishment as he would have done had Ranieses the First suddenly walked into the room.</p>
<p>“God bless my soul!” he exclaimed, giving a great jump, and holding up both hands, palms outward, as be scrutinised the discovery. “Well, that <i>is</i> a marble, and no mistake; wherever did you find that now?” </p>
<p>Little Jim looked up at him for a moment with the wondering expression he always wore when questioned, and then said slowly —</p>
<p>“T’umpet, blow t’umpet ‘gain ” — (“Please,” from Judith) — “p’ease, Unkoo Ben.”</p>
<p>So the old gentleman set to work again on the penny whistle, and blew lustily, until he suddenly exclaimed —</p>
<p>“Why, Jim, we’ve clean forgot the Ark!”</p>
<p>This was true. In the excitement of the hour, and amid the general confusion, the Ark, that had given them so much trouble to find, had been overlooked, and still remained “done up” in its brown paper and string.</p>
<p>Its success, when placed in front of the boy, was at once apparent; he ceased to talk. Silently he sat beside it, picking out the animals one by one until the Ark was empty, and then as silently putting them all back again, not two by two according to tradition, but each one by itself, with the greatest possible care and deliberation. This operation was repeated in solemn silence, but then the recognition of old familiar forms set in with forcible expressions of welcome. All his old friends were there, and he greeted each in turn; but the recipient of his loudest acclamations of delight was a certain hybrid chanticleer crossed with turkey blood, which he called a “cockey.”</p>
<p>The Ark, and especially the cockey, had won the day, and somehow the father of the boy felt glad.</p>
<p>When the time of departure arrived, the cockey was still clasped to the boy’s heart. He watched without a murmur of complaint all the other toys being packed away into a cupboard; he saw the animals stowed into the Ark without a protest; but when they tried to take the cockey from him, he burst into a flood of tears, and, like the dove in the old story, the cock remained outside.</p>
<p>Uncle Ben struggled into his coat again, and after bidding the boy a boisterous farewell, stepped into the passage with a wink of meaning at his nephew.</p>
<p>Jim in his heart thanked him for his forethought, for he had some private business to transact with Judith. It was soon over, and then he said —</p>
<p>“Judith, if I took the boy to live with me down at St. Dogwells, would you come? I tell you fairly it is an infernal hole.”</p>
<p>“Sir,” said the wooden woman, “where he goes, I goes; until I’m told by you I ain’t wanted no more.”</p>
<p>“I shall never be able to repay your devotion, Judith.”</p>
<p>“He pays me ten times over, thank you, sir — to say nothing o’ your kindness.”</p>
<p>“You are a good woman,” he said.</p>
<p>“I hopes so, sir.”</p>
<p>“Look here,” said Uncle Ben, putting his head in at the door, “when you’ve finished with Mrs. Foresight,  want her here a moment.”</p>
<p>“I’ve finished with her now.” He took the child from her arms, bidding her go and see what Mr. Vraille wanted. She left the door ajar as she passed out of the room, but he was practically alone with his son.</p>
<p>There was a yearning look in his eyes as he stroked the flaxen cnrls and tried with gentle touch to turn the boy’s averted face toward his own. But little Jim was not thinking of him, nor, for the moment, of the wooden bird he clutched so tightly in his hand; his whole attention was concentrated on the door. “Lalla gone,” he said anxiously, and with indications of rising tears. </p>
<p>“Never mind her for one little moment, my boy — my own boy. Look at me — so. Now say ‘Daddee dear’ just once to please me.”</p>
<p>” Daddee de-ar,” the child repeated slowly.</p>
<p>“He’s going away, little chap, right away — don’t struggle so, he’ll soon be gone. Will you kiss him once before he goes?”</p>
<p>The rosy lips formed themselves into a pout, shyly touched his sallow cheek with their sweet softness, an opened in a gentle kiss.</p>
<p>“My darling boy ! we will be all the world to one another from this day forth. We promise it — don’t we?” </p>
<p>“Zes,” said little Jim, beginning to look very miserable, and with his eyes fixed on the door again. Alas! he knew not what he said.</p>
<p>He knew what he wanted, though. “Lal-la !” he shouted with a wail, and Judith came.</p>
<p>“Oh, sir,” she said, “jus’ look at this. Mr. Vraille has given it me for gownds, an’ won’t listen to a word I says.”</p>
<p>Vraille caught sight of a fluttering bank-note as he thrust the child into her arms, and with a hasty word of farewell hurried from the room.</p>
<p>He found his uncle in the drawing-room talking to Mrs. Flight, who had that minute returned home after an apparently successful raid upon the bookstalls, for she sat beside an open parcel of magazines and papers cutting the leaves of a new <i>Nineteenth Century</i>. “Oh, I like to read both sides of the question,” she was saying, “and this is about the only periodical nowadays that gives him a chance of ventilating his mistaken —”Well, Jim, how are you? How’s the boy?”</p>
<p>Late as it was, she insisted on their staying for “a cup of tea and a chat,” and would listen to no excuses. “It is not often,” she said, “that I get the chance of talking to intelligent people — they are so shockingly scarce.”</p>
<p>So they sat down and sipped her tea; and Uncle Ben, at least, indulged her to the top of her bent. He and the sprightly little old lady were soon immersed in an argument in which little by little Uncle Ben appeared to get out of his depth. But Jim did not pay much attention to what they were saying; he was thinking of the child upstairs, now probably asleep; thinking how thoroughly contented people with hobbies were, even though they lived alone, and wondering if he too would be happy down at Fort Gaunt if he had something interesting to absorb his whole mind, something, that would take him out of himself — the child for instance.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Flight had more or less reconstructed the British Constitution and placed it upon a new and sounder basis, they rose to go. Uncle Ben somewhat hurriedly made his escape from the room, but Jim lingered behind to tell her, with many expressions of gratitude for her past kindness to his boy, that he thought of transplanting him to St. Dogwells. She received the information with composure, but assured him that the child was no trouble to her, and that she was willing to keep him as long as Jim pleased.</p>
<p>“You have been awfully good to him as it is,” he said in conclusion, “and I know you would do what you say, but the fact is, I think I should like to have him.”</p>
<p>“And he’d be happier with you than here, that’s the truth,” she burst out. “I’m a selfish old woman, and don’t pretend to care about children, but he’ll learn to love you and be a comfort to you perhaps. The least that I could do was to give your child a home. I’d do more — more for you than that, if I knew how. I wished to make you reparation; but I fear reparation is impossible. Look here, Jim; I never mention the subject, because I hate the thought of it, but your marriage ought never to have taken place — she was not worthy of you, Jim; I knew it — not so well then as I do now — but still I knew it, and I behaved badly in allowing you to throw yourself away upon her.”</p>
<p>“Don’t think that,” he said; “it would have made no difference.”</p>
<p>“I suppose not,” she said, looking up into his face. “Oh! she was a fool — a fool — a fool! I hate a fool. There, I’ve said my say. Grood-bye.”</p>
<p>She had meant kindly, and he knew it, but still, as Jim descended the stairs, he could not help feeling that he had no one in the world, except Uncle Ben, to look to for sympathy apart from pity; that his troubles would in time become a nuisance to other people; that his boy was not really wanted, and that in the future they would have to look to one another for everything.</p>
<p>“Uncle,” he said, when he and the old gentleman had walked a little way along the street in silence, “I think I’d better take that boy down to St. Dogwells.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it’s right he should go,” Uncle Ben replied reflectively, “but his going will leave a hole in my life, already as full of holes as a fishing-net.”</p>
<p>It was late when they separated that night after their quiet little dinner at the Albany. They had discussed many things, and Major Vraille, as he walked home to his hotel, had much upon his mind.</p>
<p>“It all has to be done,” he said to himself as he stood before his dressing-table winding up his watch, “and it may as well be done at once;” and he began to empty his pockets preparatory to undressing. From one of them he drew out an unopened letter. With a gesture, partly of sudden recollection, partly of impatience, he tore it open.</p>
<p>A glance at its contents assured him that it was from no money-lender. It was a long letter, neatly written on thick black-edged note-paper, and the handwriting was clear and characteristic-looking. Sitting down, he drew a candle towards him and began to read. It bore an address he had never heard of, and commenced in the usual way, “Dear Major Vraille”: —</p>
<p>“Perhaps you have quite forgotten my existence. I was quite young when you knew me in England, and since then I have only had the pleasure of meeting you once — in India, a little more than a year ago, at a dinner-party. But my name will at once tell you who I am, and why I am writing to you.”</p>
<p>He read thus far with weary indifference, aud yawned as he turned over the sheets to find out the name of his unknown correspondent. He was tired and wanted to go to bed, and the rest of the long-winded epistle — a request for a loan, or whatever it was — would then very well wait until the morning. But the signature, when he had found it, made him turn back to the first page again and read on: —</p>
<p>“The settlement of my poor father’s affairs all devolved upon me — indeed, I was almost the only relation he had when he died — and although I have had to do many things that would have been better done by a brother or a son, I cannot help feeling glad that, with the rest, this duty and pleasure of writing to you has fallen to me and to no one else.</p>
<p>“I left India soon after hearing the news of his death, but until I came home (to England, I mean, for this is not my home) no details reached me; and even then I did not know of the great debt of gratitude I owed you. But, some time ago now, I received a sealed packet of letters and papers, which had been travelling about after me from address to address, and then I knew all.”</p>
<p>Vraille here turned the page. The writing was now a little more hurried and the style less precise. It seemed that there lay between the lines the record of a struggle between emotion and propriety: —</p>
<p>“Among those papers I found a long official letter describing an attack on a convoy and the brave action that saved my father’s life. It lies before me as I write, and every word of its cold, official language tells me of your gallantry. Even official language cannot detract from it, although it seems to try to, by detailing all you did as so many facts without comment or emphasis. But perhaps it is best so; they are facts that speak for themselves; no mere words could improve them, though circumstances might, and did.”</p>
<p>Then the writer became very complimentary and slightly incoherent; but Major Yraille understood and blushed. He had never been addressed in quite the same way before.</p>
<p>“Oh, I should like,” she said, “to be the man who had done those things! I should be so proud if he were a relation of mine. Some day I hope I may meet him, and give him my thanks personally, instead of writing them in a letter which seems to fall so far short of what I think and all I would wish to say.”</p>
<p>She went on to explain that her opportunities of seeing newspapers had not been many of late, and supposed that she had thus missed seeing the notification of his “honours.” Her congratulations concluded in the remark, “And please believe me when I say that I am glad to think it was my own father who recommended you for your Victoria Cross. This copy of his letter is unsigned and not in his handwriting, but the heading states that it is from him to the General he was serving under at the time, and I shall keep it all my life, and value it almost as much as if it were the original.”</p>
<p>At this point Vraille laid her letter down. How did she get that paper? Had it been put amongst her father’s private letters by mistake, or had some one sent it to her purposely? He wished she had never seen it; and yet — well, there was no harm done after all; he could easily write and explain. He went on with his reading.</p>
<p>There was very little more — a few commonplaces, and apologies for not having written before, and the letter concluded with —</p>
<p>“I am living with a country family, far away from Army Lists and military people, and had almost despaired of finding out where you were, when I remembered your having mentioned an uncle, a solicitor, that night at dinner. I managed to get hold of a London Directory, and as there was only one lawyer of the name, am sending this to his address. I should like to know that it has reached you; it would take a weight off my mind.</p>
<p>“With kind regards to Mrs. Vraille, believe me,<br>
“Yours gratefully and sincerely,<br>
“Edith Dare.”</p>

<!--chapter title: The Ace of Hearts-->

<p>I was just starting my professional
career, and it was necessary to secure
a convenient office. I did not want anything
pretentious—an office for myself and
a small ante-chamber for the boy whom I
engaged as clerk of all work would amply
suit my requirements. I had served my
articles with an old-established firm of
solicitors in the city, and had been accustomed
to great rooms filled with calf-bound
volumes and shelves of ancient parchment,
and I laughed to think of the difference
there must be between the little office I had
in my mind’s eye and the big place where
I had learned my law. Nevertheless I was
well content to make a small beginning,
and to trust to the future for bringing me
an increase of business and of fortune.</p>

<p>Perhaps because I had two or three professional
friends thereabouts, I selected Holborn
as being a likely spot wherein to pitch
my tent. After a good deal of looking
about me, I decided to apply to an agent,
with whom I went to inspect a place he
recommended, a third floor of Parchment
Buildings.</p>

<p>“Here you are, sir,” said the agent, unlocking
the door of the office on the third
floor. “This is a sort of clerk’s office; the
principal room is beyond it, and looks out
into Parchment Passage, as I told you. Nice
situation this, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>I walked in and inspected both rooms
before answering him. As regarded size
and situation they were certainly all that
I wanted. The outer office would do very
well for my boy-clerk, and the inner would
suit me. Nevertheless it was evident that
a good deal of cleaning would have to be
done before anybody could tenant either
room. Two years at least had passed since
the rooms were placed on the agent’s books.</p>

<p>I said that the rooms would suit me, providing
that the rent was not excessive.
Therewith we fell a-bargaining, and eventually
hit on terms which met my approval.
A week later I was in full occupancy of my
offices. My boy-clerk sat at a little desk in
the outer office and pretended to work very
hard, while I sat at a big desk in my own
sanctum and read law. There was really
little else to do in those early days. I sent
in my office appointments, and spent two or
three days in seeing them put straight.
Wanting some place in which to store a
quantity of old books and papers, I had a
cupboard cleared of a quantity of rubbish
evidently left there by the last tenant. It
contained a vast amount of old letters, invoices,
and papers, but these had been torn
into small scraps and thrown into a corner.
The woman who cleaned my rooms complained
a good deal about the mess caused
by these scraps of paper.</p>

<p>In reply to my inquiries, the woman told
me that it would be about three years since
the rooms had been occupied. Further interrogated,
she said that she could not
remember the last tenant’s name; it was
something foreign, and she did not know
how to pronounce it. She did not know
what his business was. He was always
writing, she said, and sometimes had other
foreigners to see him. His name was never
painted up on the door of his rooms nor on
the lintel down below, and it was her belief
that he was no good because he kept himself
so quiet. While the woman talked she was
engaged in removing the mass of torn and
scattered paper from the cupboard. Suddenly
she detached something from the contents
of her basket and handed it to me.</p>

<p>“He got that the very day he went
away,” said she. “For I remember going
down and fetching his letters from the box
in the hall below. The first thing he took
out of ‘em was that there card, and he laid
it down on his desk and stared at it like as
if he couldn’t make it out. That’s it, sure
enough; though I ain’t never set eyes on it
since. ‘Spect he chucked it away with this
heap o’ letters and papers.”</p>

<p>I took the thing from her and looked at
it. It was one of a pack of cards, the Ace
of Hearts, and would have attracted no attention
from anybody but for one slight fact.
Through the crimson heart in the centre of
the white card some hand had drawn a
stiletto with scrupulous fidelity. I had to
look at it narrowly to make sure that the
stiletto had not been engraved with the red
heart. Engraved, however, it had not been,
the trace of the artist’s pencil was clear
enough.</p>

<p>I took possession of the card and put it
aside. During the somewhat lazy time
which followed I often looked at it and
wondered what it signified. I could not
help fancying that it had conveyed some
sinister message to the man who had occupied
my rooms three years previously.
Certainly he had left his chambers hurriedly,
immediately after the receipt of it.
I came to the conclusion that my predecessor
in the offices in Parchment Passage had
been engaged in some mysterious transactions
of a not altogether safe nature, and
had been warned to go elsewhere by the
transfixed Ace of Hearts.</p>

<p>It was spring when I entered into occupancy
of my office, and the year went by
very quietly until winter set in. My practice
had been remarkably limited at first, but as
the months went by I obtained an increase
of work, and had less time to spend in reading
my calf-bound volumes. The first day
of December brought me a case which promised
to produce something considerable, and
I remained late and went on reading until
a slight sound on the landing outside made
me look up, only to catch sight of the clock,
which indicated a late hour of the evening.</p>

<p>Lifting the lamp from my desk I made
my way to the door and suddenly flung it
open. Then I started with amazement, for
there on the landing before me, his face
and figure clearly seen in the lamplight,
stood a man, tattered, sickly-looking, and
more disconcerted than myself. A man of
middle age apparently, and showing more
than usual signs of wear and tear at that;
for his dark hair was plentifully shot with
gray, and his pallid face was deeply lined
and seamed. My first glance at him showed
me two things—that he was a foreigner and
in want.</p>

<p>I was so much astonished at the sight of
this unexpected visitor that I stood staring
at him for a minute or two. He, on his
part, stood staring at me. At last I found
my tongue.</p>

<p>“Are you looking for some one?” said I,
lamely enough. “I don’t think you’ll find
any one in at this time.”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered. “No—at least I was
looking for you.”</p>

<p>“For me? Why?”</p>

<p>“Will you let me come in for a moment?”
he said. “Only for a moment, if you please.
Oh, there’s no need to be afraid of me. I’m
not dangerous, though I daresay I look so.”</p>

<p>I hesitated. He looked at me again, and
said quietly,—</p>

<p>“I used to live in these rooms.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said I, dimly comprehending that
the mysterious tenant stood before me.
“Come in.”</p>

<p>He followed me through the outer office
into my own room. When he saw the
cheery fire, the comfortable armchair by the
hearth, and the supper tray laid on the side-table,
he sighed. It struck me that perhaps
he was both cold and hungry, and I invited
him to eat. But at that he shook his head.</p>

<p>“I had better tell you what I want first,”
said he. “I have been on the stairs outside
for more than an’ hour wondering whether
you would allow me to enter this room.
You see I used to live here, and I left very
suddenly about three years ago. I daresay,”
he added, “the other people wondered why
I left so suddenly.”</p>

<p>I quietly opened the drawer of my desk in
which I had placed the mysterious Ace of
Hearts, and, drawing it forth, laid it before
him.</p>

<p>“Had that anything to do with it?” I
said.</p>

<p>He started to his feet as his eyes fell on
the card, and I saw great beads of perspiration
burst across his forehead under the
shock which the sight of the mysterious
emblem undoubtedly gave him. He looked
from it to me, and from me to the card
again; then he sighed heavily and sat
down.</p>

<p>“Where did you get that?” he asked
quietly.</p>

<p>“It was found amongst a heap of torn
papers which you, I think, had thrown into
the cupboard yonder. May I inquire what
this means?” I said. “Is it some signal, or
a warning, or a secret message? I suppose
it had a meaning for you at the time you
received it?”</p>

<p>“It had a meaning,” he answered. “It
meant that my life was not worth an hour’s
purchase—that I had been sentenced to
death—that the executioners were on my
track. I am a Russian, and familiar with
the doings of conspirators from my youth.
What I have just told you is true. I was
the agent of a secret society here. I offended
those in power. I was condemned; and
that’s the warning.”</p>

<p>“So you fled?”</p>

<p>“More fool I! I fled—to come back at
last as you see me. A beggar almost—
starving, homeless.”</p>

<p>Again I pressed him to eat. I was fascinated
by his story, and wished to hear
more.</p>

<p>“Not till I have told you why I came
here to-night. I came to recover something
that I left here when I fled. I left it because
I knew it was safe in the hiding-place I
had contrived for it. I was going I knew
not whither—possibly into rough places and
amongst desperate men. I came back here
to London at last, and a great longing came
over me to see it once more. That is why
I came to your door to-night, resolved to
ask you to admit me. The picture is here,
and I shall find it.”</p>

<p>He rose, and, crossing the room, approached
a corner of the floor, and carefully
removed the carpet which I had had
laid down. Lifting a loose board underneath,
he presently withdrew from the cavity a
parcel wrapped in many sheets of strong
paper, and came forward to the light
again.</p>

<p>“You did not know that you had this so
near you,” he said, blowing the dust away
from the parcel, and proceeding to unwind
the various wrappings. “And now, look!”
An exclamation of wonder and delight
burst from my lips. He held before me the
portrait of a young and lovely woman,
evidently the work of some great miniature
painter, and framed heavily in gold and
jewels. The frame must have been worth
a small fortune in itself, and yet I scarcely
noticed it, so beautiful was the face it contained.</p>

<p>The stranger held the picture from him,
and looked steadily at it in the lamplight.
Then he drew it nearer, and kissed the
face reverently.</p>

<p>“She is dead,” he said. “And she died
a martyr. She was born to all that the
world calls good; she died an exile and in
poverty. She was my sister.”</p>

<p>He restored the frame to its wrappings
and fastened it up again, and, rather against
my recommendation, placed it in its old
hiding-place. He refused my offer of supper,
and said he had no more to tell.</p>

<p>With that he bowed, shrugged his
shoulders, and went out. I followed him
to the head of the staircase, and watched
him descend. Then something prompted me
to open the window, and watch him leave
the house by the front door. He came out
and walked up the passage into Holborn. I
was about to shut the window and return
to my room, when I saw two men steal out
of a neighbouring doorway and follow my
visitor. So swift and stealthy were their
movements that I had no time to cry out
before they had vanished.</p>

<p>I locked up my office and went home,
much excited by the events of the evening.
I had never had an adventure of such a
startling description before, and had never
expected to find that my little shabby office
contained within it all the elements of a
romance. I went to bed, and could not
sleep for thinking of it. I was sorry by
that time that I had allowed my strange
visitor to leave the portrait in my room,
and I determined to do something towards
finding him and compelling him to remove
it.</p>

<p>I went to my office next morning by way
of Long Acre. Passing the corner of one
of the squalid streets leading towards Drury
Lane, I became aware of a small crowd of
people gathered outside a house, and doing
their best to obtain an entry thereto, despite
the presence of two or three burly policemen.
I went up, and, knowing one of the
latter, inquired the reason of the commotion.</p>

<p>“It’s a murder, sir,” said he. “And a
very rum murder it is too. Foreign chap
found in this here empty house, stabbed
through the heart. Like to go in, sir?
There’s the coroner’s Officer and the superintendent
inside just now. This way, sir.
Now then, make way there; this here
gentleman’s an official.”</p>

<p>I followed the man inside a small room
destitute of furniture. They had fetched a
bench from somewhere, and laid the dead
man on it. Somehow I was not surprised
when I saw him. I had felt certain from
the first that I was going to see my strange
visitor of the previous evening. And there
he lay before me, dead for many hours,
the doctor said, with a dagger driven into
his heart through a card, on which the Ace
of Hearts was still recognisable in spite of
the blood that had dyed it.</p>

<p>“A foreigner,” said the doctor. “This is
the work of some of those accursed secret
societies.”</p>

<p>I went on to my office. My boy met me
at the foot of the stairs with a scared look
on his face.</p>

<p>“If you please, sir,” said he, “I think
there’s been thieves in. The door was burst
open when I came with the key this morning.</p>

<p>I ran upstairs into my room. Everything
was in order there. I went straight to the
corner, and tore away the carpet and the
loose board, and examined the cavity beneath.
My hands met nothing. The portrait
was gone!</p>

<p>To say that I felt a strange sense of
alarm on finding the portrait, to which
recent events had attached such tragic
memories, was gone, is needless.</p>

<p>I thought it best to tell the police all I
knew. The ofiicials of Scotland Yard to
whom I unbosomed myself received my
story with interest, but not with surprise.
They were too well accustomed to the dark
methods and deeds of the secret societies,
whose members flee to London when the
greater Continental cities are forbidden them.
Nevertheless, my story did nothing to help
them. Indeed, I was told that the perpetrators
of these secret murders were seldom
found out.</p>

<p>Several months passed away. The cares
of business were beginning to press on me,
and I had little time in which to speculate
on the late mysterious events. I had my
first important case in hand, and it required
every moment and every thought. I was
glad when the courts rose and the long
vacation came to bring me a brief holiday.
I had won my case, and had gained no
small amount of present fame and future
gain by doing so. About the second week in
August I travelled down to Hull, and thence
took steamer to Stavanger for a month in
Norway. Coming back by the same route,
I found it necessary to stay a night in Hull;
and, as I had never been there before, I
spent the evening in looking round the
docks and quays of that ancient port.
There I came across a further link in this
remarkable story. Wandering along the
pavement of the quay which runs from the
town to the river, I paused to look in at the
window of one of those little dirty shops
where marine store dealers gather together
all manner of odds and ends, and what was
my surprise to see the portrait which had
once been hidden in my office!</p>

<p>I paused and looked again through the
dirty window. No, there was no doubt
about it; that was the portrait. The gold
frame was gone, and there were marks on
the edges of the picture which seemed to
indicate that it had been roughly removed.
The face, however, was unmistakable. I
had been too much struck by it at first
sight to forget its wonderful beauty.</p>

<p>On entering the shop a dirty-looking man,
evidently a foreigner, came forward from
some den in the rear, rubbing his hands,
and asking what he could do for me.</p>

<p>“Nothing particular,” I answered. “I just
wish to glance at your stock of curiosities.
I am rather fond of picking up rare articles.”</p>

<p>He answered that I was welcome to look
round, and went on to say that he had some
beautiful things in the way of binocular
glasses and chronometers if I was thinking
of taking a long voyage. While he chattered
volubly about his goods I was leaning over
the little partition which separated the shop
from the window, examining the portrait
from a better point of vantage. I had now
no doubt whatever as to its identity, and
determined to buy it at whatever cost.
After some haggling, I purchased the picture
and a Turkish dagger for one guinea.</p>

<p>When I reached the hotel I went up to
my room and examined the portrait carefully.
It was a small canvas, stretched on
a frame twelve inches by nine, and across
the back, probably with the idea of keeping
out dust and dirt, a stout piece of rough
canvas had been tightly stretched and
stitched. There was nothing to show that
any extraordinary history attached to the
picture. I returned to London and locked
up the portrait in my office safe.</p>

<p>Time went on, and as my practice increased,
I took more rooms in the house in
Parchment Passage. Some of them were
much more suitable for a private office than
the one in which the portrait had been hidden,
but I determined to remain in the latter,
and devote the others to my clerks. I had a
half-superstitious feeling that if ever the
mystery of the previous tenant came to be
solved, it would be in that room.</p>

<p>It was about two years after the murder,
and circumstances then required that I should
stay late at the office. I was engaged in
settling some difficult business with a client,
and he remained with me until half-past nine
o’clock. As I was about to turn out the
lamp which burned on my table, I heard
some one coming slowly up the stairs. I had
left the private door of my office open, and
could hear the sound distinctly. I turned up
the light again, and waited. At first I
thought the steps were those of my client,
who had possibly forgotten something and
was returning, but another moment told me
they were not. He was a young, active
man, likely to come up three steps at a
bound; the man now climbing the stairs was
evidently neither young or active, for he
came slowly and apparently with some
difficulty.</p>

<p>I went to the door and looked down at the
landing. The gas still burned there, and it
shone on the figure of a man who was climbing
the last flight of stairs. He was a tall,
well-built man of fine proportions, but something
about the stoop of his shoulders suggested
hardship and privation. I could see
very little of his face, but I noticed that his
beard, which was of unusual length, was
gray almost to whiteness. He seemed to be
well dressed, and I made up my mind that
his intentions were peaceful.</p>

<p>The stranger accosted me in very good
English. Somehow I had made up my mind
that he was a foreigner. After he had explained
his business, which was to find Alexis
Vitrefsky, of 3, Parchment Passage, a light
began to break in upon me. The man he
was in search of was the previous tenant!
Perhaps the mystery of the portrait was
about to be explained.</p>

<p>“Was the person you are in search of a
Russian?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he answered eagerly. “Certainly,
a Russian. A man of about my own
age, but perhaps younger in appearance. I
have had things to make me look old.”</p>

<p>“Will you come in a moment?” I said,
and led the way into my office. “Perhaps I
can give you some information.”</p>

<p>I gave him a chair, and he sat down. Now
that the lamp-light fell full on his face, I saw
that he was an extraordinarily handsome
man, and that evident suffering and privation
had not robbed him of his good looks.</p>

<p>“I shall be very grateful for any information
respecting Alexis,” said he. “And I
thank you in anticipation. Perhaps I ought
to tell you who I am. I am the Prince
Z—-“</p>

<p>He mentioned a name which made me stare
with astonishment. Prince Z— was an
escaped political prisoner, who, after spending
many years in the Siberian mines, had
escaped in a singularly daring fashion, and
had recently published a narrative of his
adventures and sufferings.</p>

<p>I sat down and told Prince Z— all that
I knew of Alexis Vitrefsky; how he had
suddenly left the very room in which we
were then sitting, and had returned to it two
years later under mysterious circumstances.
I told him of the events of that night; how
two men had watched Alexis leave my office,
and how the unfortunate man had been
murdered during the night, and the portrait
stolen from its hiding-place. He heard me
with anxiety and disturbance, and when I
told him that the portrait was gone, he rose
up and paced the floor in evident distress.</p>

<p>“Then I am indeed ruined! ” said he.</p>

<p>“Sir, that portrait meant everything to me.
It was indeed the property of Alexis, but its
possession meant more to me and to my
children than I can tell you. But I see you
do not understand me. With your permission,
I will narrate to you certain passages in
my sad history.”</p>

<p>I was half-tempted, on seeing his distress,
to tell him how strangely I had recovered the
portrait; but I refrained, remembering that
he might, after all, be an impostor, and that
it would be better for me to hear his story
before I told mine. I therefore begged him
to proceed.</p>

<p>“It is not a pleasant story,” said he, “that
I have to tell you. As you know, I am of the
new party in Russia. Since boyhood I have
worked, planned, and suffered for my country,
and in consequence I have been hated by
those in power. Until some years ago, however,
I was allowed to pursue my own course
in comparative freedom. Now and then the
police warned me that I was approaching
too near the line in my writings; but as I
happened to belong to one of the best families,
and was rich and powerful, I was practically
allowed to go my own way. At last, however,
I found that neither my noble name nor
my riches were to help me. Information
reached me that I was to be arrested and
severely dealt with. Fortunately I had been
somewhat prepared. My wife was in Paris;
my two young sons were at school in Germany.
I had secured to them a moderate
sum in case anything happened to me. I had
never dreamt that all I had would be confiscated.
Such, however, was to be the case,
according to my informant’s news, which
had come from the highest source. I was to
be stripped of land and goods and reduced to
beggary.</p>

<p>“I hurriedly consulted with Alexis Vitrefsky,
an old student-friend of mine, as to what
should be done. He was then unknown to
the authorities, and was about to start for a
tour in England. We went to an English
banker in St. Petersburg, and by his advice
I turned all my negotiable securities into
English notes. The good banker gave me
fifty English notes of a thousand pounds each
for my papers. These I handed to Alexis.
He was to carry them to England and preserve
them until I could join him. I was
watched, but I hoped to escape.</p>

<p>“Alexis was puzzled how to carry the
notes. If he had them about his person he
might be searched, and awkward questions
as to his right to them put to him. People
bound on a three months’ European tour do
not usually carry fifty thousand pounds’
worth of English notes with them. Alexis,
however, quickly solved the difficulty. It
was his practice to carry With him wherever
he went the portrait of his dead sister, whom
be regarded with feelings of absolute veneration.
She, like myself, had engaged in the
new movement, and she had suffered. Alexis
brought his cherished portrait, handsomely
mounted in gold, to my house. We placed
the notes behind the canvas, and stitched a
strong piece of coarse cloth across the frame,
so that none could see where the notes lay
hid. Knowing that Vitrefsky was my true
friend, and that he would take care of the
portrait, I felt my little fortune to be safe.</p>

<p>“Alexis left for England, and within a few
days of his departure I was arrested. I spent
some weary years in the fortress of St. Peter
and Paul; subsequently I was sent to the
mines. But before I left the fortress I had
news of Alexis. By means of those trusted
messengers who are to be met with even
amongst the government officials, he contrived
to send me a cipher letter, telling me
that he was living in London, and giving this
house as his address. Whenever I was free
I was to come here to receive the sum I had
entrusted to him.</p>

<p>“I have now told you all. I am free, and
I have come here, only to find that Alexis is
murdered and the portrait gone.”</p>

<p>I was so convinced that the prince was
telling me the truth, that I no longer hesitated
about handing the portrait over to him.
Before doing so, however, I asked him one
more question.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” I said, “but what of your
wife and boys?”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“My wife died during my imprisonment,”
he answered. “My boys are living here in
London. Poor lads, they had met with indifferent
treatment in Germany, and I fear
that they will find life hard, now that I have
no means of helping them.”</p>

<p>“Then your estates were confiscated?”</p>

<p>“Everything I had was confiscated. When
I finally escaped I was absolutely penniless.”</p>

<p>I went to my safe and took the portrait
from the drawer in whichI had placed it on
my return from Hull. Without saying a
word, I handed it to the prince, who received
it with an expression of the utmost astonishment.</p>

<p>“See if your money is still there,” said I.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt of it,” he answered, as
he cut away the stitches from the canvas
back. “But how did the picture come into
your possession? You told me it had been
stolen.”</p>

<p>I told him how I had found the portrait in
the shop at Hull, and had recognised it again.
While I talked, he turned back the canvas
and discovered the bank-notes securely
wrapped in folds of paper, exactly as he had
described. His delight at finding himself
once more wealthy was wonderful to witness.
“Poor Alexis!” he said, suddenly remembering
the friend to whom he had trusted his
sole resources. “I have my own theory as
to his death. I have heard that he became
closely connected with one of the more determined
secret societies, and had the ill-fortune
to break with certain of its most powerful
members. These people never forget. Alexis
was probably tracked down to the very last.”</p>

<p>“But the portrait?” I said. “Why should
the murderers steal that?”</p>

<p>The prince shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said he; “probably While Alexis
was conversing with you in here and showing
you the portrait and its valuable frame
the two men told off to kill him were watching
you. Of course they stole the portrait
for the sake of the frame.”</p>

<p>The explanation seemed a likely one. I
remembered that there had been nothing to
prevent Vitrefsky’s assassins from following
him up the stairs that night, or from listening
at the open door while he conversed with
me.</p>

<p>Prince Z— carried his bank-notes away
with him. He wished to reward me, saying
that but for me the money would have been
lost to him. The only reward I could consent
to take, however, was the picture. That
I kept, and still possess, a memento of what I
think a remarkable romance.</p>

<p>Prince Z— now resides permanently in
London, prematurely aged by the trials of
his past life, but undisturbed, as far as I
know, by government spies or the emissaries
of secret societies.</p>

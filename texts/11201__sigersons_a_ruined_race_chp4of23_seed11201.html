<!-- CHAPTER IV<br>DAN MAKES HIS COTTAGE IMPRUDENTLY TRIM AND PRETTY -->
<p>
In connection with the two large fields by the river, Dan MacManus had a comfortable roomy thatched cottage, and he spared no pains in preparing it for his bride. He left no chink or flaw in the thatch. No snow could be whiter than its walls. He even managed to get in a good sized window into one end, and instead of the usual manure heap in front, made a pretty flower garden, planting rose bushes and hollyhocks under the window, and a little trellis porch at the door. Nothing could be nice enough for the coming of his “queen.”
</p>
<p>
But, alas, her father, so far from being delighted, looked seriously at these adornments and improvements, and rubbed his poll without a smile.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you like the place?” enquired Dan with a slight misgiving of himself that he had made it look too well.
</p>
<p>
“Well, my boy, I don’t want to dash you, but ‘tis my opinion that your rint is high enough already. Mr. Jones did not begin at Fortmanus yet, but, they say, he’s coming to live beyant, There’s min coming down to do up the place, poor ould Mr. Nelligan left it all out of repairs, an’ whin ‘tis ready, he and his family are comin’ to live there.”
</p>
<p>
“I wondher, is it a sure thing?” said Dan, dejectedly.
</p>
<p>
“So I’m toult,” said Mike, with a shake of the head.
</p>
<p>
“Well, God be my protection, I’ll do my best, an’ I can do no more,” said Dan, trying to throw off the gloom which had settled down upon him.
</p>
<p>
However, he never flagged in his preparations, until all was completed, that was in his power to accomplish, and soon after, he brought home his happy, smiling bride.
</p>
<p>
The first months of their married life were supremely happy, though they were the cold dull months of mid-winter. The short days, whenever the weather permitted, were fully occupied in preparing the soil for the seed, and otherwise putting things in order for the spring. And the long dark evenings were bright as summer to them, in their snug little home, where walls as white as snow and every article that could bear a polish, smiled back the pleasant glow of the turf and bogwood fire.
</p>
<p>
With a contented heart, Dan went up to pay his first gale of rent to the new agent, but was considerably disappointed, when he found how he grumbled about it.
</p>
<p>
“I say, MacManus, you have your land absurdly cheap. You have some of the best land in the estate, down there, by the river. And those fields on the mountain side, are first rate for oats and potatoes. Really, you don’t pay anything like a reasonable rent. I’ll let it pass this gale, but I’ll have to raise it. Of course, it would be my wish to have you all as comfortable and well off as possible. But I must not forget my duty to Major Fortescue. His interests have not been considered at all on this estate. Indeed, it seems to have been very carelessly managed; and for that reason I have been placed over it, and I am bound to do my best!”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, sir, we are all bound to do our best for them that’s over us!”
</p>
<p>
Now, this was not a prudent answer for Dan to make, but a terrible shadow seemed to fall upon all his bright hopes, and knowing that there would be no use arguing about the rent, he could think of nothing better to say.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Jones thought he detected a sneer at himself, under the words, and, as he turned his eyes upon the newspaper which lay upon his desk without looking again at Dan, he thought to himself, “this lad must be kept in his place!”
</p>
<p>
A few days after, as he was standing on the steps of his own house, giving some orders to his man, Billy Finnigan, while he watched the blue smoke curling up from Dan’s cottage, which stood but a short way down the valley, he said: “That MacManus is a very fine young man!” Now, though his words were those of praise, yet his voice had another ring in it, and there was an unpleasant look in his eyes, both of which Billy instantly detected, and he answered accordingly:
</p>
<p>
“Troth he is, sir, an’ he knows it. I’m toult he’s wan o’ the ould stock, that owned the castle an’ the lands wanst.
</p>
<p>
“Pooh! pooh!” sneered Mr. Jones. “They’re all old stock about here, I think. He seems very well off, at all events.”
</p>
<p>
“Beautiful! sir, beautiful! sure ‘tis like a gentleman’s place he has below, an’ everything they can want at their hands, an’ I’m toult he was pricing a sidecar below at Mrs. Doyle’s, in Ballyvogue.”
</p>
<p>
“Well done!” exclaimed Mrs. Jones, who with her daughter Annie had turned up as usual when there was any gossip going.
</p>
<p>
“I think they’re awfully nice,” said Annie, “Mrs. MacManus gave me some lovely cream this morning.”
</p>
<p>
“What took you down there?” said her mother.
</p>
<p>
“Charley was hunting their geese, and I just ran down to stop him.”
</p>
<p>
“That wasn’t your place, dear, you should have come and told me — she must be very well off to be able to give you cream, ‘tis more than I could afford. She charges very high for her butter, at all events!”
</p>
<p>
“I think they’re both awfully nice!” repeated Annie.
</p>
<p>
Well of course, they’re a fine young couple, an’ I’ve nothing to say agin’ thim, but every wan should have their rights,” said Billy, casting a cunning glance at Mr. Jones.
</p>
<p>
The prospect of a rise in the rent did not damp Dan’s spirits much, for the season turned out well and promised nearly as fine a crop as last year’s. Until one evening that Mary sat outside the door of her cottage planning in her own mind a harvest merry making, when she observed Dan walking slowly and thoughtfully towards her. However, he smiled as he approached, but it seemed to be with an effort.
</p>
<p>
“There’s something wrong with you, Dan,” said she anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Och nothing worth while,” said he. “Mr. Jones was down looking at the crops.”
</p>
<p>
“Did he say anything about the rise?” said she.
</p>
<p>
“Sure I don’t suppose he manes to put five shillins an acre on the high fields, but he spoke o’ putting it on the fields below; begor if he puts it on all ‘twill be eight or nine pounds out of my pocket in the year, an’ ‘tisn’t very easy to spare that an’ buy seed an’ all, an’ there’s no use in getting that ould plough mended again; I couldn’t do it last year, but I was in hopes this year to get a proper wan. However, ‘tis only to do the same as I did. That ‘ont make very much differ, anyhow,” said he with a sigh, which seemed to mean more than a worn-out plough. Try as he would he could not throw off the gloom which hung over him all that evening, though Mary did her best to cheer him with a pleasant chat and all those endearing ways which came so easy to her sweet nature.
</p>
<p>
He went to bed with a troubled heart, and long after Mary had sunk into a calm sleep, he lay pondering and planning over the possibility of escape from a fateful future. “I know well there’s throuble before me,” sighed he, “an’ do my best ‘twill bate me in the long run. Oh, Mary, <em>avour neen ma chree</em>,<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> if ‘tis a thing I bring you to poverty an’ hunger in the end, what will I do at all? May God direct me.”
</p>
<p>
His worst fears were realized with regard to the rent, for Mr. Jones insisted on his paying the additional rent on all his land. In vain he explained to him how he had reclaimed those fields himself from the bare mountain side. Mr. Jones became only more indignant at his low rent, though he was at this time paying their full present value; and went off into raptures at their splendid aspect, and impressed upon Dan his determination to make something worth while out of this property, and vowed that the Major had been cheated up to the present. Complaints came from far and near. And many were the stories of the hard bargains he drove in other ways besides in rent, sometimes fancying a horse, sometimes a heifer, and using his position to get them at his own price. Many went to America who would gladly have ended their harmless simple lives on their own soil.
</p>
<p>
The next gale day passed, leaving Dan very ill prepared for the expenses of the coming spring. He needed certain additions to his soil to make up for two years of heavy crops taken from it. And he spoke of selling the high fields, but Mary would not hear of it, and racked her brain to find some other plan.
</p>
<p>
One evening, about this time, as she sat on a wooden seat outside her house, Mrs. Kinsella, Mrs. Jones’ cook, opened the wicket and entered the little garden. “Fine evening, Mrs. MacManus.”
</p>
<p>
“Very fine, thank God!” replied Mary, moving a little to make room at her side, for though Mrs. Kinsella had generally some excuse for coming, her chief business usually seemed to be to unbosom herslef to Mary on the “near” ways, &amp;c, of Mrs. Jones.
</p>
<p>
She sat down with a heavy sigh, “Well it bates me how the Missis can think so much of wan pound in the year an’ she promised it to me whin she was bringing me down to this unfortunate place from every kith an’ kin belonging to me. I have a great mind to lave her there an’ see how she’d be without me; an’ grand company comin’ next week that’ll bring heavy cookin’ an’ unregularity, an’ every other throuble.”
</p>
<p>
“Who’s coming?” enquired Mary, who was by no means exempt from the feminine imperfection of curiosity.
</p>
<p>
“Oh the highth o’ grandure, Sir Somebody an’ his lady, an’ she’s doing up the big bedroom in grand style for um. But the bed she has don’t plase her. Among all their grand things she hasn’t wan rale good feather bed.”
</p>
<p>
“Well if she hasn’t I have,” said Mary thoughtfully; “would she buy wan?”
</p>
<p>
“Like enough, but mind you you’ll have to keep to your price wid her, for she’s dhreadful mane.”
</p>
<p>
“Well you can tell her ‘tis wan that’s fit for the queen to lie on. We were gathering the feathers for many a month, an’ they’re like down, the finest o’ feathers is in it,” said Mary in a tone of sincere appreciation and not unmixed with regret.
</p>
<p>
The upshot of this conversation was that Mrs. Jones was down hot food before seven in the morning to see the bed; after much haggling she agreed to pay a sum considerably under its value, but to Mary’s disappointment said Mr. Jones would allow for it in the rent. To this Mary would not agree for, as she said, all their savings went to the rent, and they wanted the ready money to plant the land, &amp;c. Mrs. Jones went away highly offended at her “audacity,” as she said, in refusing. But she could not put the splendour of that bed out of her mind, and coveted it sorely. So rather than lose it, finding Mary obdurate, handed her the money, and had it quickly transferred to her own best bedroom.
</p>
<p>
After which Mary felt herself decidedly come down in the world; for that bed had been one of her important possessions distinguishing her from the common herd.
</p>
<p>
After a time a new and tender interest came into their lives. Although it increased their anxiety, for Dan could not look upon his precious little baby daughter, his pretty Eily, without new fears for his future.
</p>
<p>
When he came up from his land in the evenings he used to stand behind the hedge which separated his garden from the field beyond, to have a good look at the sweet mother and her pretty babe waiting for him on the wooden seat.
</p>
<p>
Many were the words of tender love which he murmured unseen to himself on these occasions, generally ending with, “May God keep throuble from her!”
</p>
<p>
But trouble came; wet seasons came, and the rent was raised again and again, until it became exorbitant. One cow died, and the other had to be sold, so had the high fields. Other children came, two little sons, who pined and died, soon after passing babyhood.
</p>
<p>
Wet seasons had swamped the fields by the river, and destroyed his crops, leaving no possible way of meeting the rent.
</p>
<p>
Mary had parted with everything of value that she possessed, for soon after Agent Jone’s arrival in the neighborhood a small branch pawn-office was set up in the village, where business was done in a private sort of way in the kitchen, where a large wooden box held all the articles to be forwarded to the shop in Ballenagera, and many a precious link between Mary and the happy past found its way into that box.

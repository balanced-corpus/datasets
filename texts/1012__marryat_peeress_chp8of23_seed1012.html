<p>But let it not be supposed in consequence that Susie at once forgets the teachings of her childhood. Far from it! Good seed cast upon a fertile ground (though it may lie fallow for awhile) cannot fail, sooner or later, to bring forth its fruit. And Susie is neither ungrateful nor naturally frivolous. But her childish eyes are dazzled, and her childish head whirls at the wonderful change wrought so suddenly in her uneventful life—a change which contrasts as powerfully with what has gone before it as a brilliant transformation scene with the gloom from which it is evoked. Even the inconvenience, fatigue, and trouble attendant on a nomadic existence, and which disgust most artists with a provincial career, are only so many new pleasures in Susie’s simple eyes.</p>

<p>To have to jump out of a train, almost before it has stopped at the station, and hurry off to the town to secure rooms before they are snapped up by the other members of the company, seems the most delightful fun in the world to the little Malisbury recluse. Rain or sunshine, cold or heat, make no difference to lighthearted Louie Montressor and Susie, as they rush off, helter skelter, to get what they require, leaving Miss de Vere grumbling in the waiting-room to keep watch over their luggage.</p>

<p>And how they do bargain for the rooms, and how Louie beats down the greedy landladies, and makes Susie laugh by punching the beds, and turning up her nose at the parlour, and depreciating everything, till she has secured the apartments at half the primary demand.</p>

<p>And then the delight of marketing on their own account, when she and Louie sally forth together, each with a basket on her arm, and bring home mutton chops and fish and vegetables for their early dinner. What adventures they encounter during the performance of these domestic duties, and how Louie chaffs the butchers and bakers until they get quite confused over the change, and sometimes find themselves out of pocket by the sallies of the cheeky little actress.</p>

<p>All this is sheer play to Susie, who grows more beautiful every day under the influence of congenial companionship and constant change of air. Even the equivocal stories she hears in the dressing-rooms do her no harm, for she does not understand them; and often laughs, simply because the others laugh, and not at all because she has caught the spirit of the joke. And her companions are the better for knowing her, although she never ventures to rebuke them for anything they may do or say.</p>

<p>Miss de Vere is more cautious of her speech in this girl’s presence than she has ever been known to be before; and Louie Montressor (who is not a bad-hearted young woman) offers of her own accord to accompany Susie to church on Sundays. For the child has not discontinued the practices which Miss Prescott taught her to regard as sacred duties. She still breathes her simple prayers, morning and evening, and attends divine service once a week, and reads her Bible quietly to herself before she gets into bed at night. It is not incompatible with a professional life to be a very good Christian, although the grossly ignnorant are so apt to declare it is.</p>

<p>But with all Susie’s content, there is a want in her new life which she feels without being able to explain. She has all the pleasure and excitement she could possibly desire. Her father pays her a regular salary once a week with the rest of the company, of which she is inordinately proud, and he never meets her without a look of admiration and a word of encouragement —perhaps a caress. And yet the girl misses something, though she scarcely acknowledges as much to herself. It is Miss Prescott’s daily affection and sympathy, the feeling that she was <em>first</em> with some one, and that the old lady thought more of her than she did of herself.</p>

<p>Joseph Gresham is proud of his daughter—more, he is fond of her—and had he the opportunity, would probably develop into a most tender and devoted father. But he has not the opportunity, would probably develop into a most tender and devoted father. But he has not the opportunity. He is a man immersed in business, often obliged to leave his company as soon as ever it is settled in one place, and travel on to the next to make arrangements for its reception there. He sees Susie every day, but he cannot possibly spare the time to become really acquainted with her, and, therefore, confidence is not established between them. He receives excellent accounts of her progress in singing and dancing from the musical director and the ballet master, and he can see that she evinces distinct ability on the stage, and promises to do much more than her mother did before her. All this makes him proud, and he slips many a sovereign into the child’s hand  on treasury mornings, and tells her, with a kiss, that she will be a credit to him, and she is to buy herself a new hat as a reward for working so hard.</p>

<p>Susie values her father’s praise and gifts above all other things, but they do not bring her any nearer to him as a friend and <em>confidante,</em> and she remains as shy in his presence as she was the first day of their meeting—perhaps rather more so. This is a great  disadvantage to the girl, for hers is an open heart, used to disburthen itself of all its troubles and perplexities, and failing her father, she is naturally thrown back upon her younger companions for sympathy. Of these two, Louie Montressor is her favourite. The two girls are seldom separate. They sleep together, and walk and talk together, and become the natural recipients of each others’  secrets, of which (as may be supposed) Miss Montressor has far the larger number to communicate. Gresham sees his daughter’s blooming face, and notes her happy demeanour, and naturally believes that all is right with her. Sometimes he asks her privately if she is quite comfortable, and has everything she may require, and the alacrity with which she answers in the affirmative sets his mind completely at rest as to the necessity of making any change in his own habits on her account. So he continues to live at the hotels, and hang about the bars and smoking-rooms with his associates, and to let Susie do pretty much as her own inclinations and Louie Montressor’s advice may persuade her.</p>

<p>This young lady’s weakness—like that of many of her sex—is for admiration, and she does not much care from whom it may proceed, so long as it is hers. She is a very pretty girl, with a vivacious, gipsy-like beauty that takes most men by storm (especially on the stage), and the name of her adorers—known and unknown— is Legion. Never had any girl such a number of anonymous bouquets, bracelets, and letters before, and the other female members of the company are proportionately jealous and spiteful. Susie’s innocent mind is unable at first to comprehend what can be the use or meaning of presents that are sent without a name attached to them.</p>

<p>“They cannot even know that you’ve received them,” she says.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, they do!” replies Louie. “I bet no man ever sent me a flower but what he knew I’d got it, as soon as I walked on the stage. There’s a way about me they understand. Why, do you know, there’s a young fellow in Manchester, who sits in the front row of the pit every night I play there, and he’s done it for years. I know him as well as I do my own father, only I’ve never spoken to him. He generally sends me chocolate creams. He has found out somehow that I love chocolate creams above everything in the world.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he always sits in that place whoever is playing,” suggests Susie innocently.</p>

<p>“Don’t you tell Louie that,” says Miss de Vere, “or she’ll poison you. She fancies every man in the theatre has come expressly to look at her, and as it amuses her and doesn’t hurt <em>us,</em> it is just as well to let the harmless delusion continue.”</p>

<p>Rubbish!” cries Louie; “you only say that because you’re jealous, and you know that since it’s come out that you’re married, you haven’t had half the bouquets you had before.”</p>

<p>Miss de Vere shrugs her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I prefer my husband to the bouquets.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you do, and perhaps you don’t,” retorts Louie—”anyway, you evidently don’t get both.”</p>

<p>“For which I have chiefly to thank you for blabbing the truth wherever you can.”</p>

<p>“The truth should always be spoken, my dear,” replies Miss Louie, with mock solemnity; “besides, what on earth has a married lady to do with bangles and bon-bons? I am sure Mr. Thompson would not approve of your keeping them if they were sent to you.”</p>

<p>The only reply Miss de Vere makes to this remark, is by getting up and leaving the room. Louie Montressor’s unquestionable superiority to herself, as an actress and dancer, is a sore subject with her. She still holds first rank as a singer, but she knows that the sparkling manner of her rival on the stage does more damage in front than her best vocalisation.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Thompson has actually retired to her room. What a blessing,” cries Louie fervently. “Now we shall have the afternoon to ourselves, and I will tell you of the rarest bit of fun we had at Scarborough you ever heard of.”</p>

<p>She is very careful not to initiate Susie into all the secrets of the prison-house at once. She takes her (as she herself would express it) “very gently over the stones,” and tones down the rough edges of her mad escapades, until they appear like mere girlish frolics. And through all there is no real vice about Louie Montressor. She is a girl of the people, who has climbed to her present position by dint of hard work, and she does not possess refined notions on any subject. Added to which, she very thoughtless and wild, and enjoys going to the brink of the precipice. But she is perfectly well able to look after herself, and will never be pushed over the brink. It is for this reason that no inkling of her conduct has ever reached her manager’s ears, because (however great the risk she may run) Louie always manages to come off scot-free. She does the most daring things of any member of the company, and yet she has never been caught in a real scrape in her life. She is, in fact, a clever, daring girl, with plenty of pluck to pursue her own pleasure, and plenty of tact to escape the consequences of the pursuit. She perhaps as dangerous a companion as Susie could have, because she commands her admiration, whilst she piques her curiosity, and so gains an undue influence over her.</p>

<p>There is only one person of whom Louie stands in awe, and that is Miss de Vere. She knows that the fair Geraldine would seize an opportunity of traducing her to the manager, in hopes of procuring her dismissal from the company. Indeed, Louie shrewdly suspects that the only reason Miss de Vere continues to live with her is that she may catch her in some delinquency that shall work her ruin. For Joseph Gresham is as particular now as he was in the days of Bessie Bouverie, that his company shall bear a good name for its private as well as its public character. When, therefore, it is announced that (in acknowledgment of the services she had rendered him) he has granted Miss de Vere a fortnight’s holiday, during which time her part in the burlesque will be taken by her understudy, Miss Amy Lovell, Louie Montressor falls into such a fever of delight that she seizes Susie by both hands, and dances round and round with her.</p>

<p>“Fancy, my dear!” she exclaims, “the delight of getting rid of <em>Mrs. Thompson</em> for a whole week! Blessed for ever be Mr. T. for having
sent for her! If he wished to consummate my happiness, he would get her a London engagement! But that would be too much bliss for this mortal life. Won’t we have fun, though, whilst she is away? We shall be at York, you know, where there are heaps of officers; and Amy Lovell can’t sing a bit. She’s a regular duffer, so I shall have it all my own way. Oh,let us be
joyful!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” cries Susie, quite ready to catch her friend’s enthusiasm,  “and we’ll eat as many tarts as we like, Louie, without having lectures about our teeth, and be able to take a walk, after the theatre, if the nights are fine, and to go to bed in the afternoon,  and do anything we like. Oh, it <em>will</em> be nice, dear, you and I together, without granny to scold us for everything; won t it?”</p>

<p><em>“Rather,”</em> replies Louie; “but you must hang by me, Susie, you know, and not blab all we may do, in the dressing-room; for I mean to have a real week of it, I can tell you; and the governor might cut up rough, if it came to his ears. It’s going to be honour bright between us, isn t it?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” says Susie, rather wounded by the doubt. “You  don’t think, do you, that I’d be so mean as to go and tell anything you wished kept secret?”</p>

<p>For, in her heart, she has no suspicion that if Louie’s worst pranks were subjected to the light of public opinion, they would incur more than the usual blame accorded to a school-girl’s folly. So, on the Saturday before the company moves on to York, Geraldine de Vere goes up to London by the night mail, and her two companions inaugurate their freedom on Sunday by a dinner of tarts, washed down with ginger beer. At York (as Louie prognosticated), the theatre is filled with officers, and the little acctress’s triumphs begin.</p>

<p>There is a class of men, unfortunately but too common in the British army, whose minds are imbued by two ideas. The first is, that no woman on the stage can possibly be virtuous; the second, that (even were she so) would be absurd to suppose she could resist <em>their</em> advances. Why men in the army should conclude they are more irresistible in the eyes of the other sex than men in the civil service, the navy, the church, or the law, it is hard to determine; but they have laid down the rule for themselves, and it would be difficult to disabuse them of it. These are the men (I will not call them gentlemen) who disgrace the profession to which they belong, by sending their insulting anonymous love-letters to any actress whose face and figure may have taken their fancy. They do not even wait to procure an introduction to her; they do not ask if she is married or single, light-minded or sober. It is sufficient for these officers and gentlemen that they admire her personally, and they throw out the bait haphazard.</p>

<p>There is not an attractive actress, who has made the tour of the provinces, who has not stories to tell of the sorry compliments she has received from the officers of regiments quartered in country towns.</p>

<p>Of course there are women quite as bad as these men suppose them to be; and there are others, sharp enough to take all the advantages the acquaintanceship may offer them, without compromising themselves in return. But there are many virtuous gentlewomen on the stage—and the wider the truth is known the better—who are bitterly insulted and outraged by the invitations they receive, and the presents they are asked to accept; and these women go about from place to place, loudly expressing their indignation at the dishonour shown them, and designating the officers of the regiment from which it emanated as a set of “cads.”</p>

<p>If some of these gentlemen, who consider a sword-belt and a sash such irresistible appendages, could only hear the terms in which they are spoken of by the people they profess to patronise, they would look very small, and probably sing very small for the future.</p>

<p>It was not many months ago that a pretty young actress (who evidently knew little of the army beyond what had been most unpleasantly brought under her immediate notice) remarked quite seriously that she supposed the reason the officers quartered in country towns did not know how to behave themselves, was because they sent all the tradesmen’s sons into the country. But the way in which the men she alluded to had behaved to her (a young married woman), would have disgraced any honest tradesmen.</p>

<p>The regiment stationed in York on the present occasion of Gresham’s comedy and burlesque company visiting the theatre, is not perhaps entitled to such hard censure as some, but its members are sufficiently frivolous, nevertheless, and, unfortunately, Louie Montressor is quite ready to meet their advances half way. She has taken part in so many escapades before, and come safely out of them, that she does not believe in the possibility of any serious misfortune happening to her. Did she not go driving with that handsome Captain Russell at Scarborough? and at six o’clock in the evening, when they were five miles out in the country, didn’t he throw the horse down and break its knees, and they thought they never should get back that night? But a baker’s cart came along at the last moment, and she jumped in it, and gave the man half-a-crown to drive fast, and was put down at the stage door, just ten minutes before she had to go on. Oh, she awfully lucky!—so she tells Susie—there’s a good genius hanging about her, who never allows her to be caught out at anything. Never mind how hair-breadth the escape, she always comes off victorious. Why, once at Southampton she went on the water with such a dear duck of a fellow, whose name she has quite forgotten (but she knows he had black eyes and hair, and was something in the dockyard), and neither of them had a watch, so they mistook the time, and when they landed, she found it was five minutes past the time for raising the curtain.</p>

<p>“La, my child!” cries Miss Louie, in fits of laughter at the remembrance, “how I did run. I didn’t even wait to say thank you to the fellow; and I believe he was offended, for I’ve never seen him from that day to this. And when I reached the theatre, what do you think? Something had gone wrong with the gas, and they couldn’t take up the ‘rag’ till half-an-hour later than the usual time. <em>There</em> was luck for you! But it’s always the way with me. My good genius has never let me come to grief, and never will.</p>

<p>“Your mother-wit, you mean, Louie,” says Susie, laughing.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, whatever it is, you may trust to it. Keep alongside of me, and you’ll be safe. And there’s a lot of fun to be got out of life, Susie, if you only know how to set about it. We can’t all be ‘grannies,’  like de Vere, can we? And we’ll have a lark together, you and I—see if we don’t—before we leave this blessed old city behind us.”</p>

<p>In confirmation of which promise, as they return from the theatre a few nights later, and sit down to their frugal supper, Miss Montressor (prefacing the act by many a mysterious wink and smile) draws a letter from the pocket of her ulster, and holds it up to Susie triumphantly.</p>

<p>“It’s come, my dear!” she cries; “it’s come. I couldn’t even whisper the good news to you, with that officious creature, Amy Lovell, walking home with us to-night—but I <em>told</em> you it would come—and it <em>has.”</em></p>

<p><em>“What</em> has come?” inquires Susie, arrested in her fierce attack upon the bread and butter.</p>

<p>“Why! an invitation for you and me to supper. You saw the stage box full of officers to-night? They sent round this letter just as we were coming away! Didn’t I say you and I would have a lark together, before we left this old hole behind us—eh—Susie?”</p>

<p>“But <em>who</em> has asked us?” says Susie, with opened eyes. “We know no one here. We can’t go and take supper with strangers.”</p>

<p>Miss Montressor sees she has been on the brink of a precipice. An indiscreet admission, and she would have roused Susie’s modesty, and lost all chance of securing her as a companion in her intended escapade. The fact is, the invitation she has received is from a man, whose name even she has never heard before—one of the officers from the barracks, who has occupied the stage box that night, and thinks perhaps (as she does) that it will be a great “lark” to get the pretty little actress out to supper with himself and some of his friends. No mention whatever is made of Susie in the note, but the writer begs Miss Montressor will bring any friend with her whom she may choose, and Louie chooses that it shall be Susie. She has a twofold reason for wishing the manager’s daughter to accompany her. In the first place, she thinks it will be the securest method of closing Susie’s lips upon the subject; and, in the second, that should their little solecism be discovered, Gresham will not be so likely to make an open scandal of it, if his own child’s name suffers for his want of forbearance. But, in order to accomplish her object, Louie sees that she must dissemble a little with regard to the main facts of the case. So she professes to receive Susie’s last assertion with the utmost
amusement.</p>

<p><em>“Not know any one here!”</em> she echoes. “Speak for yourself, my dear! <em>You</em> may not have acquaintances in York; but you forget <em>I</em> have played here about twenty times before.”</p>

<p>“Are they friends of yours, then, Louie?”</p>

<p><em>“Of course</em> they are. Do you suppose I should accept an invitation from people who were <em>not</em> friends? The gentleman who has asked us is a sort of cousin of mine. He would think it awfully unkind if we didn’t go.”</p>

<p>Oh, fancy!  exclaims Susie childishly; “and what is his name?”</p>

<p>Louie has to refer to her letter, in order to learn her cousin’s name.</p>

<p>“Fairfax! Frederick Fairfax! Doesn’t it sound romantic; and poor Fred was always such a favourite of mine too. I should break my heart if I couldn’t see him for an hour before we leave York; and you will go with me, dear, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I should like to— <em>very</em> much,” replies Susie fervently; “but I wonder your cousin hasn’t been to see you before, Louie.”</p>

<p>“He cannot get away from barracks, my dear. They’re awfully strict in the army, you know, and keep the poor fellows locked up half the day ; but Fred wants us to go to supper to-morrow evening; and you will come, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Will anybody else be there?” asks Susie fearfully.</p>

<p>“Just a lady or two to meet us, perhaps, and some of Fred’s friends. It’s sure to be a very quiet affair though, because he asks us to go straight to his rooms from the theatre.”</p>

<p>“In our old dresses, Louie?”</p>

<p>“Well, we can go to the theatre in any dress we like, you know. I, for my part, shall brighten myself up a little, but we must not do anything to rouse the suspicions of the other girls, because they’re all so spiteful, they’ll make a story out of it at once. You have a white muslin frock, haven’t you, and that will do as well as anything.”</p>

<p>“Louie,” says Susie presently, “will father be angry with me, do you think?”</p>

<p>“He won’t let you go if you tell him of it; that’s poz.”</p>

<p>“But then I oughtn’t to go, surely.”</p>

<p>My dear child, you’re a baby, and don’t understand these things. Your father’s the ‘boss’ of this company, and obliged to be very strict with them. He isn’t a bit strict in reality (as you know), but if he didn’t hold the reins tight, they’d be all over the shop. If he gave you leave to go to this quiet little supper, Amy Lovell would probably call him unjust if he objected to her attending a masked ball. He must pretend to have the same rules for his daughter as for everybody else, but if you don’t mention it, neither will he. Why, you don’t suppose, do you, that he would have placed you to live with me if he had thought should teach you anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“No,” replies Susie dubiously; “and if Mr. Fairfax is a cousin of yours.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, my dear; it’s a little bit of harmless fun with my cousin and his friends— just a slice of chicken and ham and a glass of champagne. What’s the wickedness of that? Are we to be kept like nuns in a nunnery all our lives? It’s absurd to think of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” replies her companion; “but if my father should <em>ask</em> me about it, Louie, you knowI  can’t tell him a lie.”</p>

<p>“He won’t ask you, my dear! Never fear!” laughs Miss Montressor; “why should he ask about what he knows nothing? And you wouldn’t get <em>me</em> into a scrape unnecessarily, would you, Susie?” she adds coaxingly,  “because (though I’d be the last person under ordinary circumstances to remind you of it, dear), you know I’ve been very kind to you, and taken lot of trouble about you since you joined the company; haven’t I,
now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you have indeed,” cries Susie gratefully.</p>

<p>“I’ve stood your friend on every occasion in the dressing-room, and never let one of the girls run you down or say that you wouldn’t be on the stage at all if you weren’t the boss’s daughter; and it’ll be very hard lines if you betray me now, Susie.”</p>

<p>“I’ll <em>never</em> betray you, dear!” exclaims Susie fervently.</p>

<p>“I’m sure you won’t. You’re too much of a brick to turn against a true friend. Well then, I’ll tell you what we’ll do, dear, just slip on  a pretty frock, and a big cloak over it, to-morrow evening, and as soon as the show’s over, we’ll dress as quickly as we can, so as to get out before the others, and Fairfax says he’ll be waiting with a carriage for us opposite the post-office. I’ll send him a line to-night to say we will be there, and we’ll have the rarest fun in the world before we get back again.”</p>

<p>So Susie is drawn into the plot, almost against her will, because her conscience will not satisfy her she is acting right—-and yet—child-like—she cannot help a feeling of excitement and expectation rising in her breast when she thinks of the coming pleasure. A supper, after the theatre, with officers and ladies. It is a new experience to Susie. She has never attended what she calls a “grown-up” party before, and she cannot help being elated at the idea.</p>

<p>Yet she wishes she might tell her father. She wishes she had sufficient boldness to confide the scheme to him, and ask his permission to carry it out. But Joseph Gresham has done so little towards gaining his daughter’s confidence, that Louie Montressor seems the greater friend of the two to her; and she would rather run the risk of <em>his</em> anger, than of <em>hers.</em> Gresham observes that Susie looks more than usually shy and timid as he meets her at the wings the following evening, and that her answers to his inquiries are delivered in a low voice, and with a somewhat constrained manner. He has no time to notice it at the moment, when the exigencies of stage management are calling him in another direction, but he does not forget it as he goes about his usual business, and detects himself wondering more than once if the child can be ill, or have experienced any annoyance.</p>

<p>The idea gains upon him as the evening proceeds, and he watches her face furtively from the wings, or the front of the house, and the first thing he does when work is fairly over, is to go to the general dressing-room, and ask for his daughter. A chorus of shrill voices from within inform him that she has already gone home. This unusual haste on Susie’s part seems to confirm Gresham’s opinion that she is not well, and he is about to hurry after her to make inquiries, when some one seizes him by the arm, and drags him in another direction.</p>

<p>Everything must succumb to business in professional life, and Gresham  finds sufficient matter in his colloquy with his new acquaintance to detain him for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>The stranger has some commercial scheme to unfold, and Gresham takes him to his hotel, and they hang about the bar talking and drinking together, till the night has far advanced. But when at last they separate, Gresham cannot make up his mind to go to bed, until he has asked after Susie. His heart is far more wrapt up in his
beautiful child than he acknowledges to himself, and the idea that she may be suffering, makes him restless and uneasy. So, knowing that professionals soon get into the habit of keeping late hours, he puts on his hat and strolls towards Miss Montressor’s lodgings, in case the girls should still be up. If all should be dark and quiet, he argues, it will be a natural sequence to suppose them safe in bed, and, therefore, nothing serious the matter. All is not dark and quiet, however, for the hall door is open, the gas is burning in the passage, and the landlady (very cross and put out by such unusual proceedings), is standing on her doorstep, with her apron to her face, looking up and down the road. As Gresham comes suddenly upon her, she starts.</p>

<p>“Lor’, sir! is it you? I was in hopes it was the young ladies, for I’m fairly tired out sitting up for them.”</p>

<p>“The young ladies!” exclaims Gresham; “why, where have they gone?”</p>

<p>I’m sure I don’t know, sir; out to supper with friends, I believe. I thought, likely enough, you’d be with ‘em. But it’s too bad of them, it is, keeping me up in this way, when they know as I haven’t slept a wink with the face-ache for a week past.”</p>

<p>“When did they go? With what friends?” demands Gresham hurriedly.</p>

<p>He thinks he has gained clue to his daughter’s strange manner that evening, and the idea enrages him. He does not dream of blaming Susie; he knows her innocence of the world and its wicked ways too well, but he is angry with himself for having trusted her to so wild a girl as Montressor, and determines at once to follow them, and put a stop to any possible mischief.</p>

<p>With whom did they go? You must know,” he continues, earnestly, to the landlady.</p>

<p>“Lor’, sir! I don’t! How should I? ‘Tain’t my business to question my lodgers as to their doings. Miss Montressor, she said, this afternoon, as she and Miss Gresham were going to have their supper with some friends, and I’d better let them have the latchkey. But I haven’t got such a thing, so I’m bound to sit up for ‘em; but they promised me not to be gone more than an hour and an ‘alf. And now it’s more than two.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t you see their friends—haven’t they called here?” asks Gresham.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, one of the hofficer gentlemen from the barracks called this evening, after the ladies had gone to the theatre, and asked for ‘em by name, and I told him as they was gone, and he said he didn’t think they’d leave so early. And then he says, ‘Hif they come ‘ome,’ he says,  ‘after the theatre, tell ‘em,’ he says, ‘as I shall be hoppersite the post office with a carriage by ‘alf-past ten,’ he says. “So I supposed as ‘e was one of the gentlemen they was a-going to sup with.”</p>

<p>An oath escapes from Gresham’s lips.</p>

<p>“Do you know the gentleman’s name?” he says.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, sir! It was Captain Fairfax. He had a friend lodged with me once, and he was here then almost every day—I knows ‘im well!”</p>

<p>“And where does this Fairfax live?”</p>

<p>“Not very far, sir—about half-a-mile away. He lives in Bessborough Terrace—most of the hofficers do—it’s close to the barracks, and I think his number’s eleven, but I’m not quite sure. If it ain’t eleven it’s nine, but—”</p>

<p>“That will do; <em>I’ll</em> find him!” exclaims Gresham, with another oath, as he strides furiously away.</p>

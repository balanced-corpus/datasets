<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<hr> <!-- Space in between title and body text in original text. -->

<p>If Adela was an ” awful nuisance ” to George at Bluehaven, George was an agonising discomfort to poor Adela. Torquemada’s sudden mystery four years ago had never been clearly understood by Adela, but had been felt by her with all the perplexity of unconscious guilt. Miss Smith, without clearly telling her anything, had made her feel as if she had committed a crime.</p>

<p>It was from ” mamma ” she had discovered the horrid puzzle was connected with George. She never would have guessed it if left to her own slow imagination. Mamma had spoken to her, and what mamma had said sounded awful to the young girl’s fluttering mind, partly from Clara’s severely alarming manner, and partly because Adela, though only grasping a dim sort of instinct rather than meaning from her words, had yet been filled by them with a strange shyness and a curious kind of vague shame. She was barely thirteen at the time of the grand mystery, and had the unimpressionable, slowly developing nature you often see in a very blonde, stolidly placid girl. Nellie was quite different : at thirteen she would have seized the idea Adela could not rightly grasp.</p>

<p>To do her justice, Clara had felt a little ashamed of putting notions into Adela’s innocent young head ; and so, when she had said to the child, ” George has been paying you marked attention, and, Adela, you have dared to encourage him. I am very angry; I can never allow this thing,” she had also made her little daughter promise never to mention these words or to speak of George to any one. And Adela had kept the promise through fear of her mother, and also because of the bewildering, awkward shame she felt in even mentioning George’s name. She would blush if others mentioned it ; and it was really this discomfort about George which had kept her from telling Nellie, as a dead secret, the curious thing mamma had said.</p>

<p>However, when one whole year passed and George did not come to Eastcourt, and a second long year went by slowly, as years do when we are young, and Adela did not meet him, and then a third year passed, Clara saw the girl was forgetting her awkwardness, and noticed she had even ceased to blush at the mention of George’s name. At first the judicious mother made no remark, for she happened just then to be thinking of inviting Rupert Torrings to her house, and was trying to get hold of the Honble. Fred. But when she found Rupert Torrings only liked black-haired girls, and that Lady Harchester was a fortified stronghold protecting the Honble. Fred, while Sir Cuthbert Crofton’s disease was so rapidly creating expectations for George that Dr Fozzle had to order the Bishop to that bracing place, Bluehaven, Clara considered the moment had come when it would be wise to make Adela feel awkward again.</p>

<p>So, before leaving Eastcourt, she had warned Adela to beware of George Crofton’s attentions. This had revived the old discomfort, and thrown the poor girl into such a perplexity of shyness, that she had implored her mother with tears to let her stay at home.</p>

<p>” No, Adela,; you <em>must</em> go to Bluehaven,” Clara had said, in that voice of hers no child ever disobeyed. And Adela was still a child in nature and character, if not quite in years. ” No, Adela ; if you stayed away, George would think you had purposely avoided him. And when a young lady—you are grown up, quite grown up, Adela—when a young lady of your age avoids a young gentleman, he thinks...do you know what he thinks ? ... he thinks...she is in love with him ! “</p>

<p>” Oh, mamma, how dreadful ! ” cried the young girl, in an agony of shame.</p>

<p>” You do well to blush, Adela ; that is what George would think if you remained at Eastcourt. So I insist upon your coming to Bluehaven, and behaving perfectly naturally to him. Do you hear ? Perfectly naturally. I shall watch you, Adela, and see you neither avoid nor encourage him. You must be natural, but you must also be distant in your manner to him now, because you are grown up. He is grown up too.” And Clara had again repeated, ” Remember, Adela, I shall watch you ! “</p>

<p>Stolidly unimaginative and placid as Adela was, the terrible feeling of being watched by ” mamma ” was nervous torture to her.</p>

<p>When she arrived at Bluehaven, she would have given all she possessed to have met George when mamma was not by ; but mamma was by. The girl was always feeling Clara’s presence now. She felt it intensely on meeting George for the first time, and she shook hands with her old playmate in a state of such painful, blushing trepidation, that he very naturally exclaimed, ” I say, Adela, what’s the matter ? you look awfully queer.” At this the unfortunate girl turned white, and thought she would faint ; and the kind Admiral thought so too, and placed her on the sofa, brought her water, and made quite a fuss about her. From pallor she blushed into the deepest red.</p>

<p>” Adela is a little overtired. We had a very hot and dusty journey,” said Clara calmly ; but Adela only blushed the more, and George was suddenly made uncomfortable by feeling Mrs Newsham’s near glance searching him.</p>

<p>Adela turned white again. She was thinking, ” What will mamma say afterwards ? ” She was curiously afraid of that white angel her mother, and she trembled all over.</p>

<p>” Why, Mrs Newsham, the poor child has got the ague ! ” cried out the Admiral, who believed in the ague, and believed in no other disease, for it was his own particular malady. ” That’s exactly the way an attack comes on. When I was off Vera Cruz, I was seized with the shakes all of a sudden. Just like this—shook from head to foot : never was more surprised in my life. Such piping hot weather, and there was I shivering ! But I was cured in no time by some quinine pills I have kept about me ever since. I have some boxes of them now up at the Lookout.” The Admiral called his cottage ” The Lookout.” ” Nothing like taking one of those pills in time,” he said to Adela, ” so I will go up to the Lookout and send you one down by Charlie ; take it immediately, my dear, and you will be quite well soon.”</p>

<p>This is what Clara said to poor Adela afterwards : ” Adela, did not I expressly tell you to be perfectly natural with George ? ” Adela began to cry.</p>

<p>” Stop crying this moment, Adela, and answer me. Did I not tell you to be natural with George ? ” But Adela really could not speak for sobbing. ” How dare you disobey me, Adela ?  I told you to be perfectly natural with George, instead of which you were most remarkable, most extraordinary in your behaviour. You made a regular scene. I am shocked at you, Adela !—shocked !  You have no dignity, no proper girlish sensitiveness of modesty, or you would have been ashamed to attract George’s attention, and make him ask what was the matter with you. Your manner betrayed what a young lady should never, never betray!  And I could see from George’s look what idea it was crossed his mind.”</p>

<p>At these words poor Adela felt as if she could die of shame. Clara saw she had made the right impression, so continued— ” By letting George feel his presence has the power to unnerve you, you are provoking— yes, Adela, you are provoking attention on his part. You are asking him to pay you marked attention. Now listen to me “— Clara spoke in her most repressive tone of voice—” now listen to me. I am determined, firmly determined, you shall not encourage him, Adela. You must never play more than two games of lawn-tennis with him. You must refuse if he asks you to play a third, but without giving any reason. And if you go out boating with the Admiral, and George is there, you must not be taking George’s hand and letting him help you in and out of the Dancer. You can climb up from the punt or walk along the gangboard by yourself. It is quite different for Eleanour; she may do as she likes, for she is not yet grown up, but you are old enough to be married. Now remember, Adela,” were Clara’s last words—” remember I shall know if you obey me or not, for I will keep my eye upon you ; and though I shall not go out boating, as it makes me sea-sick, I will watch you through the spy-glass from the Admiral’s semaphore.”</p>

<p>If Adela had not been naturally phlegmatic, she would certainly have got a nervous fever. Notwithstanding the quinine pills, she looked really ill ; so the Admiral insisted on her taking them for ten days. He himself had taken them for three weeks that memorable time off Vera Cruz. But this kindly meant doctoring only made Adela worse, for the Admiral was always inquiring after her symptoms.</p>

<p>” Had she a recurrence of that trembling ? Was she still constantly turning white and red, and feeling hot and cold ? ” And one day the Admiral asked these questions out boating, and George was sitting face to face with her.</p>

<p>Adela answered with such blushing cheeks and such a curious confusion of manner that both George and Charlie exclaimed, in one breath, through sheer astonishment, ” I say, Adela, what a fool you are ! “</p>

<p>Even Nellie, who hardly ever made a disagreeable remark, said, “Adela, you are queer! so queer ever since you came to Bluehaven! 
And it is all because mamma tells you you are grown up. I know it is ! When I am grown up,” she added, with a decision that was quite unusual to her,—” when I am grown up, I will be just what I am now. I won’t change a bit. No, I won’t.”</p>

<p>” Nellie, you are a brick ! ” exclaimed Charlie, warmly. ” I am sure you will never be a fool.”</p>

<p>And though civil speeches were not in George’s ” line,” he actually said, ” You always had some sense, Nellie. Even that ridiculous Miss Smith could not make an ass of you.” As he spoke he looked with the utmost contempt at poor Adela.</p>

<p>There was something in his look which made Clara’s agitating words, ” George will think you are in love with him,” rush upon her mind, and the young girl then and there burst into tears.</p>

<p>” Oh, poor Adela ! poor Adela ! I am afraid she is sea-sick,” cried Nellie, sympathetically.</p>

<p>” R.O.T ! ” mumbled George, audibly.</p>

<p>” Land her this instant, father,” said Charlie, firmly—he was a young fellow of strong character.</p>

<p>But tears—a woman’s tears—were infinitely distressing to the kind Admiral’s tender soul. He had not reproved the boys for that first exclamation of theirs, because, although he himself had not the heart to chide Adela, he could not help thinking it was no harm others should make her feel she was getting funnily self-conscious in her ways. ” It must be affectation,” he had thought, ” for the child was quite natural at Eastcourt.” Yet when tears were streaming down Adela’s blushing cheeks, and were reddening her eyes and distorting her pretty face, the Admiral suddenly waxed indignant, and gave the boys a fine scolding ;
he was particularly severe upon George, because he had seen the contemptuous look of dislike the lad had given Adela.</p>

<p>George thought he was being unjustly ” blown up,” and got sulky and disagreeable, and wanted, rightly or wrongly, to go out beyond the bar sea-fishing in the rough water, and he muttered loud enough for the Admiral to hear, ” Serve the girls right if they are sea-sick. Girls are a horrid bore in a boat.”</p>

    <p>The Admiral was incensed at such ungallantry. ” Come, come, sir ! no more of this, sir ! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, sir.” When the Admiral said ” sir,” it was a sign he was really angry. ” In my day a young man of eighteen—d——n sir, just nineteen—a man of nineteen was a gentleman, and had the manners of a gentleman towards ladies. We should have kicked him out of the service if he had behaved like a booby schoolboy.”</p>

<p>From the instant the Dancer’s head would be turned towards land, Adela’s whole mind would be taken up thinking how she could best jump into the punt and ashore without a helping hand. So far she had contrived to do this successfully and without attracting attention.</p>

<p>But to-day the Admiral was on the alert. He was a man who always did what he considered his duty; and on this occasion he thought it his bounden duty to see the ” youngsters ” had good manners.</p>

<p>The Dancer wanted some little thing doing to her that required her to be run up for an hour or two on the sandy beach, instead of being left as usual at her moorings off the pier.</p>

<p>Charles Crofton handed Nellie down from the yacht like a perfect Lord Chesterfield.</p>

<p>” Now, sir,” said the Admiral, turning to George—” now, sir, give your hand to Adela. Behave like a gentleman, sir. Help her out carefully, sir. Adela, give your hand to George.”</p>

<p>The startled Adela was obeying mechanically, for
the Admiral spoke sharply, and he was generally so mild, when, with her hand almost touching George’s, and her foot on the gunwale, she suddenly remembered that terrible spy-glass. She turned, drew back, looked up at the cliff above, caught sight of the semaphore, and in the flutter of the moment lost her footing, and slipped down between the yacht and gangboard. Fortunately the tide was not full in, and the Admiral had run the Dancer well up on the beach, so she was only wet to the waist. But if she had been drowned by George, the Admiral could hardly have been more indignant. He reprimanded his nephew as he would have done a midshipman who was a disgrace to her Majesty’s navy. George made matters worse by angrily repeating that Adela was an awful duffer, and had fallen into the water because she was a fool. This was more than the Admiral could stand ; he actually raised his right hand, in which he flourished a rope-end, exclaiming, ” How dare you, sir ? How dare you, sir ? “</p>

<p>At this Adela, all dripping, rushed forward and caught his arm, and cried out, ” George is right. It was my fault, not his. I would not take his hand. I would not ...on purpose.”</p>

<p>” On purpose ! ” stammered the astounded Admiral.</p>

<p>” Because,” cried Adela—” because ...” Good heavens ! she had almost said, ” Because of mamma ; she is looking through the spy-glass.” But she stopped short, glanced up nervously at the semaphore, seemed to feel that awful near presence of Clara, just as if her mother could hear as well as see her, and, blushing scarlet, and with infinite embarrassment, said instead, ” Because I—I—I am now grown up ! “</p>

<p>The Admiral reeled round in the intensity of his astonished amusement at Adela’s words and ridiculous self-conscious look, like a shy highly proper white rat dripping in the water; and he laughed, and laughed as only an old tar or a young boy can. Charlie with Eleanour came running back to know what the Admiral was laughing at. Adela looked at him so piteously that he did not tell them then ; but he laughed more and more, and George, forgetting his ill-humour, began to laugh to.</p>

<p>When George laughed—”He is laughing because he thinks I am in love with him ! “—the draggled Adela wished she had really been drowned, so overpowered with shame and vexation did she feel, and she sprang from the waterside up the beach, and took to her heels and ran towards home as quickly as she could.</p>

<p>” I say, Adela has had a ducking,” cried Charlie cheerily, almost as if he were pleased.</p>

<p>” And Adela hates even wetting her feet. And, oh dear ! oh dear ! she has got her light-grey dress on ! What will mamma say ? ” exclaimed Nellie. ” I think I had better run after her, Charlie,” she whispered ; ” she will be so dreadfully afraid of mamma.”</p>

<p>” You are horrid cowards ! you all are ! ” said Charlie, scornfully ; but he ran after Nellie, who was already off.</p>

<p>The Admiral found himself standing alone with George. He took his hand and shook it warmly. ” My good fellow, I was hard on you. I am sorry I gave it to you so hotly, George, for the child is a precious little fool. Ha ! ha ! ha ! Such notions for a baby’s head ! “</p>

<p>Adela was so slim and tiny— she was shorter than Nellie— and had such a very youthful pink and white face, that the Admiral thought her much younger than she was, and never in the slightest degree realised she was just seventeen. She certainly had the look and manner, and to a great extent the mind, of fourteen.</p>

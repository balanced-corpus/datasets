<!-- chapter entitled "The Rival" -->
<p>
Meanwhile the time that passed so pleasantly for Jack had been to his rival a period of jealous torture. 
The sight of that hat bearing the regimental colours, the thought that the old man had played with and 
deceived him, and that Brett was in the house all the time wrought his fierce nature to a very frenzy 
of jealous spite.
</p>
<p>
Arrived at barracks he went through the whole range of quarters to make sure of his surmise by seeing 
if his rival were anywhere about, and found the Major and Jack only unaccounted for.
</p>
<p>
He retired to his room with gleaming eyes and rising passion; the Major was out of the question—and for 
the other!—A red mist seemed to float before his eyes, and such a sudden fury of rage and hatred flamed 
up within him as for the moment frightened even himself.
</p>
<p>
If Jemima had promised herself, her love, her fortune to the man he loathed and detested, that promise 
should never, never be kept! Sooner would he take the sin of murder on his soul.—Kill her or her lover 
or both—than stand by and let that marriage take place.
</p>
<p>
When his frenzy had a little calmed down, he took up his post on the verandah, with some vague idea of 
seeing his foe arrive, and judging what fortune he had met with from his face.
</p>
<p>
“The young fool’s features tell all” he cried contemptuously, “If she has said ‘yes’ he will come in like 
a very bridegroom, if ‘no’ the fact will be patent in his hang-dog looks.”
</p>
<p>
All in barracks but he were stridently jubilant over the thoughts of active service and the youthful regimental 
ardour was at bursting point as the fun, as they called it, was loudly commented upon, that would be experienced 
when the row began and bullets were flying thick.
</p>
<p>
Little cared the Signor for Maori fighting then, but as his ear caught some youngster’s silly remark anent 
“wigs on the green” he thought how he should feel indebted to the foe if a certain wig that fitted the hat 
he had seen tha morning were laid low through them.
</p>
<p>
An irresistible wave of malevolence raged through him at this thought as he muttered under his breath, “And, 
by Jove! I’ll join the Maories myself before I’m baulked should to-morrow bring me defeat.”
</p>
<p>
His moody watching was in time rewarded by the sight, first of the Major moving in and out in critical survey 
amongst the squads drilling on the parade ground, and shortly afterwards by that of the other absentee, who 
came carelessly strolling through the gate with a pleasant smile and a nod for everyone in his path, the 
tell-tale hat thrust back on his curly head and looking as happy, handsome, and good-natured a fellow as lover 
could wish to see or rival fear.
</p>
<p>
He noticed Fraser as he lightly sprang up the verandah steps with the usual friendly nod and salutation, in 
recognition of which he received something that sounded very like a malediction which very nearly made him 
stop. A rapid second thought however bade him continue on to the mess-room wondering what had made the man 
so extra savage that morning.
</p>
<p>
The irrepressible Boots saved him the trouble of starting that subject, by exclaiming as soon as he saw him, 
“I say Brett, what have you been doing to our noble foreigner? Relations strained eh? Since he went out just 
before you to-day he bas lost what little civility he had left. Talk about snubbing, one gets much worse than 
that now in real, ripe double-shotted Roman.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s queer,” replied Jack, “I was just going to ask some of you chaps about that. As I passed him only a 
moment since, in exchange for my polite salutation I got what sounded like a very liberal cursing. Committed 
any more little indiscretions, Reggie?”
</p>
<p>
“Not I,” replied the youngster. “I don’t intend to either. One edition like the last is enough for me. But we 
really thought that you had put the Signor’s nose out of joint somehow or other and drew our conclusions from 
seeing you both steering the same course this morning.”
</p>
<p>
Then seeing Jack make an involuntary motion of disapproval he continued apologetically, “There, I won’t ask any 
more questions. I’m always saying too much, can’t help it somehow.”
</p>
<p>
The news came as a sudden revelation to Jack and made him thoughtful for the moment. It perhaps would account 
for the morning’s mysteries.
</p>
<p>
“What if the Signor,” thought he, “was the unknown individual to whom old Peterkin had found it so perplexing 
to give an answer; and if so, what was that question he had asked? Yes it must have been Fraser who was in the 
‘den’ that very morning: and what if the old man had looked favourably upon what he was sure had been the request?” 
</p>
<p>
“What a fool I was, not to go to Peterkin and secure his good word on the spot,” continued he, “Bother it all! 
I hope there is no harm done.”
</p>
<p>
Reggie Bareham was not slow in noticing the cloud that had overshadowed his friend and fearing that he must have 
been its cause he drew Jack into an adjoining room and as soon as they found themselves alone with many excuses 
disburdened his mind.
</p>
<p>
I’m so sorry,” said he, “I didn’t mean to annoy you, it’s all my confounded tongue that will run off with me 
at any moment. I’d made up my mind to see you alone but must needs let off before all the chaps. You won’t mind. 
Will you?—my saying that all along I’ve watched you and Miss Peterkin with a dead certainty of what would come 
about. Don’t think it impertinent, but really it must have been quite as apparent to many others. I also saw 
what you didn’t I fancy, that there was another ‘Richmond’ in the field, and many a time I’ve seen him take 
interest in your proceedings, but it was not till I got into yesterday’s shindy that I thought of warning you. 
That involuntary outburst told its tale, and his glance when I suggested in joke that someone had cut him out 
showed what mercy anyone would get who stood in his way. It was, Jack, a very devil of a look. I shall never 
forget it. For the moment it was too malignant that its mere recollection makes me shudder every time I pass 
its owner. I know he’ll do some great mischief one of these days. He can’t help it, it’s born in him. This 
morning strolling on the hill I happened to see you two go to Peterkin’s almost together, and from Fraser 
returning alone in such a diabolical temper I concluded that you must have had an unpleasant minute or two 
with him there.”
</p>
<p>
“No, my dear boy, I never saw him,” replied Jack, “but his presence there explains, though it doesn’t clear 
up, something that has puzzled me a great deal. And thank you for your care of me. I know it springs from 
true regard, and now, I don’t mind telling you, but don’t let it go further till you get the word, that it 
is as you think with Miss Peterkin and me. As for Fraser with his likes and dislikes I don’t care a pin. Let 
him play fairly or otherwise, I’m not alarmed, though I must say there are many men who would be much pleasanter 
to fight than he. I know his measure to a shave and don’t fear his malice in the least, and further whilst 
I’m in the humour I’ll go and have it out with him for cursing me.”
</p>
<p>
Jack turned to leave the room when “Boots” burst in suddenly with:
</p>
<p>
“For Heaven’s sake don’t go and quarrel with him, Brett! You can’t imagine what mischief I’m always fancying 
about that man, and it’s not open danger that I fear. I tell you that I have developed a perfect horror of 
him and his ways. I don’t think I’m really afraid of anything living or dead but of him, and that I can’t help. 
He will be mixed up in our future somehow I feel sure, and in no pleasant manner either, so for goodness’ sake 
don’t tackle him before that time comes.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” said Jack laughing lightly at the boy’s fears. “Perhaps it will be as well, so I won’t say anything 
now, but let the beggar go his own way while I go mine. But by Jingo! I’ll stand no more swearing quietly.”
</p>
<p>
The two then, arm in arm, returned to the anteroom, where the first individual who accosted them was the very 
one they had just been discussing. To their great surprise they found that he had sought them to make excuses 
for the hasty language he had used to Jack in the verandah, saying that at the time he was so much bothered 
with something on his mind that he didn’t know what he said.
</p>
<p>
Jack, cheerfully accepted the explanation whilst “Boots” whose presence was completely ignored, absolutely 
whistled with surprise, and, as Fraser passed on he said to his companion, “I don’t think it is on record that 
an apology ever came from that quarter before. I should feel much safer under an extra anathema or two. Be careful 
Jack, old fellow; he has not put himself in the wrong for nothing.
</p>
<p>
“As for me, did you remark? I’m not considered worth powder and shot, but all the same I feel sure that he 
would not be displeased to insert some of the latter in my unfortunate carcass. He would murder me if he 
dared, I’m confident.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t talk such rubbish, Reggie, he can do you no harm beyond being disagreeable so think no more about him. 
But there goes the first mess bugle. I’m off to dress and if you don’t want to be late you will do the same.”
</p>
<p>
That evening the dinner passed off in a much more lively manner than usual, the whole regiment being in high 
spirits at the thoughts of getting into action at last. Even Fraser seemed to catch the general enthusiasm 
conversing specially with Jack Brett who honestly returned his advances, and although he never suspected any 
scheming, his “fidus Achates” did, and closely did Reggie Bareham watch the course of the newfound friendship.”
</p>
<p>
He soon noticed that the Signor during the whole evening, never once let his friend out of his sight until he 
saw him safely within the doors of his own rooms for the night, then he surlily retired himself, eased in mind 
to think that at least if he were not winning Jack was not making any running either.
</p>
<p> 
Jealously as he was exercised with anticipations for the morrow he slept but badly that night and in his 
restlessness his heated vision saw fair pictures of his rival and Jemima happy and contented in each other’s 
love, and himself a wretched outcast, despised and pitied, for his failure, and over and over again he
vowed that it should not be till after he had exhausted all his resources of interference that these pictures 
should become reality.
</p>
<p>
The next morning, the minute that parade was over, without even waiting to change his clothes, he went straight 
off to the Lodge for the decision of his fate and was duly ushered into the “den” where he found the old 
gentleman awaiting him smoking vigorously in front of a half-consumed jorum of rum and water standing on the 
plain boarded table.
</p>
<p>
The state of the room plainly showed that that had not been his only occupation; all his pet objects, instead 
of being neatly and handily in their places, were lying about anyhow, taken down from their niches without any 
object and left anywhere. 
</p>
<p>
The master was in fact in a great state of mental perturbation, more so indeed than the day before. He had made 
sure that the time of reprieve he had exacted from the Signor would have furnished him with some sort of answer 
to his embarrassing applications, that during the lull, certain desirable revelations would have been made which 
in themselves would have supplied a convincing response. 
</p>
<p>
He had thought that Jemima, Jack, or someone, no matter who, would have brought him the news he was so anxious 
to get and remained in the “den” some hours longer than usual so as to be in the way when wanted. 
</p>
<p> 
At last his impatience mastered him and off he stepped on a voyage of discovery for himself and found the two 
ladies quietly seated in the boudoir, who in spite of the plainest of hints seemed to have nothing particular 
to say beyond that Brett had not been able to stop on account of being due for some duty. 
</p>
<p>
That morning, in despair of getting any assistance from his people, he early sought inspiration amongst his 
beloved relics unconsciously handling and displacing them till all was in a state of confusion similar to that 
of his own mind but at last he deserted his playthings and with a groan of “Worse luck” he took a pull at his 
grog, fixed his pipe more firmly and sat down to await his visitor.
</p>
<p>
It was at that very moment that Fraser made his appearance, and seizing upon the old man’s remark for a 
conversational opening as he shook hands he briskly said:
</p>
<p> 
“Good morning, Sir! And what’s the matter with luck this morning? Surely you haven’t to complain of that 
unequally distributed commodity? Hope it isn’t mine that is on the decline.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know anything about your luck,” said the host testily and without rising. “All I know is that 
everything about this house seems to have gone mad, and getting worse every moment. I’ll be hanged if there’s 
a sane person about the shanty or even visiting it.”
</p>
<p>
This petulant sally of the old whaler emphasized as it was with professional flourishes of a favourite harpoon 
that stood to hand, did not have the smallest effect on the listener who contented himself with smilingly 
inquiring “if he were not considered sane?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” was the immediate unceremonious return, snappy and rude, “Not one bit more than any other chap that 
comes loafing round here. ‘Pon my soul you are not so sane as most of them or you wouldn’t come bothering 
for an answer I don’t want to give—That’s plain—Why, in the name of goodness can’t you fellows leave me 
and my girl alone?”
</p>
<p>
In his strong disinclination to give Fraser anything but an unfavourable answer Peterkin had managed to walk 
himself into a sort of injured feeling, with no fixed aim, though perhaps in it there lurked a sort of 
calculation that an exhibition of temper might disgust his visitor and choke him off; but in that he had 
sadly mistaken his man, who not disturbed in the slightest degree calmly responded:
</p>
<p>
“I can assure you, Sir, that I’m sorry indeed to be a bother. Perhaps I should have done better to ascertain 
Miss Peterkin’s sentiments before coming to you, and that might have—though I have not the boldness to think 
so—precluded the necessity of troubling further. I thought however that it was due to you to first ascertain 
your ideas as to my fitness to be your daughter’s husband, and hope I have satisfied you.”
</p>
<p>
Seeing the old man half turn away with a most rudely evident shrug, Fraser continued with rising heat, though 
struggling hard to control his infirmity of temper that he felt getting the better of him. “But pardon my saying 
that even if I am not fortunate enough to obtain your good word I must strive my utmost to win Miss Peterkin. 
Indeed, Sir, I love her too much to give her up with life. I can’t and won’t! I’m sure you would not refuse your 
sanction should Miss Jemima desire it as I do. I must and will have her!” he cried, getting more and more excited 
with his own speech. “I can’t do without her now and if she is not to be mine she shall be no one else’s.”
</p>
<p>
Every fighting drop of the old sailor’s blood rose at this passionate declamation. The crimson battle flag 
showed defiantly in his flushed face as he glared in heated indignation at his visitor, struggling hard to 
overcome the jealous excitement that had served him so badly.
</p>
<p>
Fraser had seen in a moment the damage he had done and with numerous apologies endeavoured to lessen the effect 
of his unlucky burst of nature, but it was no use, for apart from just resentment Peterkin saw his chance and 
determined to avail himself of it and cutting short the flow of explanation he burst out scornfully:
</p>
<p>
“Hoity-toity! That’s tall talk from a stranger asking a favour!—And you’ll have my girl whether I like it or 
not. Will you? And murder anybody who may be selected in preference to your pompous self, eh! I’ll recollect 
that for further use in case anyone should lose the number of his mess. You’ll have lots of practice if you 
have to settle all who are fond of Jemima.”
</p>
<p>
A short pause for breath ensued but before Fraser could say a word the irate old fellow followed up bitterly:
</p>
<p>
” I like your style of courting immensely, there’s no awkward bashfulness about it. I only wish that you would 
go and tell my girl half you have said to me. I should have nothing to fear about the result, and since you 
have been so kind as to threaten to totally disregard me if I don’t do what you want, I think I’ll give you the 
chance—No I won’t though,” said he, suddenly stopping and thinking for a moment. “I promised that you should 
see her and I scorn to go back on my word whatever happens. But I tell you plainly, Captain Fraser, that I am 
in hopes that a man I like much better than you, will secure, if he has not already done so, the affections of 
my daughter.”
</p>
<p>
This was indeed bitter to the listener who with lowering brows essayed to speak, but fruitlessly, for Peterkin 
was thoroughly wound up for the occasion and would not be denied.
</p>
<p> 
“Now don’t interrupt me,” he continued, “or you shall not put your chance to the test at all. I’ve promised that 
you shall have the same chance of winning as any other man. And further I say again that the girl shall decide 
for herself and her choice is mine and her mother’s. Now don’t speak any more or I might change my mind, but be 
off, find the girl, and do your best. You need not look me up after you’ve got your answer. I know what it will 
be now. But recollect another thing I told you yesterday, namely, that the girl’s negative must be taken for 
good and all. If it isn’t I shall have something more to say. There go. I’ve said all I mean to, and may be a 
little too much, but I mean it all.”
</p>
<p>
Ironically bowed out, Fraser heartily cursing the hasty temper that had exposed him to such an experience of 
shameful vituperation, that he never could have believed himself capable of enduring, proceeded in an angry 
but resolute frame of mind, backed up by his never-failing assurance, down the passage to the boudoir.
</p>
<p>
He was his vigorous self again before he had gone ten steps. He had been rudely handled but yet might avoid 
defeat. He <em>could not</em> stand that. The old man’s jeering had made him feel ten thousand times more 
the necessity of scoring a victory. The stinging jibes he had suffered with strange effect on his wild 
unbalanced nature had spurred him to imagine that he loved Jemima with more maddening fervour than ever, and 
yet that love now acted but as a secondary impulse. The premier was that inordinate overpowering arrogant 
self-estimation that he could not control, that would brook no yielding to either man or circumstance without 
the bitterest strife. “Circumstances might conquer” thought he. “They might keep beyond his control, but no 
man should bring about for him such degrading failure and triumph in it.” Determining grimly thus, unthinkingly, 
without even the ceremony of knocking, he burst into the ladies’ sanctum whither no one penetrated save by favour.
</p>
<p> 
He found here Mrs. Peterkin and her three Maori friends in solemn conclave, and as the old lady started to her 
feet on his unexpected intrusion, Fraser saw in her flashing looks the mistake he had made, that his wretched 
ungovernable temper had arraigned against him a hitherto neutral force upon which he had counted, not a little, 
to help him to stem the flowing tide of disaster.
</p>
<p>
Stammering out a confused apology in answer to Matu-huere’s inquiring looks, he informed her that her husband 
had sent him to find her daughter, and then not seeing her there, he respectfully inquired where she was.
</p>
<p> 
Without noticing his excuses she answered in as curt a manner as possible and in tones of unmistakable unwelcome 
that Jemima was in the garden, where she might be found if her father’s permission had been obtained.
</p>
<p>
This reception, though provoked, and the pronounced contemptuous hostility of the old lady’s answer was almost 
too much for Fraser, to whose lips there arose a retort which even the certainty of total discomfiture scarcely 
was able to suppress. That a parcel of “niggers” should treat him thus was almost too much, and for the first 
time in his life he made a sacrifice to his masterfulness, with a great effort thrust back the surging 
retort, hurriedly thanked the speaker and left the room for the garden in search of the girl.

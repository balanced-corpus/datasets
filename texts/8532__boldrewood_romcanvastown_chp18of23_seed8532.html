<title>Chapter 18 of A Romance of Canvas Town by Boldrewood</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- Chapter of 1 of the fourth story -->
<p>I was at my wits’ end. I was almost at the conclusion of my stay in town. I had been searching diligently from the first day of my arrival for a young woman (we had had enough of old ones) who would consent, for a liberal wage, to proceed to Bundaburramah, and there go through the form of cooking our food. I say, go through the form. My wife and I, taught by long intervals of self-help, were not exacting. I could broil chops and steaks fairly well. I could put a piece of corned beef into a pot, and leave it to simmer when I retired for the night. I
could manage potatoes. But my free spirit rebelled at the “washing up.” The half-used plates and dishes were to me as things loathsome. They operated prejudicially upon my dinners in prospect even, as well as upon those which had “gone before.” So, as a man, a gentleman, and a squatter, I “jacked up” at the cookery.</p>
<p>My poor Isabel tried it many times; and I am bound to say, as a truthful though oppressed employer, accomplished miracles. But the children could not be kept out of the kitchen when mamma
was so delightfully engaged. Narrow escapes occurred of cremation of little dresses, and the little treasures contained therein. And how could I bear to find my dainty darling, hot, uncomfortable, and perfumed as to her peerless person, not with lavender or mille-fleurs, but actually, as her younger brother roughly expressed it, “smelling of fat”?</p>
<p>We tried men cooks, but they were surly or drunken. We placed occasionally adjacent bushgirls between us and the unwonted toils and miseries. They augmented the toils by their awkwardness. They sharpened the misery by their waste, extravagance, and sudden abscondings. And this is how it all came to pass.</p>
<p>While at our worst, I received a sudden summons to town on business.</p>
<p>“I am sorry to leave you, my dearest,” said I, as I bade farewell to my tearful wife. “I feel almost cowardly in going away to a region where cooks can still be obtained for money. I shall, in spite of myself, be revelling in hotel banquets, and real actual dinners (not meals) ; while you, my poor darling, will be dwelling in the desert alone, subsisting upon the burned chop, the underdone ‘gigot,’ the unleavened bread. My heart bleeds for you. Why did I ever marry you?” Here the mail, which passes our door, came rapidly towards us.</p>
<p>“Oh, Edward!” said she, hiding her face in my breast, “don’t say such dreadful things. But you will bring up a cook from town, won’t you, like a dear? I am willing to do my best, but I am almost worn
out.” Here the up-mail drove up.</p>
<p>“If I do not,” said I, “may I—” here I swore an oath, not too dreadful to repeat, for I remembered I was a family man, and member of the local school board, in the midst of my natural indignation—”be
forced to sell Bundaburramah, and turn mining agent, stockbroker, or even member of parliament. If I do return alive, and if there is only one cook in the whole metropolis, that cook shall be yours.”</p>
<p>She thanked me with one half-bright glance from her tender brown eyes. I climbed to the box seat, the impatient leader reared, the off-side wheeler stubbornly refused to move, the near-side one gave a
playful kick, and in about ten minutes we were fairly off.</p>
<p>I reached the metropolis after a journey during which even the modest fare of the roadside inns appeared to me in the light of astonishing delicacies, so unaccustomed had I been, of late, to the most rudimentary results of the culinary art. I may mention that I had not left Bundaburramah for three years previously; domestic difficulties, and a certain disobligingness on the part of my banker, being both in favour of home-keeping. Though the latter conflicting element was in a state of unwonted rest, the domestic difficulties were as sharp as ever. The general prosperity seemed to have intensified them. What was the use of my getting grand prices for my
wool and sheep if my wife was to be the slave of the lamp, as the man says in the <em>Arabian Nights</em>, or, rather, of the saucepan?—flesh and blood couldn’t stand it. I am a moderate man, and believe in the liberty of the subject, and all that, but fancy a cargo of nice strong young slaves just arrived, with a score of cooks among them! Wouldn’t I have bid up? Yes, I grieve to say—like Mr. Salem Scudder
himself.</p>
<p>I was almost comforted when we pulled up, or rather, the train stopped at the refreshment station on the mountains. “Come,” I said to myself, “this is something like. Here is no violent contrast here to
shock the consciences of men long ignorant of cooks! The Government have shown their usual delicacy of feeling. Nothing but bread and butter, the mature sandwich, the almost warm tea and coffee. No wicked wine or spirits.” I fed uncomfortably, as I had done for years, and felt free from the crime of wallowing in luxury, while my absent spouse was alternately starving or suffering from indigestion.</p>
<p>Sydney at length. More temptation, with the usual human result—more indulgence. I sinned and sorrowed. Daily I feasted on fish, soup, and entrees, nightly I bewailed my guilty pleasure, and excused myself to my absent sufferer, by ingenious explanations, in which figured the recovery of a lost palate, and a stern determination to wrest a cook from the clutches of the registry office-keepers, or to stay in Sydney till I did.</p>
<p>To this end I visited every one of those remarkable establishments, where domestics have of late years condescended to meet for the purpose of selecting employers. Daily I presented myself for inspection by the proud daughters of the kitchen—alas! unavailingly.</p>
<p>My appearance, I flatter myself, is not unimpressive. A judicious mixture of paternal benevolence, with the merest <em>soupçon</em> of dignity, has always marked my manner, more especially with the younger
and better-looking female domestics. Wages, if not altogether “of no object,” were decidedly liberal. The duties certainly comprised a fair knowledge of cookery, but the sum was not high. No willing student of
ordinary intelligence could be plucked. We saw no company. Old Jubley, P.M., once a month, a wandering squatter, and a rare inspector of stock, were our only guests.</p>
<p>I did not particularly care what they got, as I, in my turn, took my chance of compulsory potluck when travelling. “Why then this morbid
hatred of the fox? Why did I always break down on the cross-examination? Why was the invariable answer of the young and giggling, the middle-aged and wary, the old and vinous aspirant, ‘That she was
afraid the place wouldn’t suit’?” In other words, why couldn’t I get a cook? The distance, no doubt, was the fatal objection—two hundred and twenty miles. I couldn’t decently make it less than that, though I softened the last mail stage. Then the name—Bundaburramah—confound it! it had the smack of the Lower Darling.</p>
<p>I thought seriously of changing it into Belvoir, or Hampton Court, when I saw the effect it had upon the countenances of the most likely candidates. The way the more smartly dressed among them used to
bring out, “The bush! oh! I’m afraid it’s a great deal too far off.”</p>
<p>Some made such a point of going to church regularly every Sunday, that I regretted that I had not subscribed munificently to that Wesleyan edifice, which might have been completed now, under other
circumstances; that is, if there had been a sufficiency of Wesleyans in the neighbourhood, which it afterwards turned out there were not. For the first few days, I did not mind it so much ; I went as a regular thing to the next registry office on my list. I had checked
them all down in my pocket-book. I was, indeed, so constant an attendant at these exasperating domestic clubs, popularly supposed to tend to the distribution of servants, but in reality being secret
societies for the circulation of gossip, and the intimidation of employers, that I began to be taken for a relation of some of the young persons. Little notice was therefore bestowed upon me, and I heard as many pieces of private intelligence and unmasked conversation, bearing upon the manners and customs of the species female servant, as if I had been the “amateur casual” himself. I was not, however, as yet satiated with the pleasures of the metropolis, and day by day I resumed my stereotyped inquiry of the politely indifferent lady registrars, and kept guard for the regulation period until we all (I was getting quite identified with the ways of the societies) went home to lunch, after which, few of us troubled the
institution again that day.</p>
<p>Obviously, however, this mode of life could not last for ever. I had merged my whole existence and staked my reputation for success upon this mad quest for a cook.</p>
<p>From that fleeting delusive form I was apparently as far as the crowd of fated worshippers in Noel Paton’s grand picture, “The Pursuit of Pleasure.” I could, perhaps, have supported the <em>ennui</em> and fatigue of another month’s quest with the aid of fresh and congenial society, the theatres and concerts by night, an occasional voyage to Manly Beach and the Garden promenade. But other forces began to manifest themselves. My wife’s letters, at first full of sympathy
with my ardent pursuit, began to show first incredulity, then disapproval.</p>
<p>“She was afraid I was not trying in earnest, or else I must have got a cook by this time. Then, was I going to take up my abode in Sydney altogether, and leave my family and the station to take care of
itself? She must say she thought it strange, to say the least of it, that I should have been in Sydney a whole month and have done nothing. If I did not return soon, she thought she would start down with
the children in the mail. Besides, there had been a bush-fire, some of the sheep were away, and she was afraid the overseer had been drinking.”</p>
<p>Alas! alas! (as I am writing and not talking I may make use of this interjection) how my enjoyment shrivelled up, as grass before a bush-fire, under the last paragraph! Human nature is weak.</p>
<p>Here had I gone on, patiently searching for this philosopher’s stone of a cook, while my stock was decreasing, my wife becoming deranged, and my overseer in a chronic state of delirium tremens. I knew that nothing short of this stage would have aroused her suspicions. Off I must go, cookless and hopeless, by Saturday’s mail. Words fail to describe my humiliation and despair. “Why did I not marry a cook?” I asked myself in my agony. I have seen those of that persuasion that were fair to look upon. Then should I have been saved this anguish, this degradation, this mental, physical, moral, most complicated misery!</p>
<p>Friday arrived. I had advertised from the first day of my visit, directing applicants, with bitter irony, to call between nine and ten o’clock at the Royal Hotel, that being the hour when I am immersed in
the morning papers. I was not reading, far from it, but, with corrugated brow, considering how many of my commissions, left to the last moment, it would be safe to neglect, when, enter the waiter.</p>
<p>“A young person has called, sir, about the situation as cook.”</p>
<p>“What!” said I, “show in the angel—I mean the young woman.” In a few moments, however, my spirits fell—”She will leave me, as other hopes have left before,” I murmured; “why should I be so ridiculous as to expect anything but disappointment, a little more ingenious than usual? Here she comes.”</p>
<p>The door opened. A young woman of twenty, very quietly dressed, presented herself, with an air of slight timidity, rather different from the assured elegance to which I had been accustomed.</p>
<p>“Pray take a chair,” said I. “I understood that you had come with reference to my advertisement for a cook?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Steadman,” said she, “of Bundaburramah?” inquiringly.</p>
<p>“The same,” said I, breaking out into a cold perspiration—(She’s going to ask whether it is at the North Shore, or what the distance from town is).</p>
<p>She did nothing of the sort. She took from her black bag a letter which she handed to me. As soon as my trepidation permitted, I read it. I knew the handwriting well. It was from a dear old family
friend, who had known me from a boy, a lady, though of warm benevolence, not less noted for clear-sighted dislike to imposition. It ran as follows: “I willingly testify that Mary Dale has a thorough practical knowledge of cookery. I consider her likely to prove
valuable to any family in which she may engage herself. I have known her for some years, and vouch for her perfect trustworthiness.”</p>
<p>I looked up from this document as the ruined heir lifts his eyes from his grandfather’s long-lost (favourable) will. My glance encountered a look of mingled expectation and anxiety. The face itself
was a good one. Clear dark eyes, fair features, well-kept, neatly-arranged hair. “Fully good-looking enough,” thought I; “thorough knowledge of cooking—too good to be true—must end in failure.”</p>
<p>“Hem—ha!” said I. “Very good character Mrs. Longworth gives you here. How long will you engage for? Not less than six months?”</p>
<p>“I am willing to engage myself for twelve months,” said she.</p>
<p>I gave myself a severe pinch at this statement. I must be dreaming, or is she an escaped lunatic? Or, somehow, the wording of Mrs. Longworth’s letter is rather ambiguous. No allusion to other places.
Is there anything—hum—ha?</p>
<p>“You have been cook in other families, I suppose?” said I, with an easy air of unconcern. “Where Mrs. Longworth acquired her knowledge of you?”</p>
<p>She was slightly confused, as I thought, for a moment, then looked up and said steadily:</p>
<p>“I have never been away from home before; but I can cook very fairly, as Mrs. Longworth has kindly stated. If you do not approve of my work after a month, you need not pay me.”</p>
<p>I hesitated, only for a moment. There was a little mystery; but in one second there flashed across my mind the tremendous extent, the ruinous depth of the domestic gap that this female Curtius was volunteering to close by self-sacrifice. I looked at her clear eyes and earnest face. I call myself a bit of a physiognomist. The die was cast.</p>
<p>“It is arranged,” I said. “Our wages are so-and-so for twelve months.”</p>
<p>She inclined her head.</p>
<p>“Will you meet me with your trunk at the terminus at five o’clock to-morrow afternoon?”</p>
<p>‘I shall be sure to be punctual, sir,” she said, in a pleased voice, and departed.</p>
<p>I never missed a train in my life, though not punctual to a fault. I sometimes linger, I often procrastinate. But I contrive to energise as the time grows short. I double the cabman’s fare. I omit my least important (family) commissions. By this process of addition and subtraction, I have hitherto avoided failure.</p>
<p>But on this momentous occasion I ran no imprudent risks. There are moments in life when, stupendous issues being involved, no sane man
leaves anything to chance.</p>
<p>I was more than prepared. I went down to the terminus after breakfast, and set my watch by the railway time. I mustered my parcels in the most methodical way, and arrived with them hours beforehand. I dined sparingly, lest caution should be lulled by liquor, and half an hour before the five-twenty train, I was wandering up and down the
platform, arousing the interest of the railway officials. One of them, expectant of subsidy, touched his hat, as he asked, pointing to my luggage, which included bandboxes—”Was there a lady in the case?” “Yes, there was.”</p>
<p>The appointed time drew nigh ; but five minutes, at the expiration of which the inexorable train would start. Already the warning cry of “Take your seats for” was heard. Anxious or timid passengers hastened to ensconce themselves in the carriages. I had taken two first-class tickets; I had seen my multifarious packages, comprising all things
indispensable to the home-returning paterfamilias, from a crate of crockery to a box of toys, safely bestowed. I am aware that second-class accommodation is usually considered suitable for domestic
servants ; but I was not going to be trammelled by the usages of a bygone state of society, where cooks were doubtless plentiful and easy to replace. No! Was I to run the risk of a headlong proposal from
a fortunate miner? An offer of double wages from a desperate employer like myself? No! By the recollection of my past anguish, by the dread of a servantless period to come, I would run no insane risks. “Safe bind, safe find.” Once in my charge, this gifted maiden should be guarded and cherished as a ward in Chancery, until I deposited her with triumph in the kitchen at Bundaburramah. But was she coming after all? Agonising doubt! I felt as if the disappointment would shatter my overtasked faculties.</p>
<p>All fears on that score were set at rest by the appearance of the inestimable maid, accompanied by an elderly woman of great respectability of aspect, who looked at me keenly, as I hurriedly advanced.</p>
<p>I could have clasped her (our new cook, I mean) in my arms. But I controlled all outward signs of joy, and calling a porter directed him to take charge of the moderate-sized trunk that the cabman deposited on the pavement.</p>
<p>“Here is your ticket; perhaps you had better take your seat,” said I, leading the way to a saloon carriage.</p>
<p>“I am sorry to be late,” said she; “but I am quite ready now. Good-bye!” Here she spoke in low tones to the elderly person, who by this time, from the attention she bestowed upon me, must have had a correct mental photograph of my features and expression.</p>
<p>“You can tell them you saw me safely off.”</p>
<p>“Good-bye, my dear child,” said the old woman.</p>
<p>I discovered no family likeness. I opened the carriage door a little impatiently, pointing out an unoccupied corner, of which Mary quietly took possession—the signal sounded, and, joy of joys! we were off.</p>
<p>When the “gentlemanly” dealer in <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>, who bought his slaves in small parcels, a wife here, a husband there, a child somewhere else, as prices suited, had got his valuable lots safely on board the steamer, he (erroneously, as it turned out) relaxed his watchfulness, under the impression that they couldn’t
very well get way. Here let me remark that I at least never for a moment wondered why the Southerners fought so desperately for their slaves. Could I not enter into their feelings? Had I been possessed of—say inherited—a good cook or two, a housemaid, a prize laundress, would I not have shed the last drop of blood ere they should be torn from me. Don’t tell me! human nature is the same everywhere. Wilberforce himself would have done it, had he been the prey of servants and the scorn of registry offices.</p>
<p>But <em>revenons à nos moutons</em>, or to the artist mostly concerned with the post-mortem experiments made on their hapless bodies.</p>
<p>I sat within a convenient distance of my prize, and only occasionally satisfied myself by a cautious glance that she was there. I fancied that a look of regret had succeeded the one of quiet determination which I had remarked upon her face as she ascended
the platform. “Only natural,” thought I; “but she can’t well draw back now. She doesn’t look the sort of damsel to burst into tears, and entreat to be sent back to her mother. No! I think I’ve made a hit for once. Quietly dressed, in a well-fitting, almost too plain material. Gloves, yes; all the world wears gloves now; a pair of half- worn
gauntlets, very sensible. Hat, unobtrusive; veil, thick and defensive. Hem! most unexceptional attire.”</p>
<p>Worn out by my late severe mental conflicts, I must have dozed, for I was suddenly awakened by the stopping of the train at the half-way station, where refreshments are popularly supposed to be obtainable. I went over to her. “Mary,” said I, “do you feel hungry? would you like anything to eat or drink?”</p>
<p>She started slightly as I spoke; then with an effort, said, “Thank you, Mr. Steadman, I should like a cup of coffee.” The refreshment was procured, and I thought it a suitable occasion to ask if she felt rested, and ready to take the coach journey, which commenced at midnight.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said, “I am quite well, and I daresay I can manage it.”</p>

<!-- Chapter II <br> The Concert. -->
<p>As the days went on, the excitement increased among those who were to perform in aid of Mr. Marlowe’s painted window. At first there had been some little discussion as to the locality.</p>

<p>“Of course it will be at the Town Hall here,” the majestic Mrs. Nevil had assumed, that day wh en Mr. Marlowe rode over to consult her. Her daughter’s singing warranted any expectations of an audience. “You see, Mr. Marlowe, the tradespeople and persons of
that sort have had no opportunity of hearing May sing (except, of course, in church, where her voice is drowned by the others); and they would doubtless, and very naturally, feel aggrieved if they were, so to say, shut out—as. they would be if she went off to exhibit her powers in your little schoolhouse.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nevil, sitting back in her thronelike chair, her jewelled fingers gleaming as she stitched at some church embroidery, considered the matter settled; and Mr. Marlowe, somewhat crestfallen, rode back to Alveston to carry the intelligence to his wife.</p>

<p>“I suppose you said the Town Hall was impossible,”said Mrs. Marlowe placidly.</p>

<p>The Rev. Josiah was in considerable consternation. He had not seen, and moreover he could not see, why the concert should not be in the Town Hall at Upchurch.</p>

<p>“But I do,” said his wife. “And so would you if you had any sense. We want to make Alveston a place of itself, instead of a neglected suburb of Upchurch. The Upchurchers are to recognise us—we are not going to swell their importance. However, leave it to me. I shall drive over and call upon Mrs. Nevil ;” which she did next day.</p>

<p>“I always liked Mary Marlowe,” said Mrs. Nevil to her husband when the family were assembled in the drawing-room after dinner on the day Mrs. Marlowe had paid her visit. “Blood will tell. She is so full of aspiration. How she can have married that insignificant little man, who is always darting about with that big head and little body of his, just like a tadpole, as if he didn’t know what he was or where he was going, I can’t imagine.”</p>

<p>“If you are speaking of Marlowe, my dear,” and the ascetic face of the honourable and reverend Nevil appeared above the evening paper as his slow bass tones were launched into the room, “I consider him well-meaning, very well-meaning indeed. If an insignificant labourer, still a labourer with a will to work honestly in the vineyard.”</p>

<p>“Yes, to get as many of the big grapes for himself as he can. All he thinks of is how much he can make by the sale of the tickets. Now his wife is so different. It was quite edifying this afternoon, she was so simple and unaffectedly earnest. ‘Of course, dear Mrs. Nevil, your will is our law,’ she said to me, with quite touching gratitude (Mary Marlowe is one of the very few grateful persons I know). ‘But may I tell you why the idea of a concert came to Josiah at all?’ And she explained the fearfully savage state of Alveston when they came to the place. There was hardly a congregation, and none of the men ever went to church, and when they first began to attend the services they lounged about and spat and grinned, perverted by that fearful man at the Hall. The first point to be gained was to get them to honour the House of God, and to achieve that, Mary Marlowe has really suffered a martyrdom.”</p>

<p>“But what of the concert, my dear?”</p> 
  
<p>Mr. Nevil had listened, contemplating the first wood-fire of the autumn with a lofty patience.</p>

<p>“My love, <i>will</i> you allow me to speak?”</p>
  
<p>“Certainly.” The clergyman bowed his head and resignedly laid his paper on his knees.</p>

<p>“If you will not interrupt, you will understand. Mary Marlowe recognises that art should be pressed into the service of religion. She said that dear May’s voice would humanize the people. Of course the people of Alveston would never take the trouble to attend a concert <i>here</i>. They would be glad of the excuse not to come, if five painted windows were in question instead of one. As the concert is in their own schoolhouse they will be shamed into coming. Then Mary Marlowe has at heart the conversion of the atheist’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“I did not think much of her,” said May, yawning.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that tall, handsome girl?” asked Mr. Nevil. “One of the finest walkers I have seen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa! you cannot mean that common creature; she looked like a work-girl dressed up,” suggested the gentle Ella.</p>

<p>“Your papa is very shortsighted, my dear. No matter what the appearance of the girl, she has a human soul to be saved; and for a human soul Mary Marlowe, like any other good clergyman’s wife, would go to the stake.”</p>

<p>“Stakes are out of fashion, so it is easy to talk about them,” said Mr. Nevil, taking up his paper and growing pettish. Pettishness was the one cloud in the clear sky of his scholarly and gentlemanly serenity. “But I cannot see what an amateur concert has to do with converting to Christianity.”</p>

<p>“My dear, like all those learned people, you think in a groove. You will see.”</p>

<p>“See what?” asked the clergyman. Then he buried himself in his paper, Mrs. Nevil looked more dignified even than usual, and resolved to help Mary Marlowe in her laudable ambition.</p>

<p>The Rev. Josiah was disappointed.</p>

<p>“I wish you women would leave business alone,” he said, when his wife told him that Mrs. Nevil perfectly agreed with her that the proper place for the concert was their own schoolhouse. Then it came out that the Hector’s programme had outgrown its schoolhouse limits. He had promised Colonel Farrar—Captain Rawson’s friend—that a certain Miss Morini, a well-known London amateur, should sing—on the strength of which promise a number of tickets had been taken by the military circle.</p>

<p>“It will end in there being no room for the two shilling people; and fancy what those Londoners will think of that little barn of ours!” said the Rector, disconsolately.</p>

<p>It was a sudden tumble for his aspirations. He had already fancied his own compositions reviewed in the <i>Upchurch Gazette</i>: “As the dulcet tones of the exquisite soprano possessed by the esteemed daughter of our revered pastor echoed through the hall, the audience were spell-bound by the composition, which, if we mistake not, we owe to the inspired pen of the Rev. Josiah Marlowe.” Ah! he could imagine what the <i>Upchurch Gazette</i> reporter, who had a trick of writing in “the House that Jack built” style, would make of it. But that untidy-looking young man, who had said, “Certainly, Mr. Marlowe, certainly, sir, with the greatest pleasure in life,” with such alacrity, when the Rector had fished him out of the office of the <i>Gazette</i>, and proposed to talk business over a glass of sherry at the Royal Oak—if he could be coaxed into the schoolhouse—would not be allowed the space or the type for a record of a village concert, which would have been merely that concert’s due if it had taken place in the Upchurch Town Hall.</p>

<p>“It will be a dismal failure,” said Mr. Marlowe gloomily, “and it will end in our being laughed at.”</p>

<p>“The schoolhouse will look charming, my dear.”</p>

<p>Rinaldi had promised to help Mrs. Marlowe with the decorations a few days previously, when he had come from town expressly to call at the Rectory. “Oh yes,” Mrs. Marlowe had thought to herself when the Italian had presented himself, faultlessly dressed, glancing eagerly into the room, then looking disappointed. “He has come to see <i>me</i>, I dare say.”</p>

<p>While she was friendly in a kind, motherly way, she had steered the conversation very neatly towards the subject of Eve Lester, and had soon extracted a semi-declaration of the Italian’s admiration. Then she waxed grave, and lectured the young sculptor. Eve was her special <i>protégée</i>—more particularly as her father was a heathen.</p>

<p>“But you are a Roman Catholic,” she said.</p>

<p>“You confess, and kiss the cross, and eat fish on Fridays.”</p>

<p>She made Rinaldi understand that even with these superstitious drawbacks, he might know that he would owe it to his religion alone, if she countenanced his seeing Eve after the confession of his admiration.</p>

<p>The Italian was excitably, volubly delighted. With Mrs. Marlowe’s help—he thought to himself—he could soon snap his fingers at all “those brothers” whom he believed to be as much in love with Eve as he was himself.</p>

<p>“Ah, madame, but I kiss the cross a hundred thousand times, I confess, I do anything if you let me see her!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marlowe explained that such extremities were unnecessary. Then she gave him a little moral lecture. It was not what he had done, it was what he was going to do, etc.; and they parted with the mutual understanding that at all events the clergyman’s wife did not disapprove of the sculptor as a possible mate for Eve Lester.</p>

<p>“He is well bred, for a foreigner; he has made his name; the Duke of A—— and the Marquis of B—— buy his statues. I am sure it would be quite as good a match as we can expect for the poor dear girl under the circumstances,” Mrs. Marlowe thought, afterwards. Of course, no one in society would ally himself with the daughter of a man who was not only an atheist, .but had brought up his daughter among men in that fashion, no matter what her dowry might be. But Mrs. Marlowe believed as little in Mr. Lester’s wealth as in his philanthropy.</p>
  
<p>So she had no scruple in bringing Eve and Rinaldi together on occasion. She invited them both to luncheon the day of the concert, and afterwards took them to the schoolroom, where they spent the afternoon decorating, with the aid of the schoolmistress, the Rectory gardener and his assistants. Rinaldi was all life and activity, up and down the ladders like a huge monkey, laughing and talking with his mouth full of nails, then helping the schoolmistress to pour out tea, and afterwards wrapping Eve up in Mrs. Marlowe’s waterproof and escorting her back to the Hall under an enormous umbrella, for it was raining. On the way they met Ross. Rinaldi nodded to him with a triumphant glance. Ross just touched his hat and hurried on without looking at Eve.</p>

<p>“I cannot see why that little man likes to be a brother,” said Rinaldi. (There had just been a meeting at the London club, when Mr. Lester’s partner, Mr. Wellbourne, and his brother, went through the formula of being admitted to the Society—”to please my partner, you know, Mr. Linton,” the elder Mr. Wellbourne, a fat good-humoured man, had said to the secretary.)</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Eve. “Mr. Ross is a real brother to the poor.” But she spoke in subdued tones. Why had Ross avoided looking at her? This was the third slight since that evening at the Rectory when he gave her his confidence. How curious it was, she thought—that he should have claimed her as a sister, have told her the story of his tender, wounded heart, then should have, as it were, shrunk away into the merest distant acquaintance!</p>

<p>“Ah, he funny little man, that Ross!” Rinaldi laughed softly at the recollection of the other evening. “They funny fellows, they Mr. Wellbournes and him. They sit and look at us, and not say one word.”</p>

<p>But Eve smiled but faintly at his broken account of the meeting of the Brotherhood. She felt depressed, and went to her room to dress as soon as they arrived at the Hall.</p>

<p>She walked straight to the window. It was twilight. The heavy masses of grey cloud had parted—showing a lake of luminous golden green which was reflected on the wet foliage of the trees, on the clear rain-puddles below, on the garden-walks. A sweet, earthy odour came stealing in through the half-opened casement. A loose trail of ivy fluttered and tapped restlessly in the night-wind that had suddenly arisen and was tossing the branches dry. A faint weird moan—the wind sighed in the wide chimney—and Eve looked suddenly in the glass, starting at the sight of the face with the pale parted lips and round startled eyes, as if suddenly confronted with her own ghost, and as if that ghost had said, “What am I?”</p>

“<p>What am I?” Eve stood wondering what this new self-questioning, selfrealization meant. “Am I beautiful? Am I pleasant?” a rush of questions fled out from her mind, like a flock of startled birds. It was so new, so overpowering, this sudden feverish anxiety about herself, this curiosity and—yes, she acknowledged it—this strong desire to be charming, sweet, as she had felt that other women were.</p>

<p>She lighted her candles, and the yellow light flickered on the image of a grand, womanly form in a loose dark dress, out of which a clear fair face rose straight and white like some delicate blossom towering proudly above a mass of close green foliage. Her quick artistic sense thrilled with satisfaction, but her unselfish nature was wrung with a new, dull pain.</p>

<p>“If I told papa exactly what I felt, he would say it came from being with women. What a cruel thing to be a woman! not to be able to kill and smother your womanly feelings because you don’t know what they are. They are hatched and come to life, you don’t know how or when: there they are, all of a sudden, and you are puzzled what to do with them. There ought to be a dictionary of one’s petty feminine miseries. And this horrid feeling that I want to look as well as that pretty May Nevil to-night—why? What for?” She almost wrung her hands out of sheer disgust. Then she opened her wardrobe, unhooked her dresses and threw them upon the bed, looking askance at the long limp masses of stuff; and after that, taking them up one by one, she smoothed them apologetically—it was a tacit confession of weakness. Eve Lester, choosing a light evening-dress her father had just given her (at Mrs. Wellbourne’s suggestion), and hanging up the rest—felt herself suddenly enfeebled, shorn of her moral strength, “unmanly”—an adjective that danced about her during her dressing like some teasing fly.</p>

<p>Unmanly? Perhaps she would have felt her effeminacy less had she seen the triumphant Rinaldi steering himself through his toilette. Peter had unpacked his portmanteau, and had laid out the guest’s evening things, opening his round eyes at the number of shirts and collars. Peter had not yet learnt that a speck or a crease “not do,” as the sculptor said more decidedly than he ever spoke, when his eyes detected either. To-night Rinaldi first lighted all the candles in the bedroom, then proceeded anxiously to inspect his linen. Three shirts were crumpled up and thrown aside (his habit when he rejected, lest they should appear again), and the same fate awaited a dozen collars. At last he stood contemplating himself in the long glass of the wardrobe, wriggling to see his back in the opposite mirror on the dressing-table. His expression was gloomy and suspicious. He fancied he saw a wrinkle against that left armhole of his evening-coat. Impossible—it must be fancy! The moisture gathered on his forehead—ah, that was all right! He moved—the wrinkle and his frown disappeared simultaneously, as he drew a long breath, and, once more adjusting the coat which had given him such a fright, gazed in satisfaction at his long figure. Sculptor though he was, he had not yet discovered that those lengthy limbs and their large loose joints had a strangely angular, apeish way of moving, which, when he had grinned and his white teeth had glistened as he stood on the ladder that afternoon, had made the schoolmistress think—” Lor! if he isn’t like that big monkey in the Zoological!”</p>
<p>
Eve was just going downstairs as he went from his room. She looked back, upwards. The shaded lamp on the staircase softened her sweet, serious face; she seemed floating down among ethereal, cloudy drapery. Rinaldi forgot himself; his heart beat as he contemplated the future Madame Rinaldi. He must make a statue of her soon—no, at once!</p>

<p>“Ah, mademoiselle!” He stopped, and clasped his hands with an expressive gesture of admiration, hope, respect.</p>

<p>Eve turned and went quickly down—not displeased—an inquiry, ‘Would others think the same?’ flashing through her mind. Mr. Lester came out of the library.</p>

<p>“If we must go to this affair, whatever it is, we must dine at once.”</p>

<p>Something was wrong. Eve and Rinaldi took their places at the dinner-table silently, and Peter moved about with noiseless awe. He knew ” them letters ” he took massa that afternoon had put him out. He was all right then, walking in the garden, his hands behind him (his attitude when content). Yet there was only one letter which might be called business, and in this there was no unpleasant news.</p>

<p>“My dear friend,” was scrawled on the large note used by the firm, in Mr. Wellbourne’s round comfortable-looking handwriting, “what a self-tormentor you are! Did I not tell you the history of those investments the other day from beginning to end? Did I not convince you that the money-market as it appears to the public and as it is to us is as different as the creed of your favourite Pythagoras to his followers, and that same creed to the outer world?</p>

<p>I must not really indulge you in going all over the ground again. Still, if you persist, we will have a repetition, chapter and verse. You know I do not require notes. I should not be successful as I am did not this obliging cranium of mine do duty for any number of ledgers. Choose your own time, therefore. My brother and I hope to be with you on your charming daughter’s birthday,” etc.</p>

<p>It was pleasant, clever, equable, like Mr. Wellbourne himself. Yet Mr. Lester gazed at the letter as if the round Latin characters were hieroglyphics. And the more he gazed the paler and the more anxious grew his face.</p>

<p>“Pale and anxious.” Eve’s verdict as she glanced stealthily at her father from behind the graceful fernery placed in midtable. “Why?” she was inwardly asking, when her father said in a querulous voice:</p>

<p>“Is that the gown Mrs. Wellbourne chose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, papa.”</p>

<p>“But, monsieur, it is—what you say— exquise, superbe.”</p>

<p>“Is it good taste?” Mr. Lester looked at <i>Rinaldi</i>. Rinaldi glanced at Eve. She was unconscious of the subtle slight.</p>

<p>“It is divine!”</p>

<p>The sculptor spoke rapturously, looking towards Eve, who was abstracted. (To her these changeful moods of her father’s were paramount.) “You say, Madame Wellbourne choose it?”</p>

<p>“The wife of my partner.”</p>

<p>“The gentleman who is a brother? Ah, but what a John Bull! He shake your hand so strong. He such a round red face. He good, but not clever, eh?”</p>

<p>Mr. Lester smiled. He was sharpening his carving-knife.</p>

<p>“Eve, do you hear that?”</p>

<p>The young girl started, almost guiltily. Her thoughts had wandered she hardly knew where.</p>

<p>“What—which—papa?”</p>

<p>“Why—Brother Rinaldi’s description of Wellbourne.”</p>

<p>“I have never seen him.”</p>

<p>“Ah, he like one butcher-man, so round, red, kind.” Rinaldi, encouraged by having roused Mr. Lester from his ill-humour, puffed out his cheeks, and gesticulated. “He very rich, is he not? Where it come from? His father rich man?”</p>

<p>“Self-made,” said his host, more himself. Then he described Mr. Wellbourne’s extraordinary career. First, a mere office-boy, accumulating the traditional half-crown; then clerk, saving his firm on emergency by a clever <i>coup</i>; afterwards junior partner, and finally centre and cause of the magnificent success of a firm which had been the envy of the merchant monarchs of the world.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he reanimated; then Rinaldi deftly turned the conversation towards this Madame Wellbourne, who had imagined that lovely drapery.</p>

<p>“When I copy Miss Eve—when I make a statue of mademoiselle—that, sir, is my drapery.”</p>

<p>Eve started.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?” said Mr. Lester ceremoniously. Upon which Rinaldi began to explain.</p>

<p>“A statue of my daughter? You cannot be thinking of what you are saying, Brother Rinaldi.” Mr. Lester brushed a crumb from his sleeve, rose—for dinner was over—and went out.</p>

<p>“What he mean? ah, but mademoiselle!”</p>

<p>Eve’s breast heaved, her downcast eyes looked suspiciously tearful; but she made a brave struggle, and smiling at Rinaldi as she laid her napkin aside, said:</p>

<p>“It is a curious idea for a Brother of Freedom to have.”</p>

<p>“To make a statue of you, mademoiselle! But why?”</p>

<p>“I have the misfortune to be a woman; you may forget it, and papa sometimes—but I? Oh, <i>never!</i>”</p>

<p>Eve rose and looked wistfully at the Italian. He rose immediately, her simple touching beauty as she stood there sorrowful, almost ashamed—enslaving him, making his indignation rise against Mr. Lester for his expressed contempt.</p>

<p>“But, dear lady, <i>I</i> would die for a sweet, good woman.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know there is no such thing?” Eve laughed, with tears in her voice. “You are not a real.brother yet, or you have not learnt your lessons! Fancy asking papa to let you make a statue of a woman!”</p>

<p>“But his daughter—that another thing.”</p>

<p>“I wish I were some one else!” said Eve passionately. “It is my daily, hourly misery that I am not the son my father wants—that he ought to have!”—and she, too, went out.</p>

<p>Rinaldi glanced comically at old Peter, who was brushing the crumbs from the table-cloth.</p>

<p>“Poor Missy Eve!” said the old man in a confidential undertone. “It bad for poor missy to be a girl. Ah, sare, don’t you never speak to massa about the ladies. He not like ‘em. Now, when I had my poor wife—she dead now, poor soul—I never speak to massa ‘bout her.”</p>

<p>“But Miss Eve, she so beautiful, good, Peter.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that all nothing to massa.” Peter shook his grey head wisely. “Massa so clever, you see, Massa Rinaldi. He see all wrong here in this worl’. If massa had made the worl’, now, we wouldn’t ‘ave been bothered with the wimmin. There wouldn’t ha’ been no dress, no dancin’ about and jealousy, no religion, no nothing silly o’ that sort.”</p>

<p>“But the little children, Peter?”</p>

<p>“Ah, massa make ‘em grown up, mans and wimmin, all at once—no, mans, I mean. No wimmin. Ah,” said Peter thoughtfully, poising his crumb-tray on his uplifted hand, “massa so clever that when he goes to heaven he see something dare not right, depen’ upon it, and he tell God Almighty how ‘im must be done.”</p>

<p>Upon which Peter retired, and Rinaldi grew thoughtful. A son! Mr. Lester wanted a son—would he not find a son in his daughter’s husband?</p>

<p>He heard voices in the hall. Mr. Lester was lifting his greatcoat from the stand. The Italian hastened to assist him. Eve, wrapped in a white shawl, went out, followed by Peter, and took her place in the Marlowes’ little single brougham, which had been sent to fetch them. Mr. Lester went after, accompanied by Rinaldi. The sky was sprinkled with stars. The air was clear and chill after the rain.</p>

<p>“What is the use of this wretched little thing?” Mr. Lester gazed disgustedly at the miniature brougham. Rinaldi at once arranged matters by mounting the box; then they drove off through the village, which was generally lighted by the lamp-lit shop-fronts. To-night, however, all was dark. The carriage-lamps flashed upon closed shutters and blank windows. The small shopkeepers were already in their two-shilling seats at the schoolhouse. Mr. Marlowe had made a special visit to each, soliciting patronage in a semi-jocular, semipastoral way. “We want you as audience, and I in particular want to know you associated with the improvements in God’s House—our mutual House of prayer,” he had proposed.</p>

<p>Then the one appealed to, half-gratified at being asked to patronize the church and the Rector, half-sheep-faced—would murmur something unintelligible, wipe his hands on his apron, gingerly take the tickets, hand the Rector the required sum, and watch him walk off with a half-amused misgiving as to whether the affair were altogether correct. “The missus would know.” In most cases the “missuses” were gratified at being deemed worthy to take their places among ” the quality.”</p>

<p>And they mustered in their best Sundayclothes at the hour printed on the tickets—half-past seven. As there was but one entrance (the second door now hidden by a curtain behind the platform led to the infant school), Mrs. Marlowe arranged that they must be in their places at the back before the real audience arrived at eight o’clock.</p>

<p>As Eve, her father, and the Italian, walked through the little crowd of rustics assembled on the wet gravel of the schoolhouse yard, the windows shone brightly; but even Eve and Rinaldi had hardly anticipated the effect their afternoon’s work would produce by candlelight.</p>

<p>As they entered by the side-door, Mrs. Marlowe, in black satin, was standing on the crimson carpeting talking to the De Smythe party, who occupied the front seats in the transformed schoolroom. The whitewashed walls were hung with festoons of ivy and evergreen from the Rectory shrubberies which the girls had been busy making for the past ten days. Mrs. Marlowe had looked up some old ormolu wall-lights. These were placed at intervals along the walls. The floor was carpeted with red baize, and the rows of new cane chairs had been hired from Upchurch. The gay colours worn by the village-folk—who were packed close behind a crimson cord that divided the two-shilling benches from the five-shilling chairs—brightened the end of the room opposite the platform. Here the tiers of gaily -flowering plants, intermixed with choice ferns and shrubs—the music-desks to the left, the piano to the right, and a big white bust of Beethoven in the centre—had a background of crimson curtains, artistically draped by Rinaldi.</p>

<p>Carriages were driving up. May Nevil, wrapped in a swansdown cloak, came fluttering in, and went across the platform,—followed by Ernest Rawson carrying his violin, and by Captain Rawson, who carried a huge roll of music. Mr. Nevil, the honourable and reverend, made a stately entry; Mrs. Nevil, with a glittering diamond spray fastened upon her rich lace cap, looking graciously around, conscious that she was the mother of the heroine of the evening. “Those are your people, Mary—very nice, very respectable, I am sure,” she said, inspecting the crowd on the back benches through her lorgnette—(to her “those good folks who were to be humanized by hearing May sing.” ) Then she accepted a programme from Mr. Marlowe—who flitted about spasmodically, a set and uneasy smile on his face—and subsided into her chair between her daughter Ella and her husband with satisfied dignity.</p>

<p>Here came the officers, dandies most of them, standing aside as two neighbouring clergymen came in—one of these with a somewhat dowdy wife, who had made the most of her Sunday gown by adding lace collar and bows and little trinkets. And when these had all found their seats, while the rising hum of voices grew louder, there was a bustle to the door on the part of the Rector, whose face suddenly fell. Some people came in he had not expected. He had not mentioned the concert to those two married ladies who were possessed of contralto voices, because, after he had “entangled himself with that Miss Morini,” as Mrs. Marlowe called it, he found he could not ask them to sing. But here they were—the lean little Mrs. Farlow-Ferriar, whose scraggy figure was always decked in a wilderness of tiny trimmings and flouncings, and who managed to hang an extraordinary number of chains and bracelets on her bony neck and on the arm now resting within her husband’s (a fine dark man, who passed Mr. Marlowe with a surly nod); and the tall, plump wife of the German banker, Mr. von Hahn, who was gazing fiercely round through his spectacles, his whole appearance, with his long fair beard and thick hair somewhat dishevelled, betokening a sense of injury. Mrs. von Hahn had not been asked to sing! His Laura not asked to sing! He stood looking indignantly about, as the majestic, dark-haired Laura, who had a fat, complacent face, and whose huge shoulders seemed bursting irrepressibly from out her black velvet gown, seated herself next to the emphatic little Mrs. Farlow-Ferriar (whose accentuated manner had more than once led to her being called “F.-F.” — fortissimo — by certain young lady friends with contralto voices who had not been asked to sing when she was present).</p>

<p>The Rector saw the bobbing fair head and the steady black one bent over his programme ; but he had no time to feel misgiving. Here was David Ross, leading in the old man who was blind, who advanced timidly, his head hanging, his hands clutching his young protector’s arm. Eve, peeping from behind the curtain that shut away the infant school (which was temporarily the artists’ room), noticed how kindly and gently Ross seated the old man next to Mr. Lester, and hurried back to fetch in the red-haired, blind painter. Conversation ceased in the room—all eyes were turned towards the door, as two tall men in the Grasslands mulberry livery carried in an invalid chair containing the paralyzed mathematician.</p>

<p>Loud whispers of “Mr. Grant,” “I tell you it ain’t,” “I say it is,” came from the villagers at the back. Mr. Marlowe glanced at his watch. Two minutes past eight! Miss Morini had not arrived; but they must begin. He scurried across the platform. There was a subdued excitement in the little infant schoolroom, where the desks and forms were piled away in the corner, and young people in full evening dress were hovering about against the background of a long white refreshment-table, presided over with much unctuous gravity by the schoolmistress in her best flowery Sunday bonnet. Pretty May Nevil, in her white silk dress, stood in a careless attitude, feeling herself a prima donna, and glancing through her music, humming now and then like a sleepy bird. Ernest Rawson was uneasily busy with his fiddle ; he had been screwing at it and tuning ever since he arrived. Captain Rawson leant against the wall gloomily staring at nothing. He had “poohpoohed” the trifles he had to sing—” The Monks of Old” and ” The Standard-bearer,”—as concessions to popular taste utterly beneath his capacities. All the same, he was in the savagely moody state which he considered to be a noble dislike of display—but a propos of which an irreverent younger brother, still at Eton, had said, “I say, you know, whenever Regy is going to spout he is in a blue funk.”</p>

<p>The Rector stepped airily in like a dancing-master, humming “Hark, the happy Drummer Boy,” and going across to a little knot of serious men in black clothes—the “Upchurch Vocal Union,” who had slunk in and amassed themselves in a corner an hour ago. These six solemn men, of all ages and sizes, were specimens of the <i>bourgeoisie</i> of Upchurch, selected by their leader—a Mr. Lionel Wildsmith, who had failed to win his spurs in the metropolis and had thought it better to be a number one in the provinces than to bark at the heels of the successful in London. Mr. Lionel Wildsmith, already grown grey in Upchurch service, looked gravely at his watch as the Rector came up, gave a glance towards his men, that meant, “Up, sirs, and at it,” and was off upon the platform.</p>

<p>David Ross could number the places of amusement he had been to during his life upon his fingers. This decorated schoolroom, full of well-dressed women, of men with an air of satisfied self-possession, roused a dormant exhilaration. His pulses quickened, his spirits rose. He was sitting next Mr. Lester, whose statement that Eve was in the artist’s room scarcely damped his cheerfulness. He was assisting in pleasure-going to these poor fellows, these crippled friends of Mr. Grant’s. He was in good humour with the world. He felt a warm confidence in Eve—Eve (he never forgot that there was an Eve Lester). Just as the grave members of the “Upchurch Vocal Union” filed upon the platform he was thinking of to-morrow—of Eve Lester’s birthday festival—with a curious thrill of excitement. Elation and the perception of the ridiculous went hand-in-hand. The line of solemn men gazing blankly at the audience while their leader sedately struck the opening chords of their song upon the piano, seemed to him utterly absurd.</p>

<p>“Are they not like undertakers new to the business who don’t know what they have to do with the corpse?” he whispered to Mr. Lester.</p>

<p>“Drrum—drrum—drrum.”</p>

<p>In measured tones the men declaimed their imitation of a drum, then the alto in the corner threw his head on one side and sung out the theme.</p>
<!--Following three lines are in a slightly smaller size than the surrounding text. The last line of this verse is indented in the original. -->
<div><p>“He has no child, no wife,<br>
His duty is his life,<br>
The happy drummer.boy.”<br></p></div>

<p>“Bo-oy, bo-oy—bo-oy,” earnestly sang the chorus.</p>
<!-- Following three lines are in a slightly smaller size than the surrounding text. The third line is indented -->
<div><p>“He’s foremost in the strife,<br>
His duty is his life,<br> 
The happy drummer.boy,”<br></p></div>
<p>rapturously shouted the alto to the accompaniment of the measured “dr-rum—dr-rum —drrum.”</p>

<p>“I consider this an extremely strange song,” whispered Mrs. Farlow-Ferriar to the dignified Laura, pursing up her lips. “Peculiar. A boy who has no wife, no child. What does it mean? There is an ill-concealed impropriety. What do you think, dear Mrs. von Hahn?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said the big contralto, who was given to acceding monosyllables.</p>

<p>“I wonder at Mr. Marlowe,” continued the slighted Mrs. Farlow-Ferriar, folding her programme. “But it is only what I expected.”</p>


<p>The mute-like vocal Unionites bowed and retired amid faint suggestions of approval, and a crisp fluttering of programmes betokened the interest of the audience anent the next item in the musical <i>ménu</i>. This was “The Monks of Old,” to be sung by Captain Rawson.</p>
  
<p>“You will like that, my dear,” said Mrs. de Smythe to her red-faced Squire, who was not in the best of tempers—having had to hurry through his last three glasses of after-dinner port, so as to be in time to escort his important wife and long-nosed daughter. “I heard that song somewhere. It has a great many ho-ho’s and ha-ha’s in it.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse,” growled the Squire sulkily, opening his dazed eyes with the contracted pupils. “I call this an exhibition of idiocy. Idiocy. Just as if I didn’t know what music was. Haven’t I heard the opera-singers?”</p>

<p>A faint clapping, and a laugh from the back benches. Captain Rawson strode upon the platform, stumbled over an inequality in the crimson-covered boards, recovered himself, then turned pale, and glared fiercely at the audience. He was not angry—except with the carpenter, whom he was inwardly anathematizing. Etta Watts had tripped lightly after him and was playing the prelude, her eyes raised to the schoolroom ceiling in the ecstasy of promotion to be somewhat—ever so insignificant a somewhat—to her military idol.</p>

<p>Then, with a frown, the Captain sang out his tale of the monks of old; relating their jollity, how</p>
<!-- Following two lines are a slightly smaller size than surrounding text, and they are indented -->
<div><p>“They laughed, ha, ha!<br>
 And they coughed, ho, ho,”<br></p></div> 

<p>with the grim sternness of a vocal executioner. Such monks—the audience felt— should never have existed; and if fate ordained that exist they must, the power of living in beings whose laughs and coughs sounded thus should be speedily annihilated by the brave Captain and his troop. To be blown from the cannon’s mouth would be a doom not altogether undeserved by reverend gentlemen who could cough and laugh like that. Captain Rawson, his hideous but graphic warning ended, retired from the platform amid silent awe. The rustics at the back had stared open-mouthed and openeyed, for Captain Rawson was an imitator of some of the greatest Italian vocalists, and appeared to consider that “the words (of a song were nothing.”</p>

<p>“I tell yer it’s a ghost story, with ghosts howling and owls squealing from the church tower at midnight,” was the opinion of the grocer’s wife, who had been educated at a “Seminary for Young Ladies” at Upchurch, and had spent her pocket-money in light literature adapted to the taste and purse of the feminine young.</p>

<p>“‘Tain’t—’tis a comic song. Heard Josh Smith, one of them Vocal Unionites, sing it t’other night, Mrs. Dunn.”</p>

<p>There was quite a controversy among the back-benchers after Captain Rawson had disappeared, and a lull ensued. An awkward lull. Loud whisperings issued like snake-hissing from behind the crimson curtain so artistically draped by Rinaldi. There was commotion in the sacred precincts of the “artist’s room.” The third number in the programme stood against the name of “Miss Morini.” But no Miss Morini was there.</p>

<p>“Just like her—didn’t even get the titles of her songs in time for going to press.” The Reverend Josiah had ruffled his sleek little hair-fringe, and was going about the artist’s room as one seeking to devour.</p>

<p>“I play if you like.” The tall Rinaldi was in a pleased humour in an atmosphere of success and pretty women. May was very pretty, he considered, especially when she pursed up those rosy lips; and his divinity, Eve, illumined the little infant school as a sun.</p>

<p>“Thanks, no, no.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind singing my song first,” said smiling May, not at all displeased that her criticiser had returned among them unapplauded. (For the brothers of adoring men have a way of criticising the adored, and Ernest Rawson was her adorer.)</p>

<p>“What!” said the disgusted Rector; “my ‘Little Rose has bloomed for me ‘ to burst upon an unprepared audience? Thank you, May; it is impossible!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile a vision had flashed upon the audience. After the school-door had creaked, opened, and some excitement had ruffled the schoolmaster and one or two other men who were the stewards of the evening—a tall man appeared, a lady on his arm; a lady who seemed Eastern, wrapped from head to foot in some gleaming silvery stuff, between the folds of which flashed the whitest skin, the blackest eyes.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” piously ejaculated the Rector.</p>

<p>The red curtain was lifted, the veiled figure tripped down the steps, followed by Colonel. Farrar; then something silvery showered about and disappeared, the veil dropped and disclosed a splendidly-developed woman, a dark beauty with a creamy skin and great dark eyes, black hair plaited with pearls bound around a well-shaped head— a gorgeous dress of mingled silk and satin, white as the lace and pearls with which it was lavishly adorned, folding a fine figure so closely as to exhibit rather than to hide its curves.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marlowe’s experienced gaze saw the extreme of a suspected fashion in the style, in the jewelled shoe and the paucity of neck drapery. “Josiah has been taken in, as usual,” was her inward comment. She cast about to make the best of the situation. Colonel Farrar ought never to have introduced this questionably-fashionable damsel. But for him Nemesis must suspend her action. Mrs. Marlowe had enough to deal with here now, at once.</p>

<p>All eyes in the artist’s room were fixed upon the undeniably beautiful woman. Mrs. Marlowe went up and said, “Miss Morini, I believe?” in a chill but perfectly amicable way which would have been the envy of a societary, had a true societary been present.</p>

<p>The beautiful being bowed and smiled, showing a row of perfect teeth. Then she held out her hand towards Colonel Farrar, with a piteous <i>moue</i>—something was wrong with her glove.</p>

<p>To do the Rev. Josiah justice, he was horrified. His wife—May—Eve—this lady —the quartette seemed squirming round and round him till he was giddy with the thought. He looked about him stupidly; something in his manner appeased his wife.</p>

<p>“We must do the best we can, my dear. Colonel Farrar ought to have explained. Still, it cannot be helped.”</p>

<p>Mr. Marlowe thoroughly understood his wife’s vague words. He gave her a grateful look, then went up to the officer and the young lady.</p>

<p>“You omitted to send me the names of your songs, so I was unable to have them printed,” he said.</p>

<p>“Ah! I had not quite decided what I would sing. Finally, I chose ‘Robert, toi que j’aime,’ and the aria from the <i>Puritani</i>.”</p>

<p>Miss Morini fixed her great eyes patronisingly on the little clergyman, evidently posing as the goddess of the occasion.</p>

<p>“But—but—those are soprano songs,” Mr. Marlowe stammered in his dismay. “Of course, I thought you were contralto.”</p>

<p>Miss Morini glanced at Colonel Farrar with half-pitying amusement. Colonel Farrar bristled with importance and annoyance. “Contralto? How could Mr. Marlowe have supposed such a thing? Everyone with any knowledge whatever of musical matters knew of Miss Morini, whose voice surpassed that of Grisi in compass, purity, volume,” etc., etc. Mr. Marlowe felt as if he shrank and collapsed. May! he could not look round at her.</p>

<p>“Of course, of course; naturally—I did not mean “he miserably stammered.</p>

<p>His songs were done for—utterly, cruelly extinguished. “A little Rose has bloomed for me,” immediately after ” Roberto!”</p>

<p>Here the villagers at the back, their awe subsided, began to stamp their feet and knock their sticks upon the bare flooring. “It would not do to keep the stage waiting any longer,” said Mr. Marlowe with feeble jocularity. Miss Morini produced her songs. Who was to accompany? What! no professional accompanist? She shrugged her shoulders, and ostentatiously repressed a smile. Perhaps Mr. Marlowe would oblige? Or there would naturally be the organist.</p>

<p>“Something must be done, Mr. Marlowe.” The Colonel became energetic. He was a tall, middle-aged man, with fierce mustachios. When he began to twist these, his soldiers were on the look-out. “Here, you there, can’t you play this young lady’s accompaniment?”</p>

<p>The Colonel was summoning the chief of the Upchurch Vocal Union! The pompous Mr. Lionel Wildsmith might be said to be himself a colonel—colonel of the middleclass musical Upchurchers. He knew his position, and his demeanour was condescending and patient. His “men” were wont to cluster, as it were, in his shadow, still holding themselves aloof. As the Colonel spoke, the alto visibly shuddered; and one of the tenors, a grocer’s assistant, declared afterwards that he heard his hair bristle, and you might have knocked him down with a feather.</p>

<p>“Sir!” This was all the great man replied; but that “Sir!” was as pregnant with expostulation, explanation, consciousness that this manner of address was an unfortunate mistake, etc., etc., as ever was that renowned Burleigh-nod, with all the wonderful meanings ascribed to it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marlowe saw the military error (indeed, to the Colonel, the Director of the Upchurch Vocal Union was merely a lowclass civilian), and, as it were, interposed graciously. “Mr. Wildsmith, who had really been too kind, too obliging, as it was—must really not be called upon to do any more. They were already overwhelmed with the obligation;” and while she was speaking and smiling, Mrs. Marlowe was taking mental stock. That group in the corner — May, gracefully conscious, coquetting with three men at once (Captain Rawson, Ernest, Rinaldi); while Etta Watts was doing chorus as usual, and Eve was standing apart watching, with a wondering, wistful expression in her large child-eyes—it would be well to disperse that group. Mrs. Marlowe scattered them with a <i>coup</i>.</p>

<p>“Eve.” Then in a few words she told Eve—difficult accompaniment—only Rinaldi could be relied upon at the moment’s notice. She did not like to ask him; would Eve do so?</p>

<p>The girl, who had been feeling dispirited, puzzled, out of place, with “nothing to do,” brightened up, and touching the Italian’s arm, asked the little favour—asked it simply. She had been wondering why he was talking to May so exclusively, but without any sense of neglect. And he turned his black eyes rapturously upon her, seeing jealousy, preference even to open display in this interruption, and after giving her an ardent look with a passionately uttered “Anything that <i>you</i> ask,” went up to Miss Morini, saw another beautiful woman, and readily and amiably adapted himself to his whilom <i>róle</i>, led her to the platform, carrying the music, then threw his energies into the accompanying — a gift naturally belonging to his subtly-sympathetic temperament.</p>

<p>A little rustle of astonishment went about the audience as the handsome woman in the glory of shilling white sailed towards them, and stood among the flowers, against the crimson—making a gorgeous picture. Mr. Lester looked on coldly and curiously. Ross saw a suggestion of Cleopatra; the women looked and whispered, critically to each other, with peremptory disapproval to their male relatives ; but all except the two blind men recognised the beauty that satisfies the eyes and the craving mental sense.</p>

<p>Rinaldi’s clear crisp touch was pleasant to the ears, while the audience stared with fascinated eyes. Miss Morini was a skilled platformite. She had clambered into society, as it were, over the amateur platform—as a burlesque divinity comes up through a stage trap. She stood with her chiselled, delicately-rouged and powdered face placidly adjusted, her eyes lowered and fixed upon her music with thoughtful modesty. As she launched her first note, those grand eyes rolled up and a sublime expression shone upon her face. This was a supreme trick upon which she had been frequently congratulated by old acquaintances who had known her when she was working about the house in a dirty print frock, her hair fuzzy with fluff and feathers, dutifully helping her lodginghouse-keeper mother. “Lor, Clara, Old Gooseberry must ‘ave taught yer,” was, politely expressed, the opinion of former friends who had seen the untidy little girl blossom into the magnificent Miss Morini. Yet if they had seen the kernel within the nut, they would have known that the glamour was to her a flash of limelight, the patronage and applause a mere firework rocket, and that beneath the web of tricks beat a tired heart; that even to-day, when escorted for a “country walk” by her patron-admirer Colonel Farrar, the still autumn sunset which gilded the reddened foliage, shining through the wet like tearful eyes brightening into a smile, had touched her to the quick, had made the Colonel’s “haw-hawing” society prattle a torture— had wrung her unsatisfied and disappointed nature till to sing to-night was a relief.</p>

<p>“Toi que j’aime!” Who the “toi” might be the transplanted girl knew not. As her splendid voice swooped into the air tinged with an anguish that tempered its sweetness and “bit” even the uneducated ear, she only knew that within her was some sensitive spirit that cried “Give, give,” and turned away in horror from whatever her life did give; that this hungering instinct grew stronger and wilder, and that, were it not for the outlet when she sang, and for the opiates of kindnesses despairingly given to others, it would seize, overpower and drive the rest of her being over the precipice into the unknown blackness. This it was that made her song a living voice. As she poured out the passionate phrases the most resisting of her auditors gave way, and listening, felt some responding vibration within themselves; knew—though how they knew they could not have told—that this was less a song than a soul-cry. Then, when the singer stilled, they broke forth into applause that had an inarticulate voice like the tears of the suffering, an applause which concerned each auditor’s self—self having been implicated in the performance, though how, they neither knew nor guessed.</p>

<p>The song over, this frantic burst of applause sounded like some cannon-shot in the ears of the rightful performers. The rightful performers were naturally Miss Nevil, Captain and Mr. Rawson. The flushed beauty descending triumphantly amid clamours of approval was to them as a fox slinking out of his poultry-yard to a farmer. The farmer’s wrath naturally would turn towards any neglectful <i>employé</i>. The wrath of Mr. Marlowe’s three principal allies naturally turned towards Mr. Marlowe, the instigator of this unparalleled piece of—they did not know exactly what to call it. Misplaced and ignorant zeal would be too mild a term, they felt, as “hoorors” and “ancors” sounded vulgarly and offensively upon their ears.</p>

<p>Some fair faces are demonisible by an evil expression. Such an one was May Nevil’s. The Rector was so occupied by his pleasure at this success, that, smiling and beating time during Miss Morini’s song, he never even glanced towards the charming May. And he applauded as loudly as anyone, feeling that Miss Morini had been introduced into Alveston by his agency, and that Alveston ought consequently to be deeply indebted to him.</p>

<p>So he joined Colonel Farrar in applauding as Rinaldi reverentially conducted the successful artist from the platform—then, as Miss Morini returned to acknowledge the tiny hailstorm of approval, he went about the room quite triumphant,—”cock-a-whoop,” as the disgusted Captain Rawson murmured under his breath.</p>

<p>“And after this you expect me to go on and sing your ‘Little Rose has bloomed for me.’ Not I, Mr. Marlowe.” (The pretty May, with all her bright blossoming ways5 could prove the toughness of her branch on occasion.) “Not I.” And her little foot was set firmly upon the floor, and her tiny white teeth were clenched as she settled into a becoming attitude amid the gloom of the semi-insulted “Vocal Union,” who seemed drawn up in array as her background—so many black pawns flanking a white queen.</p>

<p>“Not—<i>what?</i>” Again something corkscrewy seemed to disport within the Rector’s brain.</p>

<p>“Well, of course, Mr. Marlowe, you can scarcely expect Miss Nevil to go on after you have played her such a shabby trick,” said the Captain.</p>

<p>“Shabby trick?” The Rector was terrified. He stammered. “My dear friend, really, when a man is worried like I am, it is rather hard when his friends are down upon him.”</p>

<p>May tossed her head, and threw aside her music. But she intended to sing (she thought, “she was not going to be done out of singing by anybody”), so presently she picked up the copy of “the Little Rose,” and went with sufficient placidity upon the platform, strengthened by the knowledge that the Rev. Josiah was, as she called it, “frightened out of his wits.” She was not an ill-natured girl, but she felt pleased to think, if Mr. Marlowe could have seen Mrs. Nevil indignantly fanning herself, and her honourable and reverend husband looking snakes and daggers after what they called “such an unseemly exhibition on the part of a low professional,” he would have collapsed then and there.</p>

<p>There was a murmur as May walked on, her self-contained manner a mute criticism upon her predecessor. She was Miss Nevil of Upchurch, and as such had a claim upon the intelligent sympathies of the audience. This they felt, and settled into a hushed expectation. But the atmosphere was one of reaction. Something passionate and real had passed and gone. When May came to the front and cleared her throat with a “h’m-h’m”—as she glanced back at Mr. Marlowe signalling that he might begin—it was as some common white butterfly fluttering in after the sudden and unexpected advent of a magnificent tropical moth.</p>

<p>“Poor Mr. Marlowe, he evidently knows nothing of programme-making,” said Mrs. Farlow-Ferriar, resignedly composing herself to listen.</p>

<p>“No,” ejaculated Laura, the contralto, rearing her black head.</p>

<p>The contralti were so far consoled in that they were not supplanted. There were no contralto songs. They were half-disarmed by this display of soprano—merely enough wrathful sense of injury being left to desire the punishment of Mr. Marlowe. Had contralti appeared, the consequences might have been really serious; for an alliance of two female tongues might, under favourable circumstances, scourge their little world—how much more sting one modest and musical High Church clergyman!</p>

<p>“A little Rose has bloomed for me,” sang May Nevil in her slightly throaty and sharply-inclined voice.</p>
<!-- The following five lines are indented and centered, and written in a slightly smaller size than the surrouning text -->
<div><p>“A little Rose,<br>
Does she demand a spouse?<br>
Oh, no, no, no!<br>
A little Rose has bloomed for me,<br>
A little Rose.”<br></p></div>

<p>The Rector nodded and played his disjointed chords with exceeding caution, but the audience so far cared as little for his verse (the words were by the composer himself) as for his music. He went on playing his chords and nodding while May hemmed and turned over a page amid a depressing silence.</p>

<p>“A little Rose has bloomed for me” (began May again in shrilly accents).</p>
  <!-- The following five lines are indented and centered, and written in a slightly smaller size than the surrouning text -->
<div><p>“A little Rose,<br>
I love her sweet fair petals!<br>
Yes, yes, yes!<br>
A little Rose has bloomed for me,<br>
A little Rose.”<br></p></div>

<p>The song might have been pathetic—sung, perhaps, to an after-dinner assemblage in the drawing-room of one who prided himself justly on his wine and liqueur connoisseurship. Here, after “Roberto,” “A little Rose” fell, faded, scattering withered and scentless leaves as it passed.</p>

<p>The blind men inquired about the song and the singer disappointedly. “I suppose it is pretty good?” asked David Ross of Mr. Lester, receiving a dry “Remarkably good for him, I should imagine.” Then, as May sang a spiritless third verse and retired amid an evident effort on the part of the audience to express their satisfaction, Ross and his neighbour began to talk. And their talk was of the other evening, when Ross was admitted to the Brotherhood at the same time as Mr. Wellbourne and his brother. Mr. Lester always displayed a certain eagerness when the subject of the great firm of which he was a member was introduced; but to-night he spoke with a feverish restlessness which Ross noted and inwardly commented upon.</p>

  <p>The Vocal Union came next, marching solemnly upon the platform, depressed, almost awed by the encounter between the Colonel (who was now strutting about, delightedly receiving the admiring gratulations anent his <i>protegée</i> that he felt to be his due) and their chief—whose rigid face meant war to the knife. It was a lugubrious chant rather than a glee, the title being “Alas, the Dying Maid.” A martial phrase, played with lugubrious, expostulating meaning by the insulted chief, prefaced the principal melody, wailed almost hysterically by the alto.</p>
 <!-- The following five lines are indented and centered, and written in a slightly smaller size than the surrouning text. The last line is indented further than the rest -->
<div><p>“Alas, the dying maid,<br>
 Her last words have been said;<br>
 The debt must now be paid;<br>
 Her corse in earth be laid,<br>
While all around do weep> weep, weep.”</p></div>
  
<p>How very much like the ‘cheep’ of my poor old Piper, the Cochin-China with the broken leg,” said Mrs. Smythe loudly in her partner’s ear—for the Squire dozed, and a coming snore was casting its prefatory snort in advance.</p>

<p>“Nothing to Evans’, my dear. All bosh! You don’t bring me here again, I can tell you,” he sleepily murmured.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smythe settled her shawl. The comatose Squire was not in a rage, which was a boon to be thankful for. The choir suddenly shouted out a vociferatory chorus. The dying maid had her champions. The Vocal Union seemed horrified at the idea that her last words had been said (as indeed those last words should be where no voice more adaptable to the expression of the final wishes of an expiring damsel than a raspy alto was procurable). Amid the din David Ross and Mr. Lester went on talking.</p>

<p>“Do you know that I was really taken aback when I saw Mr. Wellbourne,” David Ross was saying (he was leaning his head against the wall, and quietly smiling to himself). “Stout, florid, all that sort of thing. Not in the least the Mephistopheles or Machiavelli I expected.”</p>

<p>“My good sir, what can you mean? Mephistopheles — Machiavelli! Applying such names to Wellbourne—cheery-hearted, open-handed as the day!”</p>

<p>“Even daylight deceives on occasion, Mr. Lester.”</p>

<p>“Well, you were the last person I should have imagined influenceable by captious reports.”</p>

<p>“Then you have heard the reports?” Ross, suddenly serious, faced Mr. Lester.</p>

<p>“It depends upon what reports you mean.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lester seemed to writhe as he uneasily turned away. (The Vocal Union were filing down from the platform; his eyes were attracted by the last dark head quivering against the crimson background.)</p>

<p>“I suppose (I know I may speak truthfully without offence) that you know the rumours?”</p>

<p>“Speak out, my friend—I am the last man to care.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lester looked tired and wan; yet Ross admired the set expression on the wasted face that boldly confronted him. Something in the proud, bold gesture reminded him of Eve. A slight shiver shook him, as a passing breeze an aspen.</p>

<p>“The rumours are not exactly pleasant rumours, Mr. Lester—I must confess that much. Still, the devil, as father of lies, may claim to be grandfather of the demi-lie report. What is the matter?”</p>

<p>Ross jumped up, alarmed. Mr. Lester had abruptly risen, and was going towards the door.</p>

<p>He would have gone to his assistance, but Rinaldi, who had been watching from behind the curtain, rushed out—his arm was under Mr. Lester’s before Ross had left his seat.</p>

<p>The two men—Rinaldi supporting his chief—passed out. The door closed behind them. They were in the schoolhouse porch, in the cool night—in the moonlight flood that made the sage’s thin face look wan and ghastly. The noisy murmur of music and applause rattled within, behind the closed door</p>.

<p>As Mr. Lester’s spare body tumbled lifelessly into the muscular arms of the Italian, outside sounds and sights struck Rinaldi almost painfully. The dark patches with glowing eyes were waiting carriages in the shadowy lane. The faint clatter and snorts were tossing horses’ heads. A great compassion rose up within him. The holding of this burden brought back the recollection of an awful minute, when he had clasped a dying mother in his arms.</p>

<p>“Help!” he called out, and one of the menservants attending the carriages came hurrying up. There must be water near at hand. The servant, one of Ross’s (or rather of Mr. Grant’s), seemed equal to the occasion; in a few moments Rinaldi’s handkerchief lay cool and wet upon Mr. Lester’s forehead.</p>

<p>A shuddering sigh, then a struggling murmur.</p>

<p>“Eve—Eve!”</p>

<p>“She shall come!” said Rinaldi, and placing the fainting man in the footman’s arms, he hurried into the schoolroom.</p>

<p>Ernest Rawson stood upon the platform, assiduously tuning his violin to the pianoforte suggestions of Etta Watts. Rinaldi passed hurriedly across the platform. Mr. Marlowe, May Nevil, and Captain Rawson were discussing in angry whispers; Eve stood by with her back to him. “Your father wants you.” He took her hand and led her out. Mr. Lester stood leaning against the porch. He had rallied, but the pallor of his face, that curious strained smile—Eve’s heart sank.</p>

<p>“We will take him home.” Rinaldi rushed off and found the Rectory brougham. Then the two assisted him in. Rinaldi made light of the faintness, and talked his foreign chatter as they drove back to the Hall, but Eve was silent. Even Peter’s cheerful stolidity as he helped his master up the steps—his “Ah, missy, Massa Lester all right directly him drink good wine!” as he bustled about—failed to dispel the chill of a growing misgiving. She sat watching the stately figure of her father. He had sunk into a wide easy-chair in the dimly-lit drawing-room. His face was sharp and white against the green velvet. It seemed shrunk and suddenly aged; his hand drooped over the arm. Hands are expressive; in this hand there was a painful suggestion of skeleton thinness, of life dropping from worn, relaxed fingers. And, sharpest pang of all—his beloved eyes did not wander in search of hers, as the eyes of the loved weak seek the eyes of the loved strong in the hour when life is laid low. Mr. Lester’s eyes were withdrawn and fixed upon vacancy. Eve, in her grief and compassion, in her longing to devote her whole being, as it were, as a filial holocaust—felt, as she looked, that she was thrust out, that her father was, as it were, isolating her by some impassable cordon of thought.</p>

<p>Rinaldi and Peter talked. The sage had conclusively negatived the suggestion of a doctor by a deprecatory wave of the thin hand. Presently he fixed his eyes upon Peter, and said slowly, with effort, that he would go to bed; upon which Eve sprang forward, to be repulsed by a gesture. Mr. Lester summoned Peter, and after nodding round in a cold, vague way, he disappeared, leaning upon the strong old shoulder of his black servant.</p>

<p>Rinaldi had seen and admired Eve’s filial anguish. He stood, holding himself aloof with silent respect, watching her beautiful troubled face. What should he say?</p>

<p>“Ah, mademoiselle, but you must not figure to yourself that Monsieur Lester vare ill. Believe me, it nothing. Noth—ing at all” (with a gesture of assurance).</p>

<p>Eve shook her head with a sad smile.</p>

<p>“And he will be alone—all night,” she said, half to herself. “He will not have me with him; and Peter sleeps—you cannot wake him.”</p>

<p>She had not intended a hint, but Rinaldi saw an advantage at once.</p>

  <p>Alone all night! Mr. Lester, while he, Rinaldi, was in the house? Nothing of the sort. It should not be. He enjoyed sitting up. His room was next to his host’s. He would have his door open and listen; and ah! he could move without noise like one little serpent. He would in and out and see how Mr. Lester get on, and no one hear him—no, not even mademoiselle herself, <i>inquiète</i> though she might be.</p>

<p>And Eve gratefully accepted. There was a certain delicacy of feeling in Rinaldi’s manner that touched her. Her eyes moistened; she stretched out her hand.</p>

<p>His dark face flushed. She had forgotten the evening at the Rectory, but he remembered when he had kissed her hand and she had wept thereat, only too well. He looked at the fair hand, snowy in the soft lamplight, with a passion of longing and regret—one of those readily leaping waves of emotion of his reflected in his dark eyes.</p>

<p>He moved a step back.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle not like me to touch her hand,” he said reproachfully. Then the fiery black eyes happened to meet the troubled blue orbs, and the scene in the garden suddenly returned to Eve’s mind. In one flash she saw David Boss, bareheaded, telling her his life-story in the twilight. She refelt her almost painful sympathy. Then the quick revulsion—when Rinaldi burst into the atmosphere of quiet human grief as some reckless wild animal might rush into a bed of delicate flowers, withering her with that burning kiss upon her hand as carelessly as the rough paw would have crushed the frail blooms.</p>


<p>She remembered. But she forgave, and softened towards this man who seemed devoted to her loved father—all during that short moment when their eyes met. Then she dropped her eyelids, the corners of her mouth relaxed into an expression of resignation.</p>

<p>“If you wish to kiss my hand, I suppose you must,” she said, with a sigh—such a sigh as a mother’s who perforce gives way at last to some wearying demand of her troublesome child.</p>

<p>But Rinaldi, who felt, to a certain extent, master of the situation, and believed himself the Pygmalion of this Galatea, repressed his sudden passion.—This was not the moment to pluck a coveted fruit evidently not yet fully ripe.</p>

<p>“I do not kiss the hands of my statues, mademoiselle, however they may be of the most beautiful,” he said, with a grave bow.</p>

<p>He thought he could afford to wait.</p>

<p>They had both been too preoccupied to attend to a noise of shutting doors, and each started almost guiltily as the drawing-room door opened, and Mr. Marlowe rushed in. His clerical tie was awry, his hair ruffled. His eyes flashed with anger. He stammered out:</p>

<p>“But, upon my word, this is too bad! What is it all about?”</p>

<p>He could hardly proclaim his injuries: how, after Miss Morini’s second song, which was down next after Ernest Rawson’s violin solo, “The Evening Dream”—that great event of the evening—was to have been played ; but how, when the audience could. be prevailed upon to stop applauding Miss Morini, no Rinaldi could be found, May Nevil would not go on, so the Vocal Union were now singing that last song which was to have ended the programme.</p>

<p>“Too bad, too bad.” This was the only expression which came to the Rector’s bidding, as he pulled Rinaldi into the hall. Eve was no more to him at that moment than some Fiji islander with whom he had nothing to do. And as for Mr. Lester, whose sudden illness Rinaldi related with much facial expression and gesticulation as the two drove quickly back to the schoolhouse, Mr. Marlowe could only feel that Mr. Lester had chosen the very worst moment for his attack, whatever it was—and that somehow atheism had something to do with it. A good Churchman would <i>not</i> have been guilty of so <i>mal à propos</i> a fainting-fit.</p>

<p>“Bah! I don’t believe in men fainting,” said the Rector bitterly.</p>

<p>Where a human being is a hybrid, the delicate balance is oftentimes disturbed. A very breath maydo it. Mr. Marlowe was a musician as well as a cleric. To-night the musician was to the fore. Should the cleric be blamed for the natural impetuosities of the musician? Rinaldi troubled himself but little with such philosophical niceties, but summoned all his good-humour, rushed upon the platform, plunged into “The Evening Dream,” and did all he could for it. What was the gloom of the artist’s room (the performers were all at loggerheads) or the whispering restlessness of the audience to him? He was pursuing a scheme, and Mr. Marlowe was merely one of his levers. He shut his ears to the faintly-ironical welcome which greeted his appearance, and drew upon his entire powers to give the fairest possible chance to the Rector’s musical offspring. But after Miss Morini had taken them by storm, the audience cared little for “The Evening Dream.” They were mostly amiably occupied in discussing Mr Marlowe’s mismanagement. “Poor man, some one ought to tell him that he knows about as much of concert-giving as about preaching.” (Mrs. Farlow-Ferriar.) “I hope this will be a lesson to him, and that for the future he will confine himself to his neglected parish work,” was Mr. Nevil’s sternly-spoken opinion. His daughter had been eclipsed by Miss Morini, and the concert was, so far as regarded the programme, a failure. These were unpardonable sins in the eyes of the honourable and reverend gentleman (who had been instrumental in securing the living of Alveston for his old college friend), and his aspect was very grim indeed.</p>

<p>And suddenly, during the performance of “The Evening Dream “—indeed, just at the point where pianissimo runs and trills wound about the theme, like some slenderly-luxuriant vine—the somnolent Squire de Smythe awoke; managed (after much dodging with some enemy who seemed to snatch away his watch when his weary eyes coquetted with the dancing figures on the white face) to ascertain that it was time to go—and accordingly said, “Come along,” in stentorian tones to his belongings, as he staggered to his feet. The audience tittered, and Mrs. de Smythe’s red face grew purple; but the Squire’s word was law to his family, and the party worked their way to the door, fascinating the attention of the auditorium. The remarks were not of the charms of the Rector’s pianoforte piece, or Rinaldi’s interpretation thereof. Little whispers circulated, such as “Who’ll put him to bed, d’ye think?” “He must weigh eighteen stun, if he weighs a pound;” “Bailiff said the old chap couldn’t speak a word mornin’s till he’d swallered half a pint of brandy;” “She deserves all she gets, cantankerous old skinflint.” “The Evening Dream” was destined to fall upon stony ground. A few people clapped for the Rector’s sake. But when May Nevil came forward to sing “Love’s Demand,” there was a general stampede. Few present cared for the Rev. Mr. Nevil, the great clergyman who ruled Upchurch society by force of rank and wealth (which interpreted, means that none among the audience saw their way to “getting anything out of him”), so, emboldened by the eclipse of May by Miss Morini, they simply marched out.</p>

<p>Rinaldi, safely off the platform, rushed back to the Hall. The building looked black and sombre against the clear nightsky, enlivened by but one twinkling light in Mr. Lester’s room. As he stood on the top step waiting to be let in, the wind went moaning through the churchyard trees, the swaying of the fluttering sprays of Virginian creeper above the porch cast flitting, shadowy patterns upon the grim face in its wreath of knotted chains that, as it looked blankly at the Italian with its smoothly-rounded eyes, seemed smiling a derisive smile in the moonlight. To the imaginative artist this sculptured face of Slavery seemed endowed for the moment with some weird borrowed life, lent by a mocking Fate to warn him that beyond that threshold lay his slavery. Slavery! As he stepped back almost hesitating under this unexpected impression, Peter, the emancipated slave, cautiously opened the door, and nodded gravely at him, as if in warning. One short moment of hesitation, and the Italian stepped into the house where lived this newest object of his passion, determined to risk whatever there might be to risk, even if it were a hand-to-hand encounter with Fate herself.</p>

<p>“Massa Lester bad.” This it was that cast the quaint, perplexed expression upon Peter’s old black face. His life was bound up with the life at the Hall; “Massa Lester” and “Missy Eve” were the objects for which he existed. He had watched his master closely of late, and had seen a change in him; had seen the calm self-assurance fade, and an uncertain, questioning irritability take its place. This change in Mr. Lester’s demeanour might be the reason, thought Peter, why his beautiful young mistress had softened, and, as it were, modified. The proud young Amazon, with her careless head held high, no longer stepped with that air of almost reckless freedom—the manner which had astonished David Ross when they first met in the old churchyard. There was a feminine smoothness in her gait, a new softness seemed to round her young figure and her thoughtful face.</p>

<p>The quick negro instincts had not lain idle. Peter, as he rubbed his plate and polished his glass, had indulged in hundreds of minute speculations. He had come to no conclusion respecting the cause of the change in his master. He thought the change in Eve might be produced by anxiety respecting her father. Only tonight, when, on ushering in Mr. Marlowe, he noticed embarrassment in both Rinaldi and Eve, did the idea occur to him that the new member of the Brotherhood, “Massa Rinaldi,” had been the first whose arrow had struck somewhere near the mark he fully believed to be the supreme goal aimed at by all the younger members of the Brotherhood—Eve’s heart. Before Rinaldi had returned he had thought the matter out, shaking his woolly, grey pate considerably as he squatted outside his master’s half-open door. He felt a superstitious reverence for Eve’s bold innocence, the brave purity which could not recognise the evil it did not know. Yet (so he whispered secretly to himself, Brother of Freedom and womanhater though he was), “Wimmin was wimmin.” For a female to be stuck up in creation like some cocoa-nut palm was not the usual thing, and Peter had rather compassionated than envied Eve’s solitary womanhood, and had felt satisfaction when she and Mrs. Marlowe came together. There was something sympathetic with his racial tendencies in the artistic Southerner. And if Rinaldi wished to ally himself with Eve, the African interiorily bid him “God speed.” Not that he was going to show the Italian his feelings. Oh dear, no! Peter knew better than <i>that</i>. Still, there was no harm in being friendly.</p>

<p>Rinaldi was comfortably received, as the old negrocarefully shut and bolted the house-door. Peter was even touched to tears by Rinaldi’s intention to watch Mr. Lester during the night. Eve had gone to bed. Mr. Lester seemed calm and quiet. Peter conducted the Italian to his apartment, and after showing him every attention, retired almost reverentially.</p>

<p>Rinaldi, giving a comical glance round as he recognised his position as night-watcher, stealthily crept about and arranged his room for the vigil. Peter had left claret, spring-water, and biscuits on a side-table to console his inner man till the houseman should bring him hot coffee at sunrise. He had borrowed a pile of French novels from the library. He changed his evening clothes for his rough working-dress, lowered the lamp-shade, and throwing himself into a cane rocking-chair, composed himself to read.</p>

<p>He was in the front of the house. Eve’s‘ bedroom and sitting-room were at the back. She had left the baize door in the corridor open that she might hear sounds in her father’s room. She was not intending to try to sleep. Sleep would be a mockery after such cruel anxiety, such an unexpected rejection of sympathy. How she loved her father! How tenderly she yearned over his evident suffering, which she could not alleviate! She sat in the window-seat of her sitting-room, her hot head leaning against the cool window-frame. The wind played with the silken masses of hair that lay upon her light evening gown. Her large, weary eyes gazed out upon the moonlit landscape. There were the trees shuddering blackly in the night wind; the still fields; beyond, the towers of Grasslands were white above the dark belt of shrubbery. Then to the left the graves crouched among the tombstones, as if hiding in remorseful grief. These were the same, immovable, while she, the living creature, was hunted and tossed by—what? What were these strong feelings under which she shivered or fevered? Why were they? Where did they come from?</p>

<p>She looked passionately up into the quiet sky. The moon shone calmly down. There was a hush; then the church clock tolled one solemn stroke.</p>

<p>“One.”</p>

<p>The answer to her restless thoughts came like a grave compelling hand laid upon her shoulder. She had read with her father how this idea of a One changeless whole had steadied the wildest rebellion of magnificently endowed minds, how it had proved the key to bewildering contradictions. She felt, gazing out upon that mere tiny corner of creation, how little, how insignificant was her being; yet at that moment it seemed the centre of her surroundings, for she was all aflame with mental suffering.</p>

<p>“Sometimes he used to be cold; did not even look at me—or notice me; and I didn’t care,” she thought, referring to her father. “Oh, why, why do I care now?” All of a sudden her head fell upon her breast, and the soft muslin was wetted by her tears.</p>

<p>Nature might soothe her grief, but Nature remained aloof—and silent. At least, outside Nature did. Eve was wiping away her tears when a sudden noise arrested her attention—an unusual sound at the time of night—a footstep crackling on some near gravel-path.</p>

<p>Her tears dried upon her cheeks. Her ears were on the alert. Her heart started into an unwonted life of quick, furious beats. Then she leant out of window. The gardenpaths, scattered as they were with shining pebbles, would soon have shown up an intruding figure. Eve searched with her eyes, closely following the gravelled ways. Then the sharp crackles smote her left ear. The churchyard! She turned her head rapidly and saw something moving, a black shadow against the white headstones. She watched it move slowly along till it came to the gate that divided the churchyard from the big field—that gate she was leaning over when she first met Ross. There it paused. A tiny white patch glimmered; a face was turned towards the Hall. Then she heard a cough, and noticed a spark, a red spark, the burning end of a cigar.</p>

<p>“It is David Ross,” she thought. And with the thought came a sense of comfort. Then he cared sufficiently for her—father— to come out of his way to see if all were right. Her estimate of him, that he was generous-hearted, had not been wrong. To-morrow she would see him, perhaps get the chance of finding out what had made him hold aloof since that evening in the Rectory garden when he gave her his confidence.</p>

<p>Eve watched the figure at the gate. It was stationary for some time. Then she heard the faint sound of the gate opening and shutting, and the black speck travelled slowly across the stubble-field towards Grasslands.</p>

<p>She shut her window gently. All was silent in the house; she lay down on her sofa, intending to watch and listen. Gradually her eyes drooped, her head sank into the cushion. Before the church clock struck two, Eve was asleep.</p>

<!-- CHAPTER XXIV-->
<p>
That night, Herminia Barton went up sadly to her own bedroom. It was the very
last night that Dolores was to sleep under the same roof with her mother. On
the morrow, she meant to remove to Sir Anthony Merrick’s.
</p>

<p>
As soon as Herminia had closed the door, she sat down to her writing-table and
began to write. Her pen moved of itself. And this was her letter:—
</p>
<!-- The div below is a letter. The words "My darling daughter" are small caps -->
<div><p>
“My darling daughter,—By the time you read these words, I shall be
no longer in the way, to interfere with your perfect freedom of action. I had
but one task left in life—to make you happy. Now I find I only stand in
the way of that object, no reason remains why I should endure any longer the
misfortune of living.</p>
    <p>“My child, my child, you must see, when you come to think it over at
leisure, that all I ever did was done, up to my lights, to serve and bless you.
I thought, by giving you the father and the birth I did, I was giving you the
best any mother on earth had ever yet given her dearest daughter. I believe it
still; but I see I should never succeed in making <i>you</i> feel it. Accept
this reparation. For all the wrong I may have done, all the mistakes I may have
made, I sincerely and earnestly implore your forgiveness. I could not have had
it while I lived; I beseech and pray you to grant me dead what you would never
have been able to grant me living.</p>
    <p>“My darling, I thought you would grow up to feel as I did; I thought
you would thank me for leading you to see such things as the blind world is
incapable of seeing. There I made a mistake; and sorely am I punished for it.
Don’t visit it upon my head in your recollections when I can no longer
defend myself.</p>
    <p>“I set out in life with the earnest determination to be a martyr to
the cause of truth and righteousness, as I myself understood them. But I
didn’t foresee this last pang of martyrdom. No soul can tell beforehand
to what particular cross the blind chances of the universe will finally nail
it. But I am ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is close at
hand. I have fought a good fight; I have finished my course; I have kept the
faith I started in life with. Nothing now remains for me but the crown of
martyrdom. My darling, it is indeed a very bitter cup to me that you should
wish me dead; but ‘tis a small thing to die, above all for the sake of
those we love. I die for you gladly, knowing that by doing so I can easily
relieve my own dear little girl of one trouble in life, and make her course lie
henceforth through smoother waters. Be happy! be happy! Goodbye, my Dolly! Your
mother’s love go forever through life with you!</p>
    <p>“Burn this blurred note the moment you have read it. I enclose a more
formal one, giving reasons for my act on other grounds, to be put in, if need
be, at the coroner’s inquest. Good-night, my heart’s darling. Your
truly devoted and affectionate</p>
<!-- The word mother is in caps and right justified -->
<p>MOTHER.</p>
</div>
<p>
“Oh, Dolly, my Dolly, you never will know with what love I loved
you.”</p>

<p>
When she had finished that note, and folded it reverently with kisses and
tears, she wrote the second one in a firm hand for the formal evidence. Then
she put on a fresh white dress, as pure as her own soul, like the one she had
worn on the night of her self-made bridal with Alan Merrick. In her bosom she
fastened two innocent white roses from Walter Brydges’s bouquet,
arranging them with studious care very daintily before her mirror. She was
always a woman. “Perhaps,” she thought to herself, “for her
lover’s sake, my Dolly will kiss them. When she finds them lying on her
dead mother’s breast, my Dolly may kiss them.” Then she cried a few
minutes very softly to herself; for no one can die without some little regret,
some consciousness of the unique solemnity of the occasion.
</p>

<p>
At last she rose and moved over to her desk. Out of it she took a small
glass-stoppered phial, that a scientific friend had given her long ago for use
in case of extreme emergency. It contained prussic acid. She poured the
contents into a glass and drank it off. Then she lay upon her bed and waited
for the only friend she had left in the world, with hands folded on her breast,
like some saint of the middle ages.
</p>

<p>
Not for nothing does blind fate vouchsafe such martyrs to humanity. From their
graves shall spring glorious the church of the future.
</p>

<p>
When Dolores came in next morning to say goodbye, she found her mother’s
body cold and stiff upon the bed, in a pure white dress, with two crushed white
roses just peeping from her bodice.
</p>

<p>
Herminia Barton’s stainless soul had ceased to exist for ever.

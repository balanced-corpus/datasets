<!-- chapter title: UP TO LONDON -->

<p>The stranger remained behind at the grave after we had left. But we had only been a short time at home when he strode into the bar.</p>

<p>“Are you the landlord?” he asked my uncle, speaking with a peculiar accent.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Boston—Eli Boston—the landlord.”</p>

<p>“I am in search,” said the other, “of the goods and papers of the deceased gentleman. As his son and lawful heir I claim his property.”</p>

<p>Mr. Marlo was close by, and came forward.</p>

<p>“My name is Marlo. I am a solicitor. In me you see the sole executor of the will of the late Mr. Edward Traill. The property he left here I have removed to London, and have also secured in my house other boxes which were to have followed Mr. Traill into Shropshire, had he lived. If you will be good enough to come to my house in Bloomsbury to-morrow, about noon—or let us say the next day—the will shall be read to you, and I shall then proceed to take out probate.”</p>

<p>An angry shade came over the young man’s eyes.</p>

<p>“And pray what connexion have you with the late honourable gentleman ? ” he asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Marlo replied, “The legal firm, of which I am head, have, for many years, been confidential lawyers to the Traill family. I was summoned, as all these know, by Mr. Edward Traill to draw up his will, and it was duly executed according to form.”</p>

<p>“Don’t try tricks,” the other rejoined, ” that is all I say. I have powerful interest, being known to princes and governors, and shall certainly crush my enemies.”</p>

<p>“Intemperate language,” said Mr. Marlo, “is quite out of place. You are invited to inspect the will, and to satisfy yourself as to what provisions it contains.”</p>

<p>“My father was a weak, dying man. Who knows what force or fraud was used with him? I am solitary son and heir. By the laws of civilised countries I succeed to his goods and chattels. Those who oppose me will suffer.”</p>

<p>“If you should think yourself wronged the courts are open.”</p>

<p>“Courts !” exclaimed the young man, with great scorn. ” Yes, yes, and the judges sitting and waiting with open palms.”</p>

<p>With this remark Muzaffar bounced out of the house, and walked off along the high road towards London, intending, as we supposed, to take the first coach that passed him.</p>

<p>We looked at each other as he left the house, and Mr. Marlo smiled and said, ” It is very strange that young man should be here. He must be Mr. Traill’s son. But the deceased gentleman told me he was in India, and provided for, with a good post at a native court.”</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Marlo again proposed that I should go up to London with him, and stay at his house, where the will would be read, and where I should be at hand whilst probate was applied for.</p>

<p>My uncle, however, had evidently not forgotten Mr. Marlo’s outburst of temper.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, ” I will bring Alice up myself. You are good to ask her, but there is an inn at Holborn I always use, and we will call upon you from there. We shall be ready to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>Marlo looked annoyed, but he could only acquiesce in the plan, and went off by himself on the first coach that was available.</p>

<p>Martin, who had ridden over on horseback, had business at Daventry, but promised to come back to supper.</p>

<p>I had to set to work at once to get things ready, and to put up the two best dresses I possessed, and to retrim my best bonnet, for I had always been pretty good as a milliner. I had visited London in a country bumpkin sort of way, and it was associated in my mind with Sunday clothes.</p>

<p>My aunt was most kind in helping. Once she said, in a low voice, after we had been silent awhile, “Alice, if the poor gentleman should turn out to have been rich, and has remembered you handsomely, you won’t despise your old uncle and aunt ? “</p>

<p>The tears sprang into my eyes.</p>

<p>“O auntie ! ” I cried, ” you do not think so badly of me as to believe that a mere accident could change my heart ! “</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” she answered cheerfully, but her words had sunk into my mind. And I felt a dread I could not express about Martin. He had seemed very pleased when my present was talked about, and viewed it as a windfall for me, which was likely to enable me to dress myself for some months at my own expense, and perhaps take a trip somewhere. But how would he feel if he knew of the expression, ” the arrangements made in your favour ” ? He must know, I said to myself. And so that evening, after supper, when he and I were in the garden, though I had firmly intended to keep the memorandum to myself, I showed it to Martin.</p>

<p>How vividly the scene returns !</p>

<p>He was dressed in a brown coat with brass buttons, breeches and leather gaiters, and he had tied his thonged riding-whip by its lash round his chest. We were in a walk near the apple espaliers, and he was in front of me. When he had read the paper he did not turn round, but held it in his hand, and still sauntered on.</p>

<p>“Martin !” I called out, ” have you nothing to say ? “</p>

<p>When he looked at me I was really quite frightened. He was so pale.</p>

<p>“What <em>is</em> matter?”</p>

<p>He would not answer for some time, but I pressed him, and at last he got out, ” I am in love with you, Alice, not with your money.”</p>

<p>“Well, dearest,” I said, ” who does not know that ? When I first saw you were fond of me, where was Mr. Traill ? And who could have dreamed he would come here ? “</p>

<p>“That is true,” he rejoined, ” but we have silently agreed not to make our understanding public, on account of my father. But if he hears of your having means, he will be sure to say, ‘ Martin, this is the very thing for you, try and go in and carry off the heiress.’ And then what will people think? Young Martin could not make up his mind till he heard of the rhino. I shall look honourable, shan’t I ? And this is supposing the best.”</p>

<p>“And what is the worst ? ” I asked, laughing.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps, when you have had a lift in the worid, you may look higher than a farmer.”</p>

<p>“Martin, Martin!” I said reproachfully, for I felt hurt, though I knew he had not the least intention of expressing anything but a modest opinion of his own merits and position.</p>

<p>When he saw I was pained, he caught me in his arms, and I felt his warm tears on my cheek.</p>

<p>“I would sooner,” he whispered, in a broken voice, ” you had had a nice present, which you could have enjoyed, and have done with.”</p>

<p>I replied, ” We really know nothing ; all turns on a vague expression—’arrangements’ ; and do believe, once for all”—I think I spoke passionately, for I felt strongly  “that whatever happens, I shall remain Alice Boston—with Alice’s heart, and Alice’s fidelity.”</p>

<p>It was the time to speak ; and Martin said many gentle and kind things which I often repeated over to myself afterwards ; and I swore to him, in the rising moonlight and amongst the shadowing fruit-trees, that I would be his own love, in riches or in poverty, and would endeavour to double his joys and halve his sorrows—which was a thought Emily had given me once, out of a German poetry book, and I was so glad to remember to use it this night.</p>

<p>“It is cowardly to doubt,” Martin said, as we turned towards the inn, ” and I will now rely on you as much as I love you.”</p>

<p>When I went to bed I felt much happier about the future. It is no affectation, however, but simple truth, to say I hoped ” arrangements ” might mean a small but well-secured allowance, which would assist us materially in business, but not put me in a position noticeably different from that of Martin. And so, even before the money had got near me, it began to cause some anxiety.</p>

<p>I had sent word, in the middle of my packing, to Emily, that I would come and see her next day, early in the morning. And so before seven o’clock I found my way down the village street, at the end of which I met my friend coming our way, with her great dog, Hector. Breaking resolutions is a bad habit, and, like other bad habits, the more it is indulged in the easier it becomes. Well—of course I did not intend to tell Emily about the note in poor Mr. Traill’s handwriting, which I had found ; but having made an exception in Martin’s case, it seemed more difficult to remain silent, and so—I did tell her.</p>

<p>She jumped to golden conclusions.</p>

<p>The East, with her, had lost nothing of its gems and barbaric splendour, and she was firmly under the impression I should be a great heiress.</p>

<p>I do not think I seriously believed her, but her fervid talking helped, with everything else that had occurred, to worry my brain a little.</p>

<p>“And how about Martin ? ” she asked, slily.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Emily ? ” I replied.</p>

<p>“Can you make a prince of him ? Will not he do for an early attachment—a dream of the morning—a regret—a remembrance ? “</p>

<p>“I am sure you are joking, or else I should be sadly hurt. What a poor, vapid creature people must think me, if they suppose that a windfall could suddenly change my nature, like a clap of thunder turning the small beer sour ! No, I hope my heart is made of more durable stuff than to succumb to a gust of fortune. But you are not in earnest, Emily. Look at your own case ; why, would prosperity cause you to cast aside Alonzo ? “</p>

<p>“No, indeed. But he is destined for great things. However, never mind. Let us talk of something else. How deeply interesting the man of colour was at the burial ! That, of course, must be the Indian son Mr. Traill spoke of to you. But how did he get here? Alice, are you not afraid of him ? He will dispute the inheritance with you.”</p>

<p>“He was in such a pet afterwards, at the <em>Pied Bull</em> ; asking where Mr. Traill’s baggage was, and so cross with Mr. Marlo. And then, off he bolted towards London without ‘with your leave or by your leave.’ I am afraid he will give trouble. But the lawyer must fight him, if he is to be fought.”</p>

<p>“These wild Asiatic natures stick at nothing. Per haps he will poison you.”</p>

<p>I was shocked at this, and felt a tremor pass through me ; and so turned towards Emily, and stared her in the face. I have often thought since that I observed quite a peculiar look pass over her features : but it is very difficult to know whether impressions of this kind are born after events, and transfer themselves to an earlier period, or whether presentiments really exist.</p>

<p>However, I only said, ” Do not talk of such horrid things.”</p>

<p>Then she turned to the subject of Mr. Marlo. She spoke very eagerly :</p>

<p>“Does your Mr. Marlo spell his name with only an ‘o’?”</p>

<p>“M—a—r—l—o, his name is.”</p>

<p>“The great poet’s name [I am afraid I had not heard of the fact] was, in his life-time, spelt sometimes like that. But ‘ l—o—w ‘ is more common. Has your man a son, do you know? “</p>

<p>“When he asked me to come up to his house, I think he said his daughter was away, but that his son would be there.”</p>

<p>“His daughter would be away,” repeated Emily, thoughtfully. ” Do your Marlos ever go to Bognor ? “</p>

<p>“I never heard they did.”</p>

<p>“I cannot say more. But great mysteries are closing around us. It is all wonderful. And, just at this juncture, my aunt, Miss Maude, has asked me to visit her. I do not mind leaving papa, because he is always so anxious that I should avail myself of seeing a little society. And nurse Jenkins is fond of the old man, and looks after him as she would after a child. Besides—”</p>

<p>And here Emily heaved a great sigh.</p>

<p>“What was coming,” I urged, “after ‘ besides ‘ ? “</p>

<p>“Ah, dearest Alice, a little grief of my own. But it is a favourite belief of mine that those who are very wedded to books have scarcely time for other affections.”</p>

<p>“Do not say that; I am sure your papa is very proud of you.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, let us hope so. But I wish he would show a little bit more love. Now mind, Alice, if your Marlos <em>are</em> people who come to Bognor, be sure and come with them. It will be immense fun.”</p>

<p>We were in Emily’s garden now : the delicate odour of flowers floated on the fresh morning air, and a few of the birds were still full of song. Beyond the poplars the church tower rose, and the graves were in its shadow, amongst them the new one where we had laid the Indian gentleman. Emily and I both felt a little solemn ; some drama seemed be ginning, we scarcely knew what. We tried to talk of trivial things, but they seemed out of place ; for, somehow, we were both impressed with the idea that the careless time was ending.</p>

<p>When I took leave, Emily did not offer to accompany me any part of the way back, for she was anxious to pay all attention to her father, who was now stirring. I see her at this moment, in her straw hat, at the gate, with Hector standing beside her. She waves her farewell.</p>

<p>We had chosen the <em>Wonder</em> to go by, and Martin had ridden over to see us start. Our things were put out on the margin of the road.</p>

<p>To our surprise, the coach was a little late, and when it came, we were still more astonished to see Mr. Wilcocks alight. He walked with quite an unsteady step towards the inn, and my uncle sprang forward to accompany him. He had had an attack of vertigo, and was feeling badly. I, too, went back to see what could be done. And to us standing in the bar, Sutton, the guard, brought Martin.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Wilcocks,” he said, ” here’s the very man. I am sure you are not well enough to go further. Mrs. Boston will set you right, and you will be as fresh as a carnation to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Well,” if <em>you</em> will drive,” rejoined the coachman looking at Martin, ” I have perfect confidence in you, and give you up my seat without an anxious thought. You have driven our <em>Stag</em> before now, and I know you for a workman.”</p>

<p>Martin was excited, but quite equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>“I would do anything to oblige you, sir,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“You must keep the pace up,” Wilcocks whispered, ” we are rather behind. And be careful on Towcester Hills. Good-bye, and thank you, dear boy.”</p>

<p>There were two seats vacant behind the coach-box, and we were soon trotting full pace. Martin’s broad shoulders, in his brown coat and brass buttons, were just in front of me, and he with his strong arms driving with great nerve and precision.</p>

<p>At the first stage Sutton brought his watch to compare with the coach-clock fixed just under the box.</p>

<p>“We are between seven and eight minutes late Mr. Welfare, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I will make it up,” said Martin, ” before we reach Barnet.”</p>

<p>I felt so happy. I had been the least bit piqued at Emily saying, ” O, Alonzo is destined for great things,” and I inwardly remarked, but I hope not un kindly, ” It will be a good thing if he but do not think Alonzo could drive the <em>Wonder.</em> “</p>

<p>We took a hackney coach from the <em>Bull and Mouth</em> and drove to the inn my uncle used in Holborn, or rather just out of Holborn, or rather just out of Holborn—the <em>Rose</em> tavern.</p>

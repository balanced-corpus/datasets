<title>Chapter 2 of A MAN OF GENIUS by HENRY MURRAY</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- II -->
<p>
Rather over a year later, on a beautiful spring afternoon, Walter Menteith was sitting in the little copse which overlooks the village of Market Merton. In dress and general appearance he presented as complete a contrast with the shabby spectre of a year ago as could easily be imagined. The ravages of illness and hunger had passed from his features, leaving no trace. The disorderly mane of hair had been trimmed to decent proportions, and he was glorious in a jacket of black velveteen, a shirt of pale pink silk, a flowing tie of chocolate tint, shoes of fine kid, and a broad-leaved dove-colored wideawake. He was watching, with considerable interest, the long ribbon of road which ran from his feet down the little eminence on which the copse was situated, and, a hundred yards away, joined the main street of the village, bordered by a single row of scattered two-storey tenements, which overlooked a rolling expanse of grass and cornfield. White with the powdery dust of a fortnight’s rainless weather, the road glittered in the afternoon sun, empty of passengers, to a bend at a mile or so of distance, where it was lost to view behind a line of poplars. Presently a slowly moving speck came into sight from behind the trees. Walter bent forward a little, peering hard at the distant figure. It advanced with irritating slowness within recognition distance.
</p>
<p>
“That’s Ned, sure enough,” said Walter. “He’s carrying a carpet bag.”
</p>
<p>
The still distant wayfarer stopped, lowered his burden to the ground, and sat on it, mopping his face with a white handkerchief before continuing his toilsome way in the hot sunshine. By the time he had reached the first of the scattered line of houses he showed symptoms of fatigue and distress, and again sat on the carpet bag while holding parley with a rustic damsel in a striped gown and sun-bonnet, who appeared from her pantomime to be giving him directions to the house he sought — a small cottage, standing back from the road, a hundred yards beyond the main body of the village. With the girl’s assistance, the traveller again hoisted his burden to his shoulder, and plodded resolutely on. He rolled like a ship in a gale before he reached the house he sought, and was fain, when he came to the gate, to drop the carpet bag to the ground and lean for support against the pailings. He was standing so when the cottage door opened, and Ada’s slight figure, clad in a pretty countrified dress of pink and white, tripped down the garden walk, between the rows of flowering shrubs. The traveller turned at the sound of her steps. She paused in her advance, and, after a short pause of doubt, accosted him. He took off his soft black hat before replying, and, after a minute’s talk with her, pointed interrogatively towards the copse, from which every motion of this little comedy was visible to the concealed watcher. Ada nodded, and after a few seconds’ further talk the traveller took up the carpet bag again, and staggered with it into the cottage. Emerging, he seemed to decline some proffered hospitality, and, with another salute of the soft black hat, passed out of the cottage garden and made for the copse, Ada, shading her eyes with her hand, looking after him.
</p>
<p>
At this point Walter rose from his seat, and keeping well within the shadow of the trees, slid with a careful avoidance of noise through branches and undergrowth to the further side of the little copse. Here, a twisted tree stump made a natural seat, overlooking a wide, rolling expanse of meadow land. Walter sat, and having carefully disposed the wrinkles of the lavender trousers in graceful folds, drew a note-book and pencil from his pocket, and corrugated his brows into an aspect of the profoundest reflection. It took a minute or two to compose his features quite to his satisfaction, but by the time that the traveller’s step sounded at the entrance of the thicket the expression was perfect. The traveller, coming suddenly upon Walter, saw it, and kept back the phrase of hearty recognition which had leapt to his lips, looking at the abstracted face with a smile of almost canine reverence and affection. He was a small man, broad in relation to his height, flat-chested, long-armed, with the knotted, muscular hands of a workman; not too clean. His skin was of a reddish pallor; his eyes, deep sunk under a huge dome of forehead, but protruding from their orbits, were violet in colour; the hollow cheeks and full red lips were fringed with a thick growth of chestnut beard, and long masses of hair of a slightly darker tint escaped from under his hat. A wild, sagacious-looking little man. He wore a clean linen collar, and a too-obviously new red tie. His shabby clothes were powdered with the dust of the road, and his trousers bore splashes of dried mud, though no rain had fallen for days. His age might have been anything between five-and-twenty and forty. He had been panting heavily as he came through the copse, but suppressed his stertorous breath at sight of his friend’s dreaming face, and breathed as lightly as a mother watching the sleep of her first-born. He was debating the propriety of retiring until the poetic afflatus he dreaded to dissipate should have evaporated of its own accord, and had already made a backward step, when, with a sigh of irritated resignation, Walter closed his note-book.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t fix it. It’s gone,” he said, and rose with a yawn and stretch. In the very act his eye fell upon the intruder, and he started forward with a beaming smile of surprise. “Why, Ned, old man! You here! I hadn’t expected you for hours yet.” He looked down on the little man with a regal air of patronising welcome.
</p>
<p>
“I told you the train I was comin’ by in my letter,” said the small man, speaking with a slow, broad, rustic accent. “The four-twenty.”
</p>
<p>
“But it’s not that yet, surely,” said the other. “By Jove, I suppose it is, though! And I had meant to come and meet you at the station. You must excuse me, old fellow. When I once got absorbed, thinking about my work —” He threw his hands abroad —” But you’re tired, old chap. Sit down, and let us have a look at you.”
</p>
<p>
Ned accepted the seat, and his companion, leaning against a neighbouring trunk, looked down on him with a sort of proprietorial approbation.
</p>
<p>
“I <em>am</em> a trifle fagged,” Ned confessed. “It’s a scorchin’ day, and I carried my bag all the way from the station.”
</p>
<p>
“And how did you come to find me here?”
</p>
<p>
“A young lady came out of the house — the landlord’s daughter, I reckon — an’ told me as you was here.” He went on with a wink of simple would-be-knowing admiration, “She’s a wunner for looks! Catch Walter Menteith living in a house where there warn’t a pretty girl! I say, Walter, what a swell you’ve got!” His eye travelled over his friend’s dress. “Is that shirt silk?” Walter nodded. “My eye! I reckon th’ old folks ‘d ha’ been a bit proud if they ha’ lived to see this. But we’re all proud of you. You should ha’ heard the row there was in the town about your book — the first one, I mean, ‘Cobwebs.’ Doctor Purdy, as is on the Libery Committee, proposed as they should buy two copies of it, an’ old Banks, the minister at Bethel Chapel, he opposed. Said as it was a filthy an’ immoral publication, not fit for dacent folks to read, and as it ought to be burned by the common hangman. Then the Doctor, he tackled him fair, an’ there was a lively srimmage betwixt ‘em, and at last he made Banks confess as he’d niver read it. But the Committee refused to buy it all the same; and all the better, for ivery word of the debate was published in next Saturday’s <em>Advertiser</em>, and pretty nigh on everybody in the place bought a copy to read on the sly. Banks got you into one of his sermons — not by name, but everybody knew who he was gettin’ at. He talked about them as pervert the talents given ‘em by God to the use of the Evil One. He ain’t forgot the way you used to score off him at the Mutual Improvement Society. But you lnow, Walter, it <em>was</em> a bit near the knuckle. You hit off th’ old place and the old people capital in ‘A Village Comedy.’ You’ve got ‘em to the life. There was one as wasn’t pleased, though; I reckon you can guess who it was.”
</p>
<p>
“I dare say I might if I tried.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah!” continued Ned, “you hit old Drinkwater pretty hard. He was mad about it, I can tell you. They say as he went to Baggs the lawyer, and wanted him to start an action against you. It was the standin’ joke at the Institute t’ ask him if he’d read the <em>Metropolitan</em>. Jim Ferrar carried the joke a bit too far, though. He got hold of Soft Tommy, an’ sent him into Drinkwater’s shop to buy a copy, and Drinkwater set about him and well-nigh killed him. Tommy had a look in, though. He made Drinkwater’s nose bleed. Jim wanted to gammon Tommy into prosecutin’ Drinkwater for assault and battery, but I give him a shillin’ and sent him home.”
</p>
<p>
Walter listened to those revelations of his influence in his native place with a look of mild boredom.
</p>
<p>
“It’s flattering to find one’s work appreciated,” he said, with a half yawn, “though it was a little hard on Drinkwater. I had not expected my satire to carry so far.’
</p>
<p>
“I was at the ‘Fox an’ Dogs’ with two or three of the chaps last night, and we talked about nothing else but you. You ain’t forgotten down there, I can tell you.”
</p>
<p>
“Very good of them,” said Walter, “though they are hardly the audience which satisfies my longing for literary fame.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Ned, a little dashed. “I suppose not. But they’re very good fellows, all the same. It’s the longish time since you left the old place,” he continued, after a retrospective pause. “More than seven year. I reckon you’ve had your ups an’ downs. I often used to think about you and wonder how you was gettin’ on. I knew as you were bound to come right side up. Brains win all the world over. I’m sorry as the old man died afore your success. He used to come and sit by me in the turnin’ shop sometimes, and talk about you. ‘He ain’t set the Thames afire yet,’ he’d say. ‘Give him time, Mr. Menteith,’ I used to tell him. ‘Give him time. You’ll hear of him before lone. He’ll come to the front, and you’ll be proud of him.’”
</p>
<p>
“It’s very curious,” said Walter, polishing his nails on the breast of his jacket and speaking slowly as he examined their sheen in the sunlight, “very curious, indeed, that sort of yokel incapacity for recognising brains in a member of one’s own family. A man’s relatives are always the last to see anything out of the common in him.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, but,” cried Ned, “the old man <em>did</em> believe in you.”
</p>
<p>
“He took a rather queer method of showing it, don’t you think?” asked Walter.
</p>
<p>
“What he didn’t like,” said Ned, “was your going away and throwing up the business. That was what made him so bitter about you. He thought you might ha’ stopped and seen it through while he was alive.”
</p>
<p>
“And have wasted the best years of my life in that infernal hole, without one decently intelligent creature to speak a word to!”
</p>
<p>
Ned coughed and blinked slightly.
</p>
<p>
“By Heaven, Ned! the selfishness of people is beyond belief. When I went down to the funeral everybody sang the same song. That old fool, Aunt Mary, said I had killed the old man, and that she wondered that I dared to come into the house his body lay in. I ask you,” he continued, leaving the tree against which he had been leaning and standing upright with outstretched hands of vehement self-defence, “I ask you, what could I have done? What would any man have done? Suppose that I had stayed. The business had gone to the devil years before. The plant was old, and we had no money to buy new. Whole days in the week we had nothing to do but bite our nails and wait for work. And people talk as if I’d ruined my father, when they knew that he was ruined before I left him. I’ll tell you what it comes to. It’s the old story. The stupidities can never forgive a man for having brains. They’ll pardon anything but that. I dared to aspire, to dream of doing something more than any of the brainless crew had ever thought of. I am the only man the family every produced who made himself heard of beyond the street he lived in, and that’s the head and front of my offending. It’s always the same. There never was a great man who sprang from that class who didn’t have the same experience. They can’t understand that the child they’ve begotten should be different from them. His ambition is an insult to their supineness. ‘Do you think <em>you</em> can teach the public anything?’ my father used to ask me. No sympathy, no encouragement, not even the faintest comprehension of — of — — It makes me ill when I think of it.”
</p>
<p>
Ned looked with sympathetic sadness at the handsome figure before him, and nodded reflectively twice or thrice.
</p>
<p>
“You might ha’ wrote to th’ old man a bit oftener, though, Walter,” he said, after a pause.
</p>
<p>
“For Gods’ sake,” said Walter, “speak English! You can when you choose.”
</p>
<p>
“You might have written oftener, then,” said Ned. “I like the old speech best when I’m away from home. It brings the old place back to me somehow.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want the old place brought back to <em>me</em>, thank you,” said Walter, with a savage moodiness. “I’ve had enough of it to last me my lifetime. What was I to write about? We hadn’t an idea in common. He couldn’t, or wouldn’t, understand me, or know anything of the life I was leading, my struggles or my hopes. It was like writing to a man on another planet to write to him. And his letters upset me terribly. There was one I got, while he was going through the Bankruptcy Court, which kept me from working for two whole days. People haven’t an idea what the artistic temperament is, and how easily the mechanism is thrown out of gear. A man <em>can’t</em> work when he is badgered in that way. And he would keep on hinting that if I’d stayed at home the business might have been saved. You know well enough what rot that was. Had I any knowledge of the business? Had I ever taken any interest in it? Oh, confound it, let’s talk of something else! What are your plans? You didn’t say much in your letter.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Ned, with a little blush at his temerity, and with something of the air with which a sly lover might speak of his sweetheart to a confidant, “I’m going to settle in London, and try my luck at lit — at writing.” He chose the simpler word almost with an air of propitation, as if to have said, “literature” would have sounded boastful and offensive. “I’ve got a bit o’ moneym not much, but enough to keep me for a couple of years or so. My uncle left me a hundred, and I’d saved another seventy, doing a bit of overtime in the pattern shop, and helping young Mr. Bennett with his mathematics.”
</p>
<p>
“Going in for literature, eh?” said Walter, re-establishing himself against the tree trunk and looking down on him with a half-amused, interested patronage. “What kind of literature?”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Ned again, slipping back partially into his rustic speech. “I’ve been readin’ a good deal o’ modern philosophy this last ‘ear or two, and makin’ notes for a History of Modern Thought. It’s a biggish subject, and I reckon I’ve got another two years’ stiffish readin’ to do afore I shall be able really to begin. The Germans are doing a lot in that way just now, and it isn’t easy to keep up with ‘em. That’s what made me settle on coming to London. I couldn’t get all the books I wanted at the Coketon Library. They’ve got a fair set of the English writers, but they’re weak in the Germans and the French. An’ then, besides, it takes it out of a man to walk in an’ out every day. A matter of fifteen miles, I reckon it is.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! I remember you used to go in for that sort of thing. I never cared much for it myself,” said Walter allowingly, “but I should think it’s the sort of thing you might succeed in.”
</p>
<p>
“I want to have a day or two here with you, and then get to London,” Ned continued. “I should like to get somewhere near the Museum. Lodgin’s are pretty cheap there, they say, for London. Jim Ferrar told me as he got a room for six shilling a week in Museum street. Can you put up here for a night or two?”
</p>
<p>
“Not at the cottage, I’m afraid,” said Walter. “I’ve got the only rooms not occupied by the landlord’s family. We’ll find you a room next door, or somewhere. It’s getting on for dinner-time, I should say,” he continued, “if I can trust my interior monitor.”
</p>
<p>
“Six o’clock,” said Ned, consulting a pale-faced silver watch.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll get home, then; Ada will be ready for us by now.”
</p>
<p>
“Ada!” repeated Ned. “Who is she?”
</p>
<p>
“Ada!” said walter, pulling at his beard, as they walked side by side through the copse, “Ada is Mrs. Walter Menteith.”
</p>
<p>
Ned stopped short, his eyes distending and obtruding.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Walt — — Why, Walter, you don’t mean to say you’re married!”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Have</em> I said I was married?” asked Walter, looking back over his shoulder. “Come along, man, dinner will be waiting.”
</p>
<p>
“But, I say, Walter —”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes,” said Menteith, with a kind of forbearing impatience, “I know. Suppose you said it. I left the morals of Little Bethel behind me some time since.”
</p>
<p>
“Why,” said Ned, “so did I. But it’s a bit of a staggerer.”
</p>
<p>
Walter made no reply, and they reached the edge of the thicket in silence.
</p>
<p>
“How long has this been going on?”
</p>
<p>
“About five years,” said Walter.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Ned, recovering from the shock,“‘so many men, so many minds.’ I should have though as if it was worth while to live with a woman all that time it was worth while to marry her.”
</p>
<p>
“‘So many men, so many minds,” as you say,” replied Walter in the tone with which a man seeks to close a distasteful conversation.
</p>
<p>
“What’s she like?” asked Ned, stopped on one tack, and, unable to leave the subject, taking the first which came to hand.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve seen her,” answered Walter. “She directed you where to find me, an hour ago. At least,” he added quickly, remembering that he was not supposed to have witnessed the interview, “I suppose it was she. She’s the only girl in the house, except the slavey, and you spoke of her being pretty, which the slavey certainly isn’t.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Ned, “she’s pretty.” He repeated the words mechanically and thought fully. “She’s pretty. About three-and-twenty, I should think, eh? What’d beat me,” he went on, without waiting for an answer, “in a case of that sort, ‘d be how to leave the girl, if ever I should want to. I should be always thinking about it — it would spoil all the pleasure I should get in her society.” Walter made no answer. “Why don’t you marry her? She’s pretty enough, and you must be fond of each other, or you wouldn’t have stayed together all this time.”
</p>
<p>
“My dear Ned,” said Menteith, with some impatience struggling with a rather vague air of superiority, “there are matters in which the interferences of the oldest friend is a little out of place.”
</p>
<p>
Ned accepted the aphoristic rebuke, and they went on together silently. As they reached the brow of the slope a carriage came into sight round the trees which fringed the bend of the road a mile away, and advanced so rapidly that as they came to the foot of the declivity it passed between them and the line of cottages. A lady, half-concealed from view behind a laced sunshade, leant back upon the cushions, and beside her, enveloped in furs and wraps, sat an aged-looking man, with a pale, drawn face, and locks of gray hair visible under his depressed hat-brim. Walter stood still for a moment, looking after the equipage as it rolled away.
</p>
<p>
“Who’s that?” asked Ned, from behind the pipe he had lit while descending the hill.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Carson,” answered Walter. “She’s the local swell, and my landlady — or, at least, my landlord’s. She owns the village, and most of the land hereabouts.”
</p>
<p>
“She’s a fine figure of a woman,” said Ned. “Who was that poor, shrivelled-up looking chap with her?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s her husband.”
</p>
<p>
“Her husband!” cried Ned. “I should ha’ thought that a woman like that might ha’ made a better bargain. They look like Death an’ the Lady takin’ a ride together.”
</p>
<p>
“He was not like that when she married him though,” Walter answered. “Mrs. Tickle, my landlady, told me the story. She was their cook until a few months ago. It was an accident which happened one night in Paris, four years ago. They had left the opera, and were waiting for their carriage. The footpath was like a sheet of ice. Mr. Carson lost his balance, and fell under a horse’s feet. He would have been killed if it hadn’t been for his wife. She dragged him out at the risk of her life, and nursed him after — never left his side till he was well, or as well as he ever will be, poor beggar. He hasn’t walked a step this four years, I’m told, and never will again. He’s dead from the waist downwards.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah!” said Ned, “there’s better things than money in the world, after all. It’s hard lines on a chap to be spoiled for life like that.”
</p>
<p>
“He seems to have been a fine fellow, too,” said Walter. “Mrs. Tickle’s never tired of talking about him. Splendid shot and rider. Saved two people’s lives one from a burning house and one at sea, and has the Humane Society’s medal and clasp. He’s gone in for science and art since his accident. He’s had one of the towers at the hall fitted up as an observatory, and spends whole nights watching the stars. He paints, too, and paints very finely, I’m told by better critics than Mrs. Tickle. It’s a curious thing,” he continued after a pause. “I can’t make it out at all; but I can’t get rid of the idea that I’ve met Mrs. Carson somewhere — that I’ve spoken to her — known her. It’s a most curious sort of sensation — something like those sudden memories of dreams which flash across the mind and are gone before you can seize them. I get it every time I see her.”
</p>
<p>
“You may have met her,” suggested Ned, “in London.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Walter, “I’m as sure as I can be of anything — as sure as I am of my own existence — that it’s only a fancy, and yet I can’t get rid of it. If we’ve ever met before, it was in some prior existence; it certainly wasn’t in this one.”
</p>
<p>
They were at the door of the cottage by this time, where their nostrils were tickled by the appetising odour of roasting meat.
</p>
<p>
“I say,” said Ned, “I’d like a rinse before supper, if you don’t mind. I’m a bit grimy with the railway journey.”
</p>
<p>
The explanation of his desire for soap and water before a meal, and his calling the six o’clock dinner supper, provoked a flickering smile on his companion’s face.
</p>
<p>
“Come along up,” he said at the foot of the stairs. “Sh-sh! Tread lightly.”
</p>
<p>
Ned entered the bedroom as gingerly as if the landing had been paved with eggs, looking furtively round for the cause of his friend’s warning. His eye fell on a cradle at the foot of the bed.
</p>
<p>
“Good Lord!” he exclaimed, half aloud. “A baby!” and stood staring at the phenomenon, chapfallen and protuberant of eye.
</p>
<p>
“Come along, man,” said Walter, “don’t be all night over it. They’re taking in the dinner.”
</p>
<p>
Ablutions completed, they descended to the ground floor, where Ada was waiting for them.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve met already, I hear,” said Walter easily. “Still, one may as well go through the presentation in form. Mrs. Menteith — Mr. Edward Kershaw.”
</p>
<p>
The rustic little man was perturbed in mind; but rusticity is an excuse of wide application, and served to explain his awkward acceptance of the introduction, his antic performances with spoon and knife duirng the earlier stages of the meal, and his continued fire of covert glances from Walter to Ada and back again. Occasional excursions into the realms of foreign fiction had given him some vague notions of the manners and customs of artistic Bohemia, and he suffered now under still vaguer expectations of seeing this irregularly-joined couple do something startling. The abscence of champagne from the table was a passing trouble to his mind, not that he coveted the costly beverage for his own drinking, but it stood in his intelligence as a sort of algebraic sign of general defiance of social laws. Alphonse and Lisette always drank champagne when Aphonse was prosperous. He remembered a spiritual sketch illustrative of a scene in a French novel of student life, which represented Lisette wearing Alphonse’s hat and smoking a cigar, with her heels upon the table, while Alphonse, similarly disposed, wore Lisette’s bonnet, and smoked a pipe of abnormal size and strange formation. Perhaps some understanding of Ned’s feelings was present in Ada’s mind. She was silent, and blushed frequently. She could have borne her part gaily enough in the society of most other of Walter’s acquaintances, careless of their knowledge of her position, which she did not even know for certain that Ned shared; but his aspect of gawky innocence disconcerted her innate modesty, though she did the honours of the little table with a natural grace and kindness which, for the moment, added to the small man’s trouble. In these conditions, Walter sought the refuge always open to men of intelligence, and became ostentatiously immersed in his own thoughts, eating and drinking as if in a dream, and occasionally making a hieroglyphic memorandum on his shirt-cuff — proceedings watched by Ada with a silent reverence in her dewy eyes.
</p>
<p>
Dinner over, Walter returned to earth long enough to light a pipe — a proceeding not imitated by Ada, to Ned’s curiously mingled relief and disappointment — and bade his friend do the same. Ada settled herself with a book in the fast declining twilight in the window-seat, and silence fell again until the landlady entered with a lamp, and began to clear the table of the dinner furniture. She passed midway in her task, and addressed Walter.
</p>
<p>
“I took Brown the money you give me for him, sir, and he asked me to thank you for it, with his duty and gratitude. Them was his words, sir; and grateful he was.”
</p>
<p>
Walter looked at her like one aroused by the sound of words which bear no meaning to his mind: a bovine gaze.
</p>
<p>
“Brown! Money!” he repeated.
</p>
<p>
“Deary me!” cried the bustling, wholesome-looking woman, “how muddled you do get in your head, sir, with books and thinkin’! You ought to stop him, mum, really you did. If he haven’t forgot sending that money to poor Jabez Brown, as is down with the rheumatism, only this morning!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes!” said Walter, a little confusedly. “I remember now. Thank you, Mrs. Tickle, for taking it.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank me for taking it, sir!” repeated Mrs. Tickle, with a laugh. “Most people’d be too busy thanking themselves for sending it to think of that. But there, your head’s as soft as your heart, begging your pardon if I’m too free, though you do write books. There’s your name again in the paper, sir,” she continued, with a bursting motherly pride. She stood straighter, the half-folded table-cloth dangling from her hands, and recited, in the sing-song tone of a child repeating a lesson got by rote, “‘The se-ri-al rights of Mr. Walter Menteith’s new novel has been secured by Mr. Crossley, who will make it the principal feature in his new magazine, the first number of which will appear in July,’” She laughed, with pride in her lodger’s fame and delight in having steered so successfully through the breakers of quotation. “I never used to think the paper half so interesting till you come to live here, sir. I looks at it every day now. I showed that paragraph to Mrs. Carson, sir. I went up to the ‘all this morning to ask her about the chimney-pots and the new kitchen sink as Mr. Bolthy, the agent, promised me a year ago, and as Mrs. Carson says shall be done this very week. The affablest lady she is. ‘I must read the gentleman’s book,’ she says. ‘I didn’t know as we was honoured by the presence of a hauthor amongst us’; so I made bold to tell her as I’d heard Mr. Menteith say often how much he’d like to walk in the Hall Wood, and she said, ‘Tell Mr. Menteith I shall be delighted if he will, and I’ll tell my people as he has my permission so to do.’”
</p>
<p>
Ada flushed with a delighted pride as she looked at Walter, who wore the air of bored allowance usual with him while listening to the praises of his satellites.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose Mrs. Carson is very rich?” said Ada.
</p>
<p>
“Rich, mum!” Momentarily uplifted hands and eyes helped the word to convey some faint idea of the extent of the lady’s wealth. “You should see the drawing-room at the Hall. <em>And</em> the bedrooms. And another house in London, as is her property too. And the company she keeps.” She sunk her voice to make the communication. “I’ve cooked for Dukes, mum, when I was in her employ! And that handsome she is! To see her come into a room! Begging your pardon, sir,” she continued to Walter, “this gentleman stops in the village, I think? I’ve seen Mrs. Harris, sir, next door, and he can have the spare room. The key will be left on the winder sill, under the creeper.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, Mrs. Tickle. You have sent his portmanteu in?”

“Oh, yes, sir. Here’s the whisky and the water. Is there anything else you want, sir? No, sir? Good night, mum. Good night, Mr. Menteith. Good night to <em>you</em>, sir.” The voluble lady withdrew.
</p>
<p>
“We’re getting our name up a bit, ain’t we?” said Ned, beaming on Walter and then on Ada.
</p>
<p>
Ada, who had left her seat at the window, leaned over the back of Walter’s chair and smoothed his hair.
</p>
<p>
“I always knew it would come at last. I always said so, didn’t I? I always knew my clever boy would succeed. You <em>are</em> a clever boy,” she said, half defiantly, as Walter’s made an impatient movement to escape her hand.
</p>
<p>
“I am aware of it, my dear,” he said, with a would-be jocose burlesque of his usual self-approval, a quite supererogatory painting of the lily which would have moved the laughter of any observer less saturated with admiration of him than were his two companions. He presented the exhibition of the human peacock spreading his tail before his mate, and basking in her admiration while pretending disdain of it, than which this world of foolish spectacles contains no foolisher. The frankest appeal for flattery would have been more tolerable. Ada possessed to the full that feminine capacity of worship whose too free expression is a veritable poison to such natures as Walter Menteith’s; but even her admiration was hardly more extravagant than Ned’s, in whose eyes Walter’s present glories were heightened by memories of his earlier life. They had worn the seats of their first corduroys on the same school benches; had clubbed their infrequent pence for the purchase of books; had dreamed together in the streets of the pestilent little manufacturing town and in the tranquil fields which surrounded it, vaguely, as boys conscious of higher intelligence than falls to the common lot, of a broader and freer life than that they knew, attainable some day by study and effort. Walter had been the Valentine of the uncouth, studious Orson, whose candid affection he relished and despised. He seemed to know by inspiration that Ned most painfully acquired, and used a vocabulary picked out of books as naturally as his companion spoke the homely dialect of the district.
</p>
<p>
“You should ha’ heard him at the Debating Club at the Institute,” Ned would say to Ada, when their common admiration for their idol had thawed the reserve his shyness had at first created between them. “Never a one as come into the place could stand up agen him, and we had good speakers there, too. Talk! Like a dictionary. Argue! Like a lawyer. He’d coax a fish out of the water, if he gave his mind to it. He’d talk a donkey’s hind leg off. I could never make out where he got his manner o’ speaking. I could never manage it. It’s nature, I reckon.” He no more envied his friend his fine speech, his handsome face and carriage, or any other of his manifold superiorities than a sparrow, reared in the same cage with a canary, would have grudged his fellow captive his plumage or his power of song.
</p>
<p>
When Walter had left the town for London, Ned’s simple faith and affection had followed him, unmingled with any grain of envious bitterness. He had felt a sort of vague wonder that no intellectual earthquake had shaken the capital at his friend’s arrival there, but reflected that it was a big place, and notoriously unkind to young genius. Walter’s letters, fairly regular at first, had grown fewer, and at last had ceased altogether. It was natural, Ned thought, in his honest and unconscious simplicity. How should a man, promoted to the society of such people as would be glad to welcome Water Menteith, find time to read and answer letters from so insignificant a person as Ned Kershaw?
</p>
<p>
For four years he had heard nothing of his idol, when one day he had seen an advertisement of “Cobwebs.” A letter addressed, with an almost tremulous sense of intrusion, to Brassey’s office, had been forwarded to Walter, a letter breathing the old affection and admiration. Walter’s response had been cordial. He would like to see old Ned again, he thought, and remembered his queer friend’s simple worship with a keen pleasure, glad of the opportunity to show that not even the first intoxicating draught of success had dulled his sense of what was due to old acquaintance. He had invited Ned of London, but the latter had put off the visit. His uncle, a surly old curmudgeon, whose one recorded act of age, was old and friendless. He could not leave him to die alone, though desire of his friend’s society and of the wider means for pursuing his favorite studies to be found in London were in his very bones, and underlay every phrase of his letters. “That’s like old Ned,” Walter had remarked. “Queer people there are in the world, to be sure.” At last a black bordered missive arrived, telling of the uncle’s death and of Ned’s immediate intention of coming to town.
</p>
<p>
“It’s the best part of old times to see your face again,” Walter said to him as they sat alone when Ada had left them. “I can’t tell you what you were to me down in that cursed hole — the one creature who understood me, who believe in me.”
</p>
<p>
“I knew you had the stuff in you once you got your chance to fetch it out,” said Ned. “I knew you’d do the trick, and I said so.”
</p>
<p>
“I shan’t forget it, old chap,” said Walter gravely, to which Ned answered with a beaming face:
</p>
<p>
“Pooh! What is there to remember? But don’t be spiteful about the old people, Walter,” he added; “they don’t know much, mayhap, but their hearts are in the right place. They’re rare and proud of you now. If you was to go down there you’d get a welcome.”
</p>
<p>
“I dare say I should,” said Walter drily. “I dare say the old hen and the cat were proud of the Ugly Duckling when he’d blossomed into a swan, and bragged of their acquaintance with him to the rest of the stupid menagerie.”
</p>
<p>
They sat silent for a space, till Ned broke the silence again.
</p>
<p>
“What’s this new book of yours that Mrs. Tickle was talkin’ of to-night?”
</p>
<p>
Walter’s face clouded. “Oh, nothing!” he said. “A rubbishing thing that’ll do me no good. I’d buy it back and burn it if I had the money.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter with it?” asked Ned.
</p>
<p>
“Everything that can be the matter with a book,” answered Walter. “A piece of shabby conventionally. I don’t know how I ever wrote it. It’s a beastly business, literature. There are times when I wish to Heaven I’d never seen a pen.”
</p>
<p>
“Why?” asked Ned, waving away the smoke with a hand, and leaning forward with a look of puzzled interest.
</p>
<p>
“Well, for one thing,” said Walter, speaking slowly between the puffs of his pipe, “a man can’t be honest in it, unless he is a man of private means. No man who gets his living by fiction in England can do his best work, if his novels deal with the life of to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Ned, with his characteristic mingling of humility and desire for knowledge, “you know a lot more about it than I do, of course; but I don’t see as it need be so. Tell me what you mean.”
</p>
<p>
“I mean,” said Walter, “precisely what I say. Take my personal experience. I’ve written one book I’m really proud of — ‘Cobwebs.’ I wrote it with my whole soul, put all the style, all the thought, all the knowledge of the life I was describing, that I possessed, into it. A <em>truer</em> book never got itself written, and it’s not bad as literature. It was rejected by thirty publishers. When it appeared, it made a hit, of a sort. I suppose it was the most talked-of book of its year. Most of the papers spoke well of it, and those which didn’t slated it on the ground of its ‘moral tendency’ — whatever that may mean, I haven’t found out yet And to be slated on that ground is a better advertisement than to be praised on any other. Everybody talekd about it; it made me — gave me my position, such as it is. And it was a failure, financially. I dare say old Brassey managed to do me out of a trifle of my due, but I kept a tight hand on him, and he couldn’t have robbed me of much, and all I’ve received yet comes to under a hundred pounds. Then I got the idea of ‘A Village Comedy.’ It isn’t a bad book, but it’s no more to be compared with ‘Cobwebs’ than I to Hercules.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, what’s the matter with it?” asked Ned.
</p>
<p>
“It’s dishonest. It isn’t true. ‘<em>Campagne de carton, paysons d’opéra bouffe</em>,’ as somebody said of George Sand’s books. There’s no real life in it. <em>Des poncifs faits de chic</em>. One has to go to French to talk about these sort of things. English won’t express them. I wrote it when I was ill and bored — when I felt that I wanted to feel good and innocent, <em>enfin, une échappée vers l’idéal</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“I liked it better than ‘Cobwebs,’” said Ned. “It’s just as true, to my mind, and ever so much pleasanter to read.”
</p>
<p>
“It may be pleasanter,” said Walter, “but it certainly isn’t true.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see why not.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>I</em> see, though. It isn’t as true, because it isn’t as individual as ‘Cobwebs.’ I didn’t feel it while I wrote it. I got two hundred for it, though, and Crossley offered me three thousand a year before, and I’d have seen him at the devil before I’d have written for his approval. I’d been living in a garret for three years on a few shillings a week — I was in training, so to speak. That’s the way to keep a man an artist — keep him poor. Let him once taste popular success and he’s lost.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s a cheerful sort o’ creed,” said Ned.
</p>
<p>
“He’s lost,” repeated Walter. “He’s an’ intellectual prostitute from that moment — if he isn’t a hero. He gets fat and lazy, loses his pluck, takes to writing for the crowd, considers the public taste, sweetens and softens his conceptions. So long as an artist is unknown, he has only himself to please, and it is while a man pleases himself that he does his best work — his only good work, in fact. It <em>may</em> please other people, of course, but if it doesn’t satisfy him it’s nought. Directly he begins to wonder what Smith, Jones, and Robinson, will think of his work he’s done for. See here,” he continued after a pause, “I got that this morning.”
</p>
<p>
He took a letter from his jacket pocket and tossed it across to Ned, It was from the editor of the <em>Metropolitan Magazine</em>, and contained an offer of three hundred pounds for the serial rights of a three-volume story, to appear during the ensuing year.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” asked Ned, “what are you going to say to ‘em?”
</p>
<p>
“I answered them this morning,” said Walter, taking the letter from his friend’s hands and tearing it across and across before throwing it into the grate. “I refused. I’ll do no more of that rubbish. The time has come to make a definite choice. I am going to choose after Hercules his fashion. I started a new book last week, a <em>real</em> book, and I’m going through with it. It won’t be worth three hundred pounds to me all told, nor anything like as much, but I can’t help that. It will be honest work, at least.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Ned, after an interval of silence, “it seems to me you’re leaving out of sight one or two things as ought to be taken into consideration.”
</p>
<p>
“What things am I leaving out of sight?” asked Walter.
</p>
<p>
“If you were all along in the world,” said Ned, “if when you put your hat on you covered all you responsibilities you might have the right to refuse money in order to please yourself. But what about — —”
</p>
<p>
He pointed upwards with the stem of his pipe to the room where Ada’s light footstep was still audible.
</p>
<p>
“She must take her chance,” said Walter, “as I do. We’ve both been through the mill already. It will never be so bad as that again; or, if it is, so much the worse for both of us.”
</p>
<p>
He fell silent again, and he and his companion smoked for some minutes without a word. Suddenly Walter spoke.
</p>
<p>
“I say, Ned, I’ve got an idea. How would you like to be my amanuensis?”
</p>
<p>
“Eh?” ejaculated Ned feebly.
</p>
<p>
“My amanuensis,” repeated Walter. “I do so hate the physical labour of writing. You write a devilish good hand, and I could talk my stuff to you. It wouldn’t be like showing one’s mentle machinery to a stranger. What do you say? I shall only want you in the mornings. You would have all the rest of the day for your own work, and I’d give you — let me see, I’d give you three pounds a week.”
</p>
<p>
“Three pounds a week!” Ned sat gasping at the suriferous vision, but a sudden reflection brought a shadow to his face. “What about my reading? There’s no library down here.”
</p>
<p>
“Subscribe to the London Library,” said Walter. “I’ll do that for you. You’ll get most of the books you want there, and you can get the rest when we go back to town.”
</p>
<p>
Three pounds a week, plenty of time for reading, and to be the confidential companion of Walter Monteith! Ned’s face settled to an expression of grave beatitude.
</p>
<p>
“If you think I can be any use to you,” he began.
</p>
<p>
“My dear boy, you can be all the use in the world. I often feel the need of another intelligence to rub against — a chopping-block of some sort. Ada’s the dearest girl in the world, but — well, she’s not very clever. Come! Is it a bargain?”
</p>
<p>
“A bargain!” Ned repeated. He sprang from his chair and gripped his friend’s hand. “By Gad, Walter,” he said, with a solemn happiness of worship in his face, “I wouldn’t swap berths with the Prince of Wales!”
</p>

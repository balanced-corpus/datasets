That I am alive to this day and fit to write this tale, I owe to William Baillie. He saw me fall and the press close over me,
and, though hard beset himself, he made one effort for my salvation. “Mathy,” he cried, “and Tam and Andra, look after your man
and get him up,” and then once more he was at death-grips. They obeyed his bidding as well as they might, and made a little ring
in the centre around me, defending me with their weapons. Then they entwined us and lifted me, senseless as I was, to the light
and air. As for Kennedy, he was heavy and florid, and his life had gone from him at the first overthrow.
</p>
<p>
I do not know well how I was got from the fray. I think I would have been killed, had not the Ruth vens, whose best men were
wounded, given way a little after. Their trick of surrounding the enemy, by spreading wide their wings, was not wise and met
with sorry success. For it left their middle so weak, that when Kennedy and the valiant Earl had been mastered, there remained
no resistance. So when my friends made haste to push with me to the back they found their path none so hard. And after all that
there was nothing but confusion and rout, the one side fleeing with their wounded, the other making no effort to pursue, but
remaining to rest and heal their hurts.
</p>
<p>
As I have said, I was unconscious for some time, and when I revived I was given a sleeping draught of the gipsies’ own making.
It put me into a profound slumber, so that I slept for the rest of the day and night and well on to the next morning. When I
awoke I was in a rough cart drawn by two little horses, in the centre of the troop who were hurrying westward. I felt my body
with care and found that I was whole and well. A noise still hummed in my head and my eyes were not very clear, as indeed was
natural after the fray of the day before. But I had no sore hurt, only little flesh scratches, which twinged at the time, but
would soon be healed.
</p>
<p>
But if this was my case it was not that of the rest of the band. The battle had been like all such gipsy fights—very terrible
and bloody, but with no great roll of dead. Indeed, on our side we had not lost a man, and of the enemy Kennedy alone had died,
who, being a big man and a full-blooded, had been suffocated in his fall by the throng above him. It was just by little that I
had escaped the same fate, for we two at the time had been in death-grips, and had I not been thin and hardy of frame, I should
have perished there and then. But the wounds were so terrible on both sides that it scarce seemed possible that many could ever
recover. Yet I heard, in after days, that not one died as a result of that day’s encounter. Even the Earl of Hell and his
daughter Jean recovered of their wounds and wandered through the country for many years. But the sight of the folk around me on
the march was very terrible. One man limped along with a great gash in his thigh in which I could have placed my open hand.
Another had three fingers shorn off, and carried his maimed and bandaged hand piteously. Still a third lay in the cart with a
breast wound which gaped at every breath, and seemed certain ere long to bring death. Yet of such strength and hardihood was
this extraordinary people that they made light of such wounds, and swore they would be healed in three weeks’ time. Perhaps
this tenacity of life is due in some part to their excellent doctoring, for it is certain that these folk have great skill in
medicaments, and with herb-concoctions, and I know not what else, will often perform wondrous cures. I have my own case as an
instance—where first I was restored from a high fever by their skill, and, second, from a fit of suffocation far more deadly.
</p>
<p>
The storms of the day before had passed and a light frost set in which made the air clear and sharp and the countryside plain
even to the distances. We were passing under the great mass of Tintock—a high, hump-backed hill which rises sheer from the
level land and stands like a mighty sentinel o’er the upper Clyde valley. We travelled slow, for the wounded were not fit to
bear much speed, and many of the folk walked to suffer the horses to be yoked to the carts. After a little I espied the captain
walking at the side, with his shoulder and cheeks bandaged, but as erect and haughty as ever. Seeing that I was awake, he came
over beside me and asked very kindly after my health. His tenderness toward me was as great as if I had been his son or nearest
blood-kin. When I told him that I was well and would get down and walk beside him, he said that that would be a most unbecoming
thing and would never do, but that he would have a horse brought me from the back. So a horse was brought, an excellent black,
with white on its fetlocks, and I mounted; and despite some little stiffness, found it much to my liking.
</p>
<p>
He told of the end of the battle and all the details of its course. He was in the highest spirits, for though his folk were
sore wounded, they had yet beaten their foes and sent them off in a worse plight than themselves. Above all he was full of a
childish vanity in his own prowess. “Saw you that muckle hullion, Kennedy, Master Burnet? I gied him some gey licks, but I
never could win near eneuch to him for his muckle airm. You grippit him weel and he’ll no bother us mair. His ain folk ‘ll keep
quiet eneuch aboot the affair, I’ll warrant, so we may look to hear naething mair aboot it. I’m thinkin’, tae, that the
Yerl ‘ll no seek to come back my gate again. I tried to mak him fecht like a gentleman, but faith, he wadna dae’t. He just
keepit cuttin’ at my shanks till I was fair wild, and telled some o’ our ain folk to tak the legs frae the body wi’ a
scythe-stick. I haena seen a fecht like it since that at the Romanno Brig fifteen years syne, atween the Faas and the Shawes,
when they were gaun frae Haddington to Harestane. Our folk wad hae been in’t if they hadna come’t up ower late and juist seen
the end o’t.”
</p>
<p>
“And will you have no farther trouble about the matter?” I asked. “If the justice gets word of it will you not suffer?”
</p>
<p>
“Na, na,” he said, with conviction, “nae fear. Thae things dinna come to the lugs o’ the law. We didna dae ony hairm except to
oorsels, and there’s nane o’ us killed save Kennedy whae dee’d a naitural death, so there can be nae word aboot that. Forbye,
how’s the law to grip us?” And he turned on me a face full of roguish mirth which looked oddly between the bandages. “If they
heard we were at Biggar Moss yae day and cam after us, afore the morn we wad be in the Douglas Muirs or the Ettrick Hills.
We’re kittle cattle to fash wi’. We gang slow for ordinar, but when aucht presses we can flee like a flock o’ stirlins.”
</p>
<p>
“Then where are you going?” I asked.
</p>
<p>
“Where, but to Lanerick,” he said. “There’s a fair comes on there Monday three days, and the muir is grand beddin’. I didna
ask your will on the maitter, for I kenned a’ places the noo were muckle the same to ye, provided they were safe and no ower
far away frae the wast country.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s true enough,” I said, thinking sadly of Marjory and my miserable plight. I had not told Baillie anything of my story,
for I did not care to commit it to such ears. But I was glad that we travelled in this airt, for I had still in my heart a wild
hope that by some fortunate chance I should be in time to save my love.
</p>
<p>
About midday we came to Lanark Moor, where the baggage and shelties, as well as most of the women and children, were left behind
to find an encampment. As for us, we pushed on to the town to see what was doing and hear some news of the countryside. I had
no fear of detection, for in my new guise I passed for the veriest gipsy in the land. I was still clothed in my suit of
crimson, but the fight had made it torn in many places, and all smirched with mire and bog water. Also, my face was not only
stained with the captain’s dye, but the storms and dust of the encounter had deepened its colour to the likeness of an Ethiop.
I had not a rag left of gentility, save maybe the sword which still swung at my side. In this fashion I rode by Baillie’s elbow
in a mood neither glad nor sad, but sunk in a sort of dogged carelessness. The entrance to the town was down a steep path from
the moor, for the place is built above the gorge of Clyde, yet something lower than the surrounding moorlands. Far on all sides
I had a view of the wide landscape, from the rugged high hills of Tweeddale and the upper Clyde to the lowlands in the west
which stretch to Glasgow and the sea.
</p>
<p>
But when we came to the town there was a great to-do, men running about briskly and talking to one another, old women and
young gossiping at house and close doors, and the upper windows filled with heads. There was a curious, anxious hum throughout
the air, as if some great news had come or was coming ere long. I forgot for a moment my position and leaned from the saddle
to ask the cause of a man who stood talking to a woman at the causeway side. He looked at me rudely. “What for d’ye want to
ken, ye black-faced tinkler? D’ye think it’ll matter muckle to you what king there is when you’re hangit?” But the woman was
more gracious and deigned to give me some sort of answer. “There’s word o’ news,” she said. “We kenna yet what it is, and some
think ae thing and some anither, but a’ are agreed that it’ll make a gey stramash i’ the land. A man cam ridin’ here an hour
syne and has been closeted wi’ the provost ever since. Honest man, his heid ‘ll be fair turned if there’s onything wrang, for
he’s better at sellin’ tatties than reddin’ the disorders o’ the state.” And then the man by her side bade her hold her peace,
and I rode on without hearing more.
</p>
<p>
By and by we came to the market-place where stands the ancient cross of Lanerick, whereat all proclamations are made for the
Westlands. Straight down from it one looks on the steep braes of Kirkfield bank and the bridge which the Romans built over the
river; and even there the murmur of the great falls in Clyde comes to a man’s ear. The place was thronged with people standing
in excited groups, and the expression on each face was one of expectancy. Folk had come in from the country round as on some
errand of enquiry, and the coats of a few of the soldiery were to be discerned among the rest. But I had no fear of them, for
they were of the lowlands regiment, and had no knowledge of me. The sight of us, and of myself in especial, for Baillie had
changed his garb, caused some little stir in the crowd and many inquisitive looks.
</p>
<p>
The captain came up to me. “There’s dooms little to be dune here,” he cried; “the place is in sic a fever, I canna think what’s
gaun to happen. We may as weel gang back to the muirs and wait till things quiet doun.”
</p>
<p>
“I know not either,” said I, and yet all the time I knew I was lying, for I had some faint guess at the approach of great
tidings, and my heart was beating wildly.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly the crowd parted at the farther end and a man on a wearied grey horse rode up toward the cross. He held a bundle of
papers in his hand, and his face was red with hurry and excitement. “News,” he cried hoarsely, “great news, the greatest and
the best that the land has heard for many a day.” And as the people surged round in a mighty press he waved them back and
dismounted from his horse. Then slowly and painfully he ascended the steps of the cross and leaned for a second against the
shaft to regain his breath. Then he stood forward and cried out in a loud voice that all in the market-place might hear.
“I have ridden post-haste from Edinbro’ with the word, for it came only this morn. James Stewart has fled from the throne, and
William of Orange has landed in the South and is on his way to London. The bloody house has fallen and the troubling of Israel
is at an end.”
</p>
<p>
At that word there went through the people a sound which I shall never forget as long as I live—the sigh of gratitude for a
great deliverance. It was like a passing of a wind through a forest, and more terrible to hear than all the alarums of war. And
then there followed a mighty shout, so loud and long that the roofs trembled, and men tossed bonnets in air and cried aloud and
wept and ran hither and thither like madmen. At last the black cloud of the persecution had lifted from their land, and they
were free to go and tell their kinsmen in hiding that all danger was gone for ever.
</p>
<p>
As for myself, what shall I say? My first feeling was one of utter joy. Once more I was free to go whither I liked, and call
my lands my own. Now I could overmaster my cousin and set out to the saving of my lass. Indeed I, who am a king’s man through
and through, and who sorrowed in after days for this very event, am ashamed to say that my only feeling at the moment was one
of irrepressible gladness. No one, who has not for many months been under the shadow of death, can tell the blessedness of the
release. But even as I joyed, I thought of Marjory, and the thought recalled me to my duty.
</p>
<p>
“Have you a fast horse?” I said to the captain.
</p>
<p>
He looked at me in amazement, for the tidings were nothing to him, and in my face he must have read something of my tale.
</p>
<p>
“You mean—” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes,” said I; “it means that I am now safe, and free to save another. I must be off hot-foot. Will you lend me a horse?”
</p>
<p>
“Take mine,” said he, “it’s at your service, and take my guidwill wi’ ye.” And he dismounted and held out his hand.
</p>
<p>
I mounted and took his in one parting grip. “God bless you, William Baillie, for an honest man and a gentleman,” and I was off
without another word.
</p>
<p>
It must have been a strange thing for the people of Lanark to see me on that day, as they ran hither and thither to tell the
good tidings. For, in all my savage finery, I dashed up the narrow street, scattering folk to the right and left like ducks
from a pond, and paying no heed to a hundred angry threats which rang out behind me. In a little I had gained the moor, and
set my face for Douglasdale and my lady. Smitwood was but ten miles away and the path to it easy. In a short hour I should be
there, and then—ah, then, it could not be otherwise, it must be, that Marjory should be there to greet me, and be the first
to hear my brave news.
</p>
<p>
I passed over the road I had come, and had no time to reflect on the difference in my condition from two hours agone, when
abject and miserable I had plodded along it. Now all my head was in a whirl, and my heart in a storm of throbbing. The horse’s
motion was too slow to keep pace with my thoughts and my desires; and I found me posting on ahead of myself, eager to be at my
goal. In such wild fashion I rode over the low haughlands of Clyde, and forded the river at a deep place where it flowed still
and treacherous among reeds, never heeding, but swimming my horse across, though I had enough to do to land on the other side.
Then on through the benty moorlands of Douglas-side and past the great wood of the Douglas Castle. My whole nature was centred
in one great desire of meeting, and yet even in my longing I had a deadly suspicion that all might not be well—that I had come
too late.
</p>
<p>
Then I saw the trees and the old house of Smitwood lying solemn among its meadows. I quickened my horse to fresh exertion. Like
a whirlwind he went up the avenue, making the soft turf fly beneath his heels. Then with a start I drew him up at the door and
cried loudly for admittance.
</p>
<p>
Master Veitch came out with a startled face and looked upon me with surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Is Marjory within?” I cried, “Marjory! Quick, tell me!”
</p>
<p>
“Marjory,” he replied, and fell back with a white face. “Do you seek Marjory? She left here two days agone to go to you, when
you sent for her. Your servant Nicol went after her.”
</p>
<p>
“O my God,” I cried, “I am too late;” and I leaned against my horse in despair.

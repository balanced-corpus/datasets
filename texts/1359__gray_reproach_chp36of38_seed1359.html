<!-- chapter title: face to face -->

<p>Bright visions passed before Gervase Rickman’s mental gaze as he drove from the station in the chilly dusk, dreams in which love played a great part, but ambition a greater.</p>

<p>In winning Alice he had won the desire of his heart, a desire that would never have grown to such mighty proportions but for the difficulties which hedged it round. The wedding-day was so near now, that something of the coolness of certainty pervaded his thoughts of it ; he had even got so far as to pity himself with a pity tinctured by self-commendation for the sacrifices his approaching marriage involved. He knew that he ought to look higher than Alice Lingard now ; personally she was all that even his wife should be, but, although her family was superior to his, she brought him no aristocratic connections, such as he needed. The marriage might even hinder him from strengthening such connections as he had already formed, while, as for her little fortune, which had once been so desirable an object to him, it would scarcely make any difference to a man whose successful financial operations were daily assuming grander, though more perilous proportions. His marriage was, indeed, a most virtuous act. Alice was not so young as she had been ; life had taken the freshness from her beauty, such as it was, and stamped her features with an indelible record. Yet he well knew that beauty had never been her greatest charm, but rather an inward something, which, when it touched men’s hearts, bound them to her with irresistible force ; a certain air about her, a way of moving, smiling, speaking, or being silent, which filled the surrounding atmosphere with grace, and forged adamantine chains about the souls of her lovers. Virtue, in Rickman’s case as in others, would bring its own reward. For a deep, seldom-heard whisper from the very depths of his heart told him that while he clave to Alice he had not quite done with his better nature ; if he let her go, he would part with the last restraints of conscience, a thing, it must be confessed, which is a terrible inconvenience in a career of political ambition.</p>

<p>That ambition, insatiable as it was, nevertheless was in a fair way of being gratified. Scarcely a year had passed since he was returned for Medington, yet he had effected much, especially during the recent battle over the Conservative Reform Bill. In and out of the House he had done yeoman’s service, recognized as such by the leaders of the Opposition. He had been ubiquitous ; attending and speaking at meetings here and meetings there, adding fuel to the fire of political agitation, which at that time blazed fiercely enough, and he had been particularly useful at a bye-election in which his party won a seat. Mrs. Walter Annesley had renewed many of her former aristocratic acquaintances in late years, and had given him excellent introductions of which he had made the best use. He was well adapted for climbing the social ladder ; he had good manners, tact and observation, fluent speech and ready wit, and was absolutely impervious to the impertinence of social superiors, when it suited his purpose, otherwise a person whom it was on the whole wise to respect. He was a brilliant speaker, his voice daily improved, and no amount of labour exhausted him.</p>

<p>Thus, with a long vista of political success opening brightly before him, and the prospect of domestic happiness filling the near distance, Gervase drove up to the door of his father’s house that autumn evening, and, knowing the family habits by heart, went lightly up the stairs to the drawing-room, where he thought to find Alice alone.</p>

<p>When he opened the door and saw her standing with that strange look and despairing gesture in the mingled lights of the fire and the solitary taper, though something in her aspect gave him a shock, he supposed her to be alone ; it was only when she spoke that he made out the dark figure of Edward Annesley confronting her in the dimmer light of the further part of the room.</p>

<p>“Gervase,” Alice said, gazing full upon him without any salutation or preliminary whatever, ” when I told you on the down that day that I had refused Edward Annesley solely because of what you witnessed on the banks of the Doubs six years ago, why did you tell me that I was <em>quite right ?</em> “</p>

<p>These two syllables, which had so often echoed painfully through his conscience, were uttered with so keen an incisiveness that they cut into him like knives. Even his ready resource and iron nerve failed him for the moment, and he stood speechless, looking involuntarily from her to Annesley, as if for a solution of the enigma. The latter returned
his gaze with a stern unbending contempt that failed to sting him in the anæsthesia which paradoxically results from such excessive pain as Alice’s look gave him.</p>

<p>“Why,” continued Alice, with a passionate scorn which told all the more from its contrast with her usual demeanour, ” did you tell me that afternoon on the scene of Paul’s death, that it would be to Edward Annesley’s discredit to reveal what actually occurred ? “</p>

<p>“Discredit,” he returned, recovering his self-command, and taking refuge in a quibble, ” was not the word, if I remember rightly. We are not alone, my dear Alice ; you seem to be a little upset.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with increasing contempt. ” Why,” she continued, ” did you assure me that Edward Annesley loved your sister and had never more than a passing fancy for me ? “</p>

<p>“My dear child, do consider times and places a little. If I told you that, it was doubtless because I believed it. I was not alone in taking that view of the situation.”</p>

<p>“Why,” she went on, ” did you persuade Edward Annesley that I loved his cousin ? “</p>

<p>“I was not alone in that opinion, either,” he replied with a forced smile. ” Captain Annesley,” he added, ” perhaps you will do me the favour of going into another room. Miss Lingard, as you perceive, is not in a condition to receive visitors.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” Edward replied, taking his hat, ” I will choose another time to finish my interview with Miss Lingard. My presence,” he added, with unwonted sarcasm, ” must be excessively embarrassing.”</p>

<p>“No, Captain Annesley,” said Alice, in the same incisive tones, ” you will not leave this room. While you are here, that man, false as he is, dares not deny the truth of what I say.”</p>

<p>Gervase turned very pale, and all the sweetness seemed to vanish out of his life for ever. It was difficult to vanquish this resolute spirit, but he had the gift of knowing when he was beaten. He recognized the hard fact that nothing, not even his strong imperious will, could now win Alice back. He heard, the knell of all his better aspirations in her words.</p>

<p>“Stay, Captain Annesley,” he said quietly, ” since Miss Lingard wishes it ; though lovers’ quarrels are not usually conducted in
public. Perhaps, Alice, I may be permitted to ask why these reproaches are suddenly hurled at me in the presence of a third person ? “</p>

<p>“Because that person has suffered the most from the web of falsehood and intrigue you have been weaving all these years,” she replied.</p>

<p>“And he has come to complain to you,” returned Gervase. “Don’t you think, Annesley, it would have been more manly, to say the least of it, to tax me openly with whatever you have against me? “</p>

<p>“I have taxed you with nothing,” he replied. “I came here with the intention of replying to a question Miss Lingard asked me some years ago, but have not found necessary to do so. I have simply handed her letter which explained all she wished to know.”</p>

<p>“You were in the confidence of both cousins,” continued Alice, ” and you abused the confidence of both. You were in my confidence, and you abused that.”</p>

<p>“By loving you and purposing to make you my wife.”</p>

<p>“Which you will never do,” she replied, drawing a ring from her finger, and giving it to him.</p>

<p>Edward, who, since Gervase’s request to him to leave the room, had been divided between the feeling that the request was reasonable and a desire to protect Alice, whose wish that he should stay showed a certain fear of being alone with a man so treacherous, now decided that the only becoming course for him was to go. He had already reached the door, when Sibyl, who had just been informed of her brother’s arrival, opened it and came in.</p>

<p>“Captain Annesley ! ” she exclaimed, expecting to see Gervase only. ” Oh ! Gervase—Why, what is the matter, Alice ? ” she added.</p>

<p>“Dear Sibyl,” replied Alice, suddenly calming to more than her wonted gentleness, ” we have just had a severe shock. Paul Annesley is not dead.”</p>

<p>“Not dead !” replied Gervase. “Why, I saw him die. Alice, you do not know what you are saying.”</p>

<p>“It is quite true,” added Edward ; ” he was swept out of sight and washed ashore alive. I have seen him. He will probably be in England before long. He has become a Roman Catholic, and entered a religious
order, and a great deal has to be done before he can obtain permission to visit his mother, as he wishes to do.”</p>

<p>Sibyl listened with eager interest, as if her life depended on Edward’s words, and then on a sudden she burst into tears. ” Oh ! Edward,” she sobbed, ” the truth must come out now and your name will be cleared for ever. I always knew that this hour would come.”</p>

<p>“You always believed in me, Sibyl,” Edward replied with a slight quiver in his voice, while taking the hand she frankly offered; “I think I never had a truer friend. I only care really for what my friends think of me.”</p>

<p>Sibyl only smiled her gentle smile in reply, though she did not quickly recover her calm, and Alice looked at them with a strange expression not devoid of reproach.</p>

<p>“This is nonsense,” said Gervase ; ” if Paul Annesley didn’t die, why in the world should he disappear ? “</p>

<p>“He was tired of his life,” Edward replied.</p>

<p>“He thought,” Alice was explaining, ” to make atonement to the friend he had injured—”</p>

<p>“Alice,” interrupted Edward, ” that is our secret, remember, between us two and Mr. Gervase Rickman.”</p>

<p>“It will soon be no secret,” she replied ; ” that is why Paul is coming to England, as he tells me in his letter.”</p>

<p>“The whole story is incredible,” said Gervase impatiently. “Do you mean to say that Paul Annesley is a monk ? He will have some difficulty in proving his identity here. No one who knew him would believe anything so preposterous. Paul of all men in the world to turn monk indeed ! Some monk is humbugging you, Annesley, for the sake of getting the property. Besides,” he added, “no religious order would receive a man without a pension.”</p>

<p>“He was not without money,” Edward explained.” The diamonds we saw at Neufchâtel were in his possession. Altogether he had about a thousand pounds, as well as professional knowledge which would be useful to a friar.”</p>

<p>Yet Rickman believed the story. A letter from Paul alone, and nothing that Edward could have told her, accounted for Alice’s strange behaviour to himself. The superscription of the letter was shown him, and he admitted that it was a good imitation of Paul Annesley’s handwriting.</p>

<p>He then left the room ostensibly to tell the news to his father, who was happily absorbed in his favourite studies and ignorant of all that
was passing.</p>

<p>Edward had yet to break the intelligence to Mrs. Walter Annesley, for she had refused to admit him when he called that afternoon. He hoped to get an interview in the evening, and was hurrying off for the purpose of making another trial.</p>

<p>“I broke my news too roughly,” he said in wishing Alice good-night, for his hard manner to her vanished after her stormy reception of Gervase. ” It was not a pleasant duty, and that spoils the temper,” he explained.</p>

<p>Alice looked down, then she looked up with her eyes clouded with tears. ” I owe it to you,” she faltered, ” to tell you all—how I came to misjudge you. But not now.”</p>

<p>“Some day,” he replied with increasing gentleness, “you shall tell me. When you feel inclined.”</p>

<p>“Alice,” Sibyl asked when he was gone, “what led you to misjudge him? There is some mystery behind this.”</p>

<p>Alice took Sibyl’s bright face in her hands and kissed it with a tenderness that almost surprised her.</p>

<p>“Never ask, Sibyl,” she replied ; ” let me as well as others have the benefit of your loyal trust. You are the best friend <em>I</em> had or ever shall have.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Alice was in the hall, pacing restlessly to and fro, and trying to collect the fragments of her shattered world, when Gervase issued from his father’s study, closing the door behind him, and approaching her.</p>

<p>“I shall return to town at once,” he said, thus relieving her from a great embarrassment; ” I have told my father that I found a telegram awaiting me here.”</p>

<p>“It is plain that we cannot be under the same roof again,” she replied.</p>

<p>“You will never forgive me,” he added gloomily. “Jacob was never forgiven for stealing <em>his</em> blessing, though he got the blessing nevertheless. You asked me why I deceived you, Alice,” he added, his voice deepening and touching her in spite of the loathing with which his perfidy inspired her. ” It was because I loved you with such a love as men seldom feel. I cannot tell when it began —years before either of the Annesleys thought of you; it never faltered — never. You never had and you never will have a more constant and devoted lover—”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush, Gervase ! ” she sobbed, ” do you think I am made of stone ? Were you not my only brother and best friend ? Are you not your mother’s son ? Can you not think what a bitter thing it is to have to think ill of you, to know of your cruel falseness ? “</p>

<p>“No,” he interrupted quickly, ” I cannot ; you are stone in comparison with me. You can never even picture such a passion as mine to yourself, cold, hard, immaculate woman that you are!”</p>

<p>“Gervase ! “</p>

<p>“Listen, Alice,” he said, collecting himself and curbing the fierce passion in his voice. ” You have three lovers, and, woman-like, will probably choose the worst. Of these three, one attempted murder for the love of you ; one lied for your sake, though not for your sake alone, for Sibyl’s happiness was at stake ; and one “—here he smiled a sarcastic smile— ” he who saw and loved you the latest did not think it worth while so much as to clear himself from a dreadful imputation for your sake. Which of these three, think you, loved you the best ? “</p>

<p>“He who loved honour and loyalty more,” replied Alice, proudly, and without hesitation.</p>

<p>“And he proved it when he offered himself to another woman who had the good sense to reject the cold-blooded—”</p>

<p>“Hush, Gervase! things are bitter enough already,” Alice broke in ; ” do not embitter them more by idle words. Let us part in peace.”</p>

<p>“Peace ! ” echoed Gervase, with a scornful laugh. And he looked at the hearth fire in silence awhile.</p>

<p>When he spoke again his mood was altered.</p>

<p>“Alice,” he said gently, ” do not let Sibyl despise me.”</p>

<p>“I will tell lier nothing that I can avoid to your discredit, Gervase,” she replied.</p>

<p>“I have said nothing? of breaking off our engagement yet. Put it as you please, but no not break with them, if you can help it. I hope you will not leave them ; my father ages visibly. We might part with a mutual conviction that we were unsuited to each other,” he added with a sardonic smile.</p>

<p>So they agreed, and then Rickman’s carriage drove up, and Mr. Rickman and Sibyl came into the hall to see him off.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Alice,” he said, in his usual quiet manner, when he had parted with his father and sister.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” she replied, in a faint far-off voice.</p>

<p>She stood on the steps and watched the carriage till its lights diminished to points, and were finally swallowed up in the dense dark night ; while Gervase looked back at the graceful figure standing in the fan-shaped light streaming from the open hall, till the bend of the road swept it from him, and his heart ached with a heavy despair.</p>

<p>Ambition, wealth, success, power—all was now nothing without Alice.</p>

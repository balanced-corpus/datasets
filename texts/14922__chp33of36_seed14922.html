<!-- CHAPTER XIV.<br>THE PARACHUTE. -->
<p>
Some minutes after the late terrible scene between Kaddour and his old tormentors, Virgil took provisions to them, and reassured the unfortunate men with the intelligence that the only penalty inflicted on them was to fetch the chlorate back from the bottom of the crater of Rheticus.
</p>
<p>
They did this with such alacrity that the chlorate was all restored within twelve hours, although this entailed enlarging the orifice of the crater, going down it, and filling their sacks to take them to the observatory twenty-seven times in succession. The fabrication of oxygen now proceeded rapidly, whilst the machines were set going to charge the electro-accumulators. At the expiration of forty-eight hours, the time fixed by Norbert, the preparations were completed. The young savant announced the welcome fact at breakfast-time, and then proceeded quite calmly to establish contact.
</p>
<p>
“Now we start,” he said, looking at his chronometer, and making a note in his pocket-book. “We shall arrive in a hundred and fifty-five hours and eight minutes, not counting the seconds.”
</p>
<p>
“Arrive where?” asked Gertrude.
</p>
<p>
“In the Soudan. I had a motive yesterday in hurrying matters so. The position of the Earth at this moment is such that we have every chance of descending on the desert of Bayouda. Had I waited one hour longer, we should have fallen on Bengal or Cochin China. It was, you see, advisable to make as much haste as possible!”
</p>
<p>
“If you had asked me,” said Gertrude, pouting a little, “I would have preferred descending at Khartoum!”
</p>
<p>
“Believe me, I should have been only too delighted to please you in that respect,” murmured Norbert, “but there was one great difficulty in the way.”
</p>
<p>
“What was that?”
</p>
<p>
“We should have had to wait seventeen years longer!”
</p>
<p>
Every one laughed on hearing this, not excepting Gertrude herself.
</p>
<p>
“And if some accident,” pursued Norbert, “should have prevented our departure at the precise minute, the long delay would have been perfectly useless.”
</p>
<p>
Life in the observatory went on the same as before, and it was difficult to believe that they had changed place. Only their implicit reliance on the calculations of the young astronomer led them to place faith in his assurances that they had really started. Before retiring to rest, however, they perceived a sensible difference in the diameter of the Earth, now in her last quarter; and Norbert confirmed by micrometrical measurements the fact of her increased size.
</p>
<p>
Thenceforward there was not the shadow of a doubt: drawn by an irresistible force, the lunar globe was for the second time advancing to meet the terrestrial globe!
</p>
<p>
Virgil good-naturedly announced the fact to the prisoners when he took them their food; but to his great surprise they appeared actually discomfited at the news.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t understand the blackguards!” he muttered as he left the prison.
</p>
<p>
“What do you say, Virgil?” asked Gertrude, who overheard him.
</p>
<p>
“I say there is no means of satisfying the prisoners, do what one will! You know how kind I have been to them, according to master’s orders. They have had wine, beer, rum, coffee, biscuits, everything they wish for; and still they are not contented.”
</p>
<p>
“It is because they have not the one thing they value, liberty,” said Gertrude, laughing.
</p>
<p>
“Why did they abuse the liberty they had, then by plotting against master, who is a thousand times too good to them? How, think you, do they thank him for it all? By refusing to believe that he intends to take them back to Earth: they persist in asserting that he will find some way of leaving them on the Moon!”
</p>
<p>
“How base!” cried Gertrude. “What wicked men!”
</p>
<p>
“I must confess that I am sometimes tempted to let them believe it: it is a good punishment for them.”
</p>
<p>
“No! that is cruel, Virgil. But they are, indeed, base not to believe in the good faith of M. Mauny, when he has given them so many proofs of it.”
</p>
<p>
“They judge him according to themselves, you see, Mademoiselle: they are three villainous rogues!”
</p>
<p>
When Norbert heard this, he thought it right to go himself and reassure the prisoners.
</p>
<p>
“I hear,” he said to them, ” that you think me capable of leaving you here. You misjudge me, and you do not seem to appreciate the sacrifice I made in sparing you, instead of leaving Nature to do her work at that time when oxygen was so invaluable! But do not suppose that you are to escape scot-free for all that. I spared your lives, not in order to abandon you, but that I may deliver you up to justice as soon as we reach the Earth. Make yourselves happy on the point, then. You shall return to the Soudan with me, but I do not promise you golden hours there. You shall return, however, without fail.”
</p>
<p>
The prisoners listened to these words in a gloomy silence, and for some little time they were quieter. But they still had their suspicions, especially of Virgil. At last no one took any further notice of their fancies, for they saw everything in the light of their own jaundiced minds, and it was hopeless to try and undeceive them.
</p>
<p>
The descent proceeded rapidly. Seventy hours after starting, the Earth visibly increased in diameter, appearing like a large ball of a uniform colour, on which the continents stood out distinctly, and were of a yellow hue, whilst the seas were steel gray. The rotation was so plainly evident that the different regions of the globe made each their separate entry at the eastern side of the disk, passed like light clouds over its face, and disappeared on the other side.
</p>
<p>
“It reminds one of the figures in a magic-lantern,” said Gertrude, ” making their appearance to the right and their exit at the left corner.”
</p>
<p>
It was in truth a fairy-like scene. Through the telescope they could plainly discern mountain and forest, snow tipping the summits and clothing the Polar regions; whilst a line no thicker than a hair was guessed to be the Mississippi or the Amazon, and a black speck every here and there was evidently some large town.
</p>
<p>
London was easily recognized by her position and her shape. She appeared as a brown spot, about as large as an insect’s wing.
</p>
<p>
It was not long, however, before these details were hidden from sight by a band of thick clouds, massed together, doubtless owing to the increased lunar attraction.
</p>
<p>
The terrestrial globe presented the same appearance as before, growing visibly larger; only she was now enveloped in a thick floating mist.
</p>
<p>
Towards the hundred and twentieth hour, which corresponds to the fifth day, the interposition of the Earth between the Sun and the Moon was sufficiently marked to bring on a night of seven hours. It could not be called an <em>eclipse</em>, for it was not a partial nor an instantaneous occultation of the solar disk, but her total disappearance behind a gigantic screen across all one side of the horizon.
</p>
<p>
When the Sun reappeared, the clouds obscuring the Earth parted for an instant, and Norbert distinctly saw through the telescope a sea covered with vessels. It was the Mediterranean. The waters were so limpid that they did not hide the conformation even of the ground intervening between Sicily, Sardinia, and Tripoli. Then the clouds closed again and the scene disappeared.
</p>
<p>
The final moment was approaching, and it was time to put the last touches to their preparations. Aided by the doctor, Virgil, and Kaddour, Norbert began by fitting the parachute on a large iron frame that had stood ready for the past eighteen days in the middle of the esplanade. It was shaped like a triumphal arch, and bore in front a steel arm that turned freely on two well-greased hinges. From the arm hung the cord that suspended the parachute, and a small electric cable was wound round the latter, having direct communication with the central organ of the magnetic mechanism. Within arm’s length hung a chopping knife in its sheath, and by pressing a spring, this knife would cut the cord and electric cable clean through. This would, at one and the same time, set the parachute free, and arrest the magnetic action of Tehbali.
</p>
<p>
No one but Norbert knew the secret of this machinery, and he fully intended to keep it to himself, and leave nothing this time to chance. The parachute was thirty yards across. It was made of the pieces of silk prepared in the store-room, and pieced together by Gertrude and Fatima under Norbert’s superintendence. The cords of suspension were passed through a large hole in the centre, and it was held open by a steel frame like that of an umbrella. It was so made that it could be taken to pieces when the parachute should have reached an atmosphere sufficiently dense to keep it wide open without assistance.
</p>
<p>
The car was hung by silken cords to the edge of the parachute, and was made of a slight circular framework two yards in diameter. Round this was a silk netting at elbow level, with eleven spaces left for the oxygen respirators that were subsequently to serve also for seats. A basket of provisions, a box of clothing, an aneroid barometer, and a thermometer completed the contents of the car. Above it, passed through pulleys, hung the suspension cable in such a position as would admit of its being cut with perfect ease, as we mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
The whole machine, as it stood there fifteen inches high, looked like a clock, and was perfectly subject to its main-spring — the steel arm.
</p>
<p>
The parachute had been ready for two or three hours, when the Sun disappeared anew behind the terrestrial screen, and deep night prevailed in that part of the esplanade where the travellers were assembled. It was darker than any night they had ever seen, for not only was there not the slightest gleam of starlight, but the sky itself was completely gone: its place was occupied by the terrestrial globe. It was the darkness and silence of a dead world.
</p>
<p>
Seated round a table, on which burnt an electric lamp, in the observatory drawing-room, the castaways were silently awaiting Norbert’s signal for departure. Intense emotion filled each heart, for they felt that the supreme moment had come which was to bring with it salvation or death.
</p>
<p>
On a sudden Norbert rose, and turning to Gertrude, said,—
</p>
<p>
“It is time — We have been a hundred and fifty-four hours <em>en route</em>. In thirty-eight minutes we shall be on the Earth. It is time to seat ourselves in the car of the parachute.”
</p>
<p>
“I am ready,” answered Gertrude, rising at once. “Come, Fatima!”
</p>
<p>
Taking each their respirator, led by the doctor, they went out to the esplanade, and took their seats in the car of the parachute. Norbert, who had accompanied them, returned to hurry Sir Bucephalus and Tyrrel.
</p>
<p>
“There is no time to lose,” he added. “I have just ascertained that the parachute is already considerably out of the vertical position. In a quarter of an hour at most, all must be finished! Do you and Tyrrel take your places. Virgil, Kaddour, and I, will go and get the prisoners.”
</p>
<p>
The baronet and his model domestic hastened to the esplanade, whilst Norbert proceeded towards the storeroom to choose out some respirators for the prisoners.
</p>
<p>
He had just reached the circular passage, holding his electric lamp, when a sharp blow on his right shoulder knocked the lamp out of his hand, and two strong arms at the same moment seized him round the waist.
</p>
<p>
“You were going without us, were you? But you shall not!” cried a voice that Norbert recognized as that of Costerus Wagner. He struggled vigorously, and caught a glimpse between whiles of two more figures close at hand.
</p>
<p>
“Kaddour! Virgil! Help!” cried Norbert. “The prisoners have rebelled!”
</p>
<p>
Happily, Kaddour and Virgil were not far off. They saw in the twinkling of an eye what had happened, and each rushed upon his man. Norbert, with the energy of despair, had mastered his assailant, and held him pinned to the ground by one knee on his chest. It was Peter Gryphins.
</p>
<p>
With a well-directed blow in the stomach, Virgil knocked over Costerus, whilst Kaddour, seizing Vogel with his strong arms, soon made him bite the dust.
</p>
<p>
“There they are; all three!” cried Virgil, taking stock of the victory. “Scoundrels! to behave so, just when we are come to liberate you. But how the deuce did they get here?” continued he, looking all round.
</p>
<p>
The electric lamp that had been deposited on the ground threw a ray of light directly on the wall, and made it evident that the stones had been quietly and patiently loosened; so that it needed but a well-directed blow to knock them out and leave a great breach, through which the prisoners must have penetrated into the circular gallery.
</p>
<p>
It was necessary, however, to come to some immediate decision. Had the three victors been armed, there could be little doubt that they would have summarily settled the matter. But as it was, they were at a loss how to turn their victory to account.
</p>
<p>
“If master and Kaddour could manage to hold this villain,” said Virgil, ” I would fetch cords and have them all tightly bound in a trice.”
</p>
<p>
“Quite right,” answered Norbert. “Hand us over your charge, and make haste.”
</p>
<p>
Virgil did as he was bid. Seizing the already halfstrangled Costerus by the neck, he brought him over to Norbert and Kaddour, who gripped hold of him without slackening their grasp of the other two.
</p>
<p>
“Take the lantern with you!” shouted Norbert. “Don’t lose a minute!”
</p>
<p>
Virgil obeyed, and disappeared into the store-house. The prisoners at once struggled madly to escape, but they reckoned without their host, for Kaddour could have easily settled them all.
</p>
<p>
“If you dare to move again, I will choke you,” he said, squeezing their throats, and chuckling horribly. The savage threat had the desired effect: not one dared to move again.
</p>
<p>
Virgil had already returned with a bundle of cords. He cut off several lengths with his pocket-knife, and in a few minutes the three prisoners, strung together in a row like sausages, were placed standing against the wall. The fight had so exhausted them that they said not a word, but submitted silently to their fate.
</p>
<p>
“Quick now, the respirators!” said Norbert. “We will fasten them on their chests, and carry these rascals to the parachute.”
</p>
<p>
“What!” cried Kaddour. “Do you mean to take them after this attempt of theirs?”
</p>
<p>
“Their attempt has nothing to do with the question,” replied Norbert. “These men ought to be judged and sentenced by a regular tribunal. I have vowed that the world shall know what they have done, and I will keep my vow. Come, Virgil, bring the respirators, and let us make an end of it once and for all.”
</p>
<p>
The Algerian sharpshooter obeyed with military promptness, but Kaddour was not going to be silenced.
</p>
<p>
“It is incredible!” he said. “When you have ready to your hand such an easy way of punishing them, how can you take the trouble to drag them down to another tribunal. You shall leave them here. Have they not by this last mean treachery lost all title to your indulgence? Think you, had the tables been turned, that they would have saved you?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not model my conduct on theirs,” replied Norbert coldly. “Not another word, Kaddour; these men are to come with us. It is true that they are vile wretches, the blackest villains ever seen, perhaps. But it shall never be said that I took upon myself to leave them exiled on the Moon, with the inevitable prospect of death from suffocation. They are now harmless, and I am not going to lower myself to their level by doing what you suggest.”
</p>
<p>
Virgil came back with the respirators, and fastening one on each prisoner, put the mouthpiece over their faces.
</p>
<p>
“Take this one first,” said Norbert, pointing to Peter Gryphins.
</p>
<p>
Virgil took him up, but the dwarf did not move.
</p>
<hr>
<!-- A black and white drawing of the scene is including in the original. It is entitled "Making for the car." -->
<p>
“I suppose I must help you, since Kaddour won’t,” said Norbert, stooping down to grasp the legs of the bound man.
</p>
<p>
But the dwarf planted himself at the door, and muttered hoarsely,—
</p>
<p>
“These men shall not go out from here! <em>I will not have it!”</em>
</p>
<p>
“Kaddour, have you lost your senses? I am master here, and these men <em>shall</em> go out.”
</p>
<p>
“Not so, if I can prevent it,” replied the dwarf. 
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean to employ force?” said Norbert.
</p>
<p> 
“Certainly; if it is necessary.” 
</p>
<p>
“Kaddour, I did not expect <em>you</em> to rebel. Have you forgotten our relative positions, and the fidelity you promised me? I am sorry to be obliged to remind you of your protestations. But you are acting in a way that is quite inconsistent with your duty.”
</p>
<p>
This appeal went home, for Kaddour’s eyes filled with tears. But he did not move an inch.
</p>
<p>
Thinking he was perhaps ashamed, Norbert signed to Virgil to take up Peter Gryphins by the shoulders whilst he grasped his feet. But Kaddour would not yield.
</p>
<p>
“It costs me more than I can say to appear ungrateful and to disobey you,” he said sorrowfully. “But it is a settled thing. These men shall not go out from here whilst I live. They belong to me, and I do not feel inclined to give them up to any other tribunal.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the travellers on the esplanade were astonished at the prolonged absence of the others. The doctor’s voice was suddenly heard calling out:—
</p>
<p>
“Are you coming, Mauny? There is no time to dawdle. The parachute is already at an angle of twenty-five degrees.”
</p>
<p>
Norbert looked at his chronometer, and was surprised to find so much time had passed.
</p>
<p>
“We have scarcely seven minutes left,” he said. “Kaddour, in the name of all that is sacred, let us go by; do not oblige us to use force. You are putting us all in danger. Don’t you know that every second is precious? Soon it will be too late. We shall all be lost.”
</p>
<p>
The dwarf folded his arms, and remained motionless.
</p>
<p>
“Go!” he said. “I do not prevent you. But these men shall stay here.”
</p>

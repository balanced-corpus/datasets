<!-- THE MIDNIGHT BELL. -->
<p> The clear, fine, spangled dusk speedily followed the setting of the sun. The night lay
dark upon the sea before we had finished the meal to which we had sat down when the hot crimson
of the luminary was still flushing the heavens to the zenith with a blood-red atmosphere,
against which the trees behind us on the west side of the island showed out black and lovely
with the effect of the rich light between the boughs and the leaves, as though some hand had
studded every interstice with a red-hot ember. The discordant cry of the parrot ceased,
the multitudinous buzzing that had been going on all day came to an end, the melancholy
wailing whistlings that had been answering one another down to sunset were hushed as if by
magic as the last of the brief twilight glimmered off the sky. It was now the cricket’s opportunity,
and from every part of the island there rose up a very storm of bell-like chirruping, mingled
with the sultry horns of the sailing beetles, odd whistlings and strange groanings coming
from heaven knows where, along with the confused croaking of reptiles and the wild snoring
call of the tree-toad. Here and there upon the darkness, in small hovering constellations,
appeared a swarm of fire-flies. In places, these little galaxies of yellow-greenish points
of light seemed to combine with the dust of the stars beyond them, and the eye catching them
on a sudden would be startled for the moment by the fancy of some astral dance up there in
the dark blue obscure, as though a fragment of the milky way had parted from the main body
and was making a night on’t! </p>

<p> The sea-breeze blew languidly, cool with dew, and fragrant with borrowings from the moist
vegetation it breathed over as it floated down to our part of the island from the south and east.
The wash of the light and lipping surf right around was as soft as the voice of a child; the
sea spread out black as ink from the ivory of the beach, touched at wide intervals with the
gleam of phosphorus or the silver wire-like wake, tremulously riding the ripples, dropped by some
particular bright star. The moon would be rising anon, and we waited for her coming; for the
dusk, clear as it was, rendered movement uninviting and even menacing. In fact it was impossible
to tell what creeping thing might squirm to the tread in the darkness that blackened nearly
everything but the sand. We had not, it is true, observed the least hint of snakes about
throughout the day, but if any there were, the night might tempt them forth to walk. The
puff-adder loves to stalk in gloom, and the rattlesnake’s delight is the forest shadow. That
we might not give anything poisonous a chance, we planted our camp-stools in the centre of
the broad tract of sand that flowed fan-shaped to the creek betwixt the herbage, where even
to the starlight it glanced out clear as a ship’s deck, so that anything that stirred upon
it we should instantly perceive. </p>

<p> Happily for me I had a good store of cheroots in my portmanteau. The fragrance of the
tobacco seemed to civilize the island. </p>

<p> “Even with a companion by one’s side,” said Miss Grant, speaking softly, “the loneliness,
now that the dark has come, of such an ocean spot as this terribly oppresses the spirit.
But to be alone—-without hope of escape, without the means perhaps of prolonging life beyond
a little while—-oh, Mr. Musgrave, there are some forms of human suffering of which the world
can never know anything!” </p>

<p> “I should go mad if I were left alone in a place like this, after a bit,” said I;
“imagination would prove too much for me. Even when all’s well I find myself ill-trimmed in
that way. But to be alone here, without a chance, as you say, of escaping—-I protest I would
not give myself long to witness shapes as wild as ever the sailors of Columbus dreamt of,
stalking out of the blackness of that grove yonder; to behold grotesque forms sliding out
of the gloom of the sea into the gleam of the surf to have a look at me; to hear airy voices
syllabling my name—-well, fancy does make horrid fools of us certainly!” </p>

<p>I It might have been the chill of the dew in the dark sea-breeze that blew with a little
moan past us just then that sent a chill through me, but I must own to being possessed by a
wild fit of dejection at that moment also. It did not linger; it was like one of those giddinesses
which come and go, but which whilst on you make you grip anything for support with your eyes shut.
Doubtless it came to me out of the boundless surface of liquid blackness broadening out to
the low stars. I could not see how we were to get away from this island, and the briefest
mental look ahead shrunk up the very soul in one to the prospect of days passing into weeks,
weeks into months, with God knows <i> what </i> in the far end for some newly-arrived people
<i> then </i> to stumble upon as a memorial of nameless human suffering. </p>

<p>Presently the moon arose, throwing up a delicate rosy haze first, then mounting into it
red as a rose, which changed into greenish silver after a brief climb, with an icy sparkling
upon the sea-line just under her, as though the edge of the ocean there were a long single
breaker arching over into foam. </p>

<p> “What is that?” suddenly exclaimed Miss Grant, pointing to the sandy spit that formed a shoulder of the creek. </p>

<p> In the gathering light of the moon it might have passed for a circular mahogany dining-table
that had been stranded by the tide, and that having felt its legs had started on an excursion
inland. I was exceedingly puzzled, and as I could now see to walk, I approached the black object
full of curiosity and wonder; but it was not till I was within ten yards of it that I made
it out a vast turtle, weighing, I dare say, four or five hundred pounds. I knew very little
of the habits of these animals, but I had somewhere read that the creatures are easily frightened,
and so returning to Miss Grant I told her quietly what the thing was. “It will have come to
lay its eggs, I dare say,” said I; “I have often handled a turtle’s egg, but never tasted one.
I believe they are very good eating. Let the thing by all means contribute to our stock of provisions.
Since there is one there will be others, and if I can manage to turn one of them over, I will;
though how to get steaks and soups out of her I’m sure I don’t know, unless we can rig up
some sort of an oven; but even then what are we to boil the meat in?” </p>

<p> “We shall be very poor creatures indeed, Mr. Musgrave,” said she, “if we cannot overcome
difficulties of that kind. The one problem is how to get away from the island. We <i> cannot
</i> stay here, you know.” </p>

<p> The black figure of the turtle crawling steadfastly along the sand, like some gigantic
spider from which a mischievous boy has cut off all but a little bit of its legs, slided
behind the tall grass and disappeared, but I marked which way she went, for I meant to have
her eggs if she laid any. The moonshine on the water was now glorious, and came rippling in
pure silver to the very wash of the surf; the trees rose pale, and the foliage trembled to
the breeze with the sheeny glitter of the South African silver-leaf. Our shadows lay black
as sketches in India ink upon the coral sand. Oh! there was wonder, there was beauty, but
there was terror too in the marvellous gush of haze which swept smoke-like from the bland
planet eclipsing the stars in her vicinity. Distance grew horribly infinite to it, and the
sense of isolation a physical torment. </p>

<p> “If the ruffians had but spared us a boat!” I cried. “We could have provisioned and
watered her for days and days, and sailed in her too without risk on yonder equinoctial
surface. There is nothing for it but to wait, Miss Grant. This is a great sea, steep to our
foreshore, or I am much mistaken. The island is bound to be in some kind of highway, and
to-morrow, pray God, may give us the sight of a ship.” </p>

<p> With this kind of talk we killed some time. The light of the mounting moon was so brilliantly
clear that I could witness every varying expression in my companion’s face as plainly as if
a shining dawn had broken; only that the moonlight gave a spirituality to her beauty which
her charms were perhaps the richer for not discovering by sunlight. When the time arrived
for me to press her to seek rest, I found her reluctant. And small wonder! It was not that
the hammock was uninviting. Indeed, nothing fitter could have been devised for the languid,
dewy warmth of such a tropical night of pale gold-like splendour as this, than the airy couch
that spanned the black pillars of the two silent trees. One thought of what was up <i> above!
</i>—some scaly betailed thing, creeping down the dry bark with a clawing of its armoured
feet like the pattering of a land- crab upon an uncarpeted floor, to awaken one by a cold
pressure of its belly upon one’s brow—-pah! The tropics are a glorious region to read about,
to be sure; but give me an English summer evening dying out—with the lowing of a cow or two,
the chime of a distant church-bell, a drowsy chirp stealing from the shadow of some
sweet-blossomed orchard—-into the delicious repose of night, unbroken by a note louder than
the dim <i>cheep</i> of the grasshopper, or the faint midnight crow of an uneasy cock. Why here, now,
as we sat, if we paused in our speech for a moment, the ear carried even engrossing thought
away to the rickety chorusing of the million crickets; winged things as prickly as a cork
stuck over with needle-points would sail into one’s cheek with a <i>hum</i> that was like a little
trumpet-blast in its way, so near and sudden was the sound of it; the snore of the tree-toad
too awakened an echo as of an innumerable croaking of frogs; and if ever this sultry and unwholesome
concert sank a little, it was only, as it seemed to me, to give one a chance of catching more
distinctly the thin, red-hot-wire-like sing- ing of a mosquito hard by the ear. The fireflies
were wonderfully plentiful. A little cloud of them hovered for nearly ten minutes in front of us,
within arm’s reach almost ; and bright as the moonlit air was, they glittered so sharp and clear,
that I believe had the night been dark they would have shed illumination enough to enable us
to have seen each other’s face by. </p>

<p> Finding Miss Grant reluctant to go to her hammock, I proposed a little stroll along the
glittering beach, and for over an hour, I think, did we measure to and fro some quarter of
a mile of the sparkling shore, pausing often to watch the curl of the little breaker, arching
black against the moon an instant ere seething into foam, or to direct a searching eye seawards
for any inky spot upon the tremulous stream of brilliance, or any pallid shadow in the deep
blue obscure on either hand of the showering moonlight, or to listen to some few brief, flute-like
notes breaking from the inshore forest, or to mark a meteor of magnificence hurling westwards
comet-like, and leaving a white, steam-coloured scar upon the sky long after it had burst
into spangles and vanished. </p>

<p>At last she consented to “turn in.” I dragged a trunk to the hammock to enable her to step
to her swinging bed, and when her head was pillowed I made her snug with a shawl, and then
enveloped her in the floating gauze of the mosquito-net, through which I could see her dark
eyes watching me. The spreading branches of the trees screened her from the moon, but here
and there a ray fell through, and one white beam rested upon the hammock. I doubt if any dream
that ever sweetened man’s rest was more enchanting than the vision of this girl’s face under the
moonlit, gauze-like transparency. Though no vision, indeed, yet it affected me as with the
unreality of one. I could see a smile in her eyes as I raised my hat with a little bow, and
wished her goodnight. One must go to sea for such experiences as this. Name me such a
conjuncture ashore as could produce it. When I stole a peep at her again, the moonbeam had
slipped off her, and the hammock was in gloom. </p>

<p> “I hope nothing will tease you on the sand,” I heard her say. </p>

<p> “I hope not,” I answered, looking at the branches overhead to make sure that the coast was clear up there. </p>

<p> I had now to make my own bed. The boxes were of unequal height, or I should have stowed
them together into a couch. I stretched out a rug to lie upon, brought a small carpetbag
to the head of it to serve as a pillow, drew a mosquito-curtain over me, and lay down, pistols
in pocket within ready grasp, and covered myself with such another rug as I rested on. The dry
sand yielded with a sort of spring in it, and I found it a very tolerable mattress. But I
lay extremely uneasy in my mind however for some time, constantly imagining that something
was stirring on one  side or the other of me. But I was more wearied than I was sensible of,
and presently felt a pleasing sense of drowsiness stealing over me. There was something now
almost soothing to the ear in the myriad chirpings of the crickets, and in the subdued soft
creaming of the surf. Just over my face hovered a swarm of fire-flies, and I watched them
sleepily. The night wind sighing through the trees filled the air with a fountain-like murmuring of rustling leaves. </p>

<p> I was nearly asleep when I started, instantly broad awake, to a peculiar, melodious, but
most melancholy whistling of a bird amid the branches of the tree to whose trunk the head of
Miss Grant’s hammock was attached. What sort of bird it was I cannot say. Maybe it was one of
the species which induced Columbus to believe that there were nightingales in these islands,
when he sat hearkening at sunset to the gush of melodies which came floating out of the foliage
to mingle with the <i>Salves</i> and <i>Aves</i>and the litanies of his crew. The few rich
flute-like notes were plaintive beyond expression. Aroused as I was from my first noddings,
it took a little thinking to collect the quarter whence the piping flowed, and what it was
that made it. Indeed, to open one’s eyes at all upon the bright moonlight, the white sand,
the froth of surf, the ocean washing out black from the steel-like sparkling under the luminary,
was surprise enough after long weeks of waking up to nothing but my coffee-coloured cabin
in the Iron Crown, specially when the whole was blended into a sort of mist-like dimness by
the fold of mosquito-curtain through which I peered. Indeed, if the sad musical pipings from
the boughs overhead had come instead from some creamy-bosomed sea-nymph glimmering out white
as ivory waist high past the foam that was shaling upon the sand, the sight must have occupied
some little time in filling me with astonishment, so magic and unreal did the bird’s awakening
of me make me find the scene; so likely a theatre did the island seem for the wizardry of
the deep, and so qualified was my mind at the instant for the contemplation, without wonder,
of astonishments. </p>

<p> But the song was brief, and after a little my mind came round to its old bearings, and
being now wide awake, after a glance at the hammock, which I observed to hang stirless in
the gloom, I fell to some practical, anxious considerations of our condition; and the current
of thought being set a-flowing ran into twenty different channels. I recalled my first meeting
with Miss Grant, my instinctive hesitation in undertaking to escort her, the bewilderment
her beauty had raised in me, and how, as I believed, nothing but the tender unconscious
pleading of it could have triumphed over my reluctance to embark on this adventure. Then I
mused upon the tragic and distracting incidents of the voyage, and my lonely quarter-deck
walks with my lovely companion. I dared not deny to my own heart that I was already perilously
fond of her. Indeed, had my reason been half imbecile it must have guessed at a growth of
passion in me by a trick of meditating and endeavouring to interpret the meaning of her
behaviour and looks as I could recollect them after passages of conversation and prolonged
association. ‘Twas a time for such a reverie as this, believe me, with her fair and stately
figure airily resting within hail of a whisper from me, and the sweep of the silent sea round
about closing as if to combine us. By Heaven! I thought to myself, though I know my duty,
yet should a time ever come when I must hand her over to my cousin, it will be a bitter parting
for me. Fool that I was to mix my heart up in a business in which I had no concern! If the
forfeiture of her companionship is to be the condition of our escape, will my growing
emotion presently leave me with disposition enough to lift so much as a finger to procure our deliverance? </p>

<p> “Tut!” thought I, with a waft of the mosquito-net at a little dance of fire-flies hovering
over my knees, “it is about time I went to sleep!” </p>

<p> I had scarcely got my head down on the carpet-bag afresh when I was indescribably astonished
by hearing <i>the chimes of a bell</i> rung swiftly. I listened breathlessly for an instant, believing
the notes to be an illusion of my senses, but it was impossible to mistake. No village church
belfry on a Sunday morning ever echoed a clearer summons to the faithful. The ringing suggested
the sort of agitation you notice in the quick, eager pealing of a steamer’s bell rung as a
final warning to passengers to step ashore. It continued without cessation. I sat up, then
clearing myself of the mosquito-net, leapt to my feet. I saw Miss Grant sitting erect in her hammock. </p>

<p> “Oh, Mr. Musgrave, what is that?” she cried. </p>

<p> “It will be some vessel,” I exclaimed, “close aboard the island; perhaps ashore.” </p>

<p> “No; it comes from those trees yonder,” pointing to the little forest. </p>

<p> She threw the net like a veil off her head, sprang from the hammock to the box, and thence
to the ground. “Oh!” she exclaimed, seizing my arm, “what <i>can</i> it be?” </p>

<p> The bell was no longer ringing rapidly; a sexton might now be tolling it. The slow,
punctually-recurring chimes came along like a knell; they then ceased, and all was still.
I paused a little to make sure if possible of the direction whence the sounds proceeded.
On a sudden the ringing started off afresh—-such a reckless, rushing, clattering of noise
that my conviction was there was a madman at large upon the island, and that this was his
way of killing the midnight hours! The whole place seemed distracted by the clamour. Queer
grunts rose out of the grass, hard snoring noises out of the trees, with a universal groaning
of frogs far and near, the hoarse inquiring cries of parrots, whilst you caught a shriller
edge in the shrill minstrelsy of the crickets. The violent ringing of a bell in the dark hours
of the night, even when one is as secure as a safe lodging and all the contrivances of civilization
can make one, is, to say the least, an alarming disturbance. But to hear such a sound in this
lonesome island, apparently amongst the trees yonder where they rose blackest to their topmost
foliage against the moon, when it seemed as sure as sure could be that there was no living
human being within God knows what distance of us, was such a trial to the nerves that I own
to having hung in the wind for a space, amazed almost to a condition of semi-stupefaction. </p>

<p> The tumultuous harum-scarum ringing came to an end, and was succeeded by a melancholy
tolling, as though there were a funeral somewhere under way. Bidding Miss Grant stop where
she was a minute, I ran swiftly—-I was a very nimble runner—-to the head of the creek, whence
in a few moments I had gained the beach on the north side of the island, a part that would
have been hidden to us on the hummock by the forest. The pale golden light of the moon flooded
heaven and ocean, and objects could not have been more visible had the effulgence been of
the noontide. There was no sign of a ship hereabouts. The deep ranged with a bare breast
steeping and soaking to the indigo of the sky; nothing stirred along the platform of sand
that went twisting out of sight in a pearl-like haziness round the bend of the island, veering
westwards. All this time the bell was tolling, and now I could not doubt that it was being
rung in some part of the island, for as at the creek, so here, the chimes appeared to float
directly from the black shadow of the central grove. I returned to Miss Grant, by which time
the sound of the bell had ceased. </p>

<p> “It is no ship,” said I, “be it what else it may.” </p>

<p> “It is a real bell, though,” she exclaimed. </p>

<p> “Ay, real indeed,” said I, “too real for superstition to find a footing on it, though it
is a chilly sort of thing to happen at this hour, amid this wild loneliness too. It needed
to have been but a little less real to have thickened the blood with fancies of an enchanted island.” </p>

<p> We waited, expecting to hear it again, but the ringer had apparently exhausted his merry-making
fit for the time being, and all remained silent, saving the chirp of the crickets and the wash
of the surf, with here and there a sulky croak.  </p>

<p> Had I seen some figure stalking towards us out of the wood, I don’t think, armed as I was,
and free from all superstitious stirrings, that I should have been wanting in courage; but I
confess I hesitated when it came into my head to penetrate the deep ebon shadow of the forest,
and search for the ringer and his bell. In the wide glittering open, with the moon riding high
overhead, a man rendered desperate by such a condition as mine might find heart enough for
any sort of search or encounter; but the wood was as black as the bottom of a well. Here and
there one could just catch sight of a faint oozing of moonshine into the dark blot which the
trees made upon the land and against the sky; but it was easy to guess that one’s entrance
into that heavy obscurity must signify a groping rather than a peering bout. Who or what might
be there, who could say? </p>

<p> “No,” said I; “I’ll not venture it.” </p>

<p> “Venture what?” asked Miss Grant.</p>

<p> “Why,” said I, “I had a mind just now to explore for that bell.” </p>

<p>“You would be mad to do such a thing,” she exclaimed with energy; “indeed I should not
permit it,” and she grasped my arm. “There must be a man in that wood,” she continued, lowering
her voice. “There must be human agency to set that bell going. Perhaps after all the island
<i>is</i> inhabited, and there may be a nest of savages in that forest, who hid themselves on seeing
us, and now dream of scaring us away by ringing a bell. Oh, I wish we <i>could</i> be scared away!”
she continued, as with a shiver she glanced over her shoulder seawards. </p>

<p> I shook my head. “No,” said I, “I’ll swear there are no Indians hereabouts. Had they existence,
we were bound to have met with some signs of them; a canoe—-a wigwam, or whatever else their
dwelling-place may be called—-remains of fires—-relics of feasting. I should like to have a
good look round from the hummock. Will you stay here? I sha’n’t be gone long.” </p>

<p> “Certainly not. I would not be alone for—-” she broke off, whilst she stepped to where
her hat lay and put it on, and I saw the glint of her pistol-barrel in her hand. “It is wicked
to feel nervous,” she exclaimed, “but what could be so unnatural as the sound of a bell here?-—and
then not to be able to imagine what dreadful creatures may be hidden amongst those trees.” </p>

<!—hummock is not to be confused with hammock, both words are used in the original text—!>
<p> We walked to the hummock, thinking much more of the sound of the bell and of the hidden
being that had swung it than of the noisome or venomous objects we might by chance tread upon,
and having gained the elevation, sent many a look round the sea and into the heart of the
little island; but all this side of the ocean was as bare as the northern quarter, whilst
not the faintest movement of dark substance or of black shadow could we see, scrutinizingly
as we gazed, on any part of the land. The night breeze had died away; there was scarce movement
enough of air to breathe cool upon the moistened finger. South and east the ocean stretched,
motionless as a surface of polished black wood, and the languid seething of the near surf was
so delicate that it stole into the air like the moan of breakers leagues distant. We lingered
ten minutes, then returned. </p>

<p> It took me some time to persuade Miss Grant to enter her hammock afresh. I told her that
I would keep watch; that there was really no more reason to be afraid now than there had been
before we heard the bell; that if the bell had been rung with the idea of scaring us, it was
plain that, whatever might be <i>our</i> alarm, we also were held in fear; that if there were Indians
in hiding, treacherously disposed, they were not very likely to arouse us from the sleep in
which they could have stolen upon and murdered or otherwise dealt with us as it pleased them. </p>

<p>“It is a puzzle,” said I, “that we must wait for the daylight to resolve. Meanwhile rest
is necessary to you, and you must please lie down. Trust to my vigilance, and sleep without misgiving.” </p>

<p> Eventually she complied. I made her comfortable as before, carefully enveloped her hammock
with the mosquito-net, then with a look at my pistols to see that all was right with them,
I lighted a cheroot, swigged off a dram of brandy, and fell to pacing the stretch of sand,
sentinel-fashion, close to the hammock, and keeping a bright look-out on the trees beyond, believe me. </p>

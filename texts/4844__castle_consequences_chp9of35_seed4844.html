<!-- CHAPTER 9. <br>ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HILL.-->
<p>A quarter of a century may work wondrous change in a man when his life has been active and varied; and in man himself, as in much of his handiwork, where the material is good, the touch of time is long beneficent.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years had elapsed since the imperfect play of a hair-trigger, whilst it marked the decaying hour of the frivolous, brilliant existence of Carmen Kerr, became the starting event of a new and vigorous career for one David Fargus. His had been on the whole a fine life since then, full of vast horizons, strong emotions, change, adventure, and success — a life of active independence, which had stamped its character of decision and self-reliance upon him.</p>
<p>In his hale middle age, as is mostly the case with people of sound temper, while his body was scarcely past its prime, his mind had but reached its full power. And though he had so resolutely neglected all opportunities of self-cultivation in his youth, his was a mind destined of its innate excellence to profit peculiarly by the improving influence of years and experience: to become, as time went on, riper in genial philosophy, calmer in well-balanced toleration, less self-centred, more indulgent — all qualities which render a man easy and pleasant of access, and increasingly fascinating in intercourse.</p>
<p>There was little of George Kerr left about him; he was emphatically David Fargus — an American first, of aristocratic, unmistakably Southern, even Hispanicized type, something of an eclectic cosmopolitan afterwards. As to figure, lean and erect as the George of old; if less muscular, more wiry. As to bearing, singularly sedate and commanding, yet of courteous, even kindly, address; on the firm, clear-cut features, now accentuated by an existence of unremitting activity, a curious mixture of benevolence and sarcasm; in the eyes a searching, calm look — a warning to all manner of pretence; on the determined, though far from hard mouth, a rare but sympathetic smile. It was undoubtedly the countenance of a man of generous instincts, who has seen and achieved much himself, and learned to appreciate his fellow-men.</p>
<p>His personality, too, had, under his new name, become famous in his adopted country. It was strange how most of his early visions of a congenial life had been fulfilled, and — rare case indeed — looking back on the career of David Fargus, there were but few passages in its adventurous course he would rather not have gone through.</p>
<p>On his first return to the New World, at the time when the Seceders’ resistance to the would-be autocracy of Lincoln was waxing ever fiercer, he was just in the mood to throw himself heart and soul into any great national movement, in the hope of losing, through the diversion of deed and danger, the haunting entity of his former self.</p>
<p>The interest, moreover, of that many-sided question was deep enough in itself to engross a young man of romantic and chivalric tendency, and he naturally ended by attaching himself unreservedly to the Seceders’ cause.</p>
<p>In improvised armies men of great vital power and obvious authority easily come to the front. David Fargus had these qualifications, and had, moreover, not only a practical acquaintance with regular warfare, but already much experience in uncivilized track-beating.</p>
<p>It could not be long before his special value as a leader of men made itself felt among the Confederates, and it was at the head of a corps of these unparalleled Southern Horsemen that he finally acquired the renown which students of military history have learned to associate with the name of Colonel Fargus, Stuart’s lieutenant and <i>alter ego.</i></p>
<p>A shoulder lacerated by a splinter of shell during the masterly retreat of the last day of Gettysburg, and the great scar on the right cheek — the work of a half-warded Federal bayonet in that fatal encounter which saw the last of Stuart’s prowesses — were the sole mementos of his own personal dangers in the course of the three years’ relentless contention. In that, as in all other moves, his luck had been marvellous.</p>
<p>After these fascinating, yet terrible experiences, another epoch had begun in his life, and as an unwearied traveller, a cultivated writer on little-known countries and on wild sport, he acquired some reputation among the community which keeps touch with such matters. “A rolling stone gathers no moss,” so says the proverb: he never made the colossal fortune popularly supposed to be so easily accumulated in the New World. But if not the traditional millionaire, he stood nevertheless, in course of time, possessed of what may be looked upon, measured by the more moderate English standard, as substantial wealth.</p>
<p>But at this period of his vigorous maturity David Fargus, seemingly the most successful of men, with nearly every desire of his hot youth realized, and, according to the common idea, without a care in the world, came suddenly, as it were, to a standstill in his prosperous career, and confessed to himself that it was not enough. His life had no doubt been well employed, but it was one which, for all its enjoyments, intellectual, physical, and social, was bound in the end, as years worked the inevitable change, to fail in satisfying a character like his.</p>
<p>The glory of independence can only shine on solitary lives, and in the absence of those “hostages to fortune” which strong affections have to yield; and, as youth goes by, its brilliancy begins almost inevitably to fade; a sense of isolation spreads apace, overshadowing everything, insensibly but surely, even as the gathering, all-embracing twilight.</p>
<p>In the journey of life the beginning of the third score in a man’s years is to him as the crest of the mountain’s range to the explorer. The ascent may have been arduous, but the traveller was fresh and eager; the day increased in brightness as he went on, the horizon expanded — ahead was the goal, in itself the reward. Once reached, however, there comes a change; though the descent be easier, the wayfarer has lost his keenness; there are, it may be, scenes more beautiful than he has yet beheld, a sky lit, perchance, by more harmonious tints, if more subdued, but at every step the prospect grows restricted, the world is darkening, the lonely wanderer feels his energy slowly but surely give way to a yearning for home and rest.</p>
<p>And David Fargus was now on the reverse side of life. Years and their memories had gathered on his head — not so many, nor yet so heavily, as to bring any foretaste of old age with them, but already enough to make him think more of the past and look less to the future. The change which always comes — and sometimes with curious rapidity — over a man’s views and desires when it strikes home to him that he is done with the ascending portion of his life, had begun to show itself to him in an indefinite but haunting regret for the land of his youth.</p>
<p>True, before this he had now and again felt these eerie longings for the old order of things, kith and kin, and family and home; but then it was only as evanescent day-dreams, born of scent or melody, or fortuitous coincidence of old associations with softer moods, not the persistently recurrent memories that of late he found impossible to dismiss, and which brought with them such disturbing trains of thought and feelings of disappointment, so bitter and illogical in the midst of his prosperous existence.</p>
<p>In a state of unstable equilibrium, be it in the world of mind or of matter, trifling causes may produce great effects. The rolling of a pebble can start an avalanche; an innocent word, under circumstances of doubt and suspicion, may create an irremediable breach.</p>
<p>It was an apparently insignificant phrase which brought David Fargus at this critical stage to a resolution strange in itself and pregnant with great consequences.</p>
<p>On an expedition — connected, it is true, with some important speculation, but undertaken principally with a view to seeking in physical fatigue and mental labour the recovery of his wonted placidity — he was suddenly laid low somewhere out of the civilized beats by a severe fever. His vigorous frame repelled the onslaught with little loss of power, but five nights of bodily anguish left their mark upon him.</p>
<p>The first time he found himself again in “a city,” where he could confront a looking-glass, he was startled to notice sundry flashes of silver about his temples and moustaches. This was the first obtrusive sign of the advancing age he had been given to speculating about of late — the reality, the inevitable beginning of the end.</p>
<p>Before so very long, then, he must resign himself to being “an old man.” An old man….</p>
<p>Leaning his head on his hand and abstractedly gazing at the keen-featured image before him, he fell into a profound and painful meditation. At the worst of his recent fever bout a rough comrade, who had tended him in that filthy shanty where he lay with faithful, if uncouth, devotion, had one sultry, tempest-threatened night entertained grave doubts of his patient’s recovery. It was in the darkest watch of those interminable hours, the fever-stricken man lay trembling between consciousness and delirium — in that state which is best described as waking nightmare — his pulse at its highest, burning with dry scorching heat; had it not been for the rain at dawn — who knows? — he might now be lying under the red clay in that dreary waste, with a ruggedly-hewn stone, or, perhaps, not even that, to mark the grave of David Fargus. After half an hour’s reflective staring at the twitching fingers, the ceaselessly tossing head, his sick-nurse had removed his pipe and delivered himself of the following remark:</p>
<p>“I reckon, Colonel, if you wish to add a codicil or two to your last will and testament, you had better jot them down at once. Pity your folks ain’t here!” The patient, roused to attention, had smiled grimly to himself at this unvarnished statement of possibility, and while the words recurred again and again as a curious kind of refrain to his feverish cogitations, was conscious of a dreamy self-congratulation at the absence of bemoaning relatives.</p>
<p>Yet somehow the brutal phrase had remained in his mind, and now it came back with a revealing sense of his own absolute loneliness, of his true position with regard to the outer world, that was strangely bitter.</p>
<p>Friends he had in plenty; none very close, yet good ones and true, as men go; but a relative, a being connected to him by Nature’s band, his own flesh and blood — David Fargus, the lonely old bachelor, owned none such on earth. David Fargus? Ah! but George Kerr? He had had kindred. The sturdy young generation, springing from the old tree and spreading far into the land, would have been no doubt something to be proud of now. And nearer and dearer, George Kerr had had a brave little sister; they had loved each other with the tenderness born of childish associations, of the best and purest part of life spent in close comradeship. Poor Susie!</p>
<p>And then there rose a vision of another child-face, a baby-face with great dark eyes and an aureole of yellow hair — a face seen once under the blaze of a Spanish sky, and though resolutely forced into the background of his mind, never forgotten. George Kerr had had a son, bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, his very own, and he had never so much as touched him!</p>
<p>At the end of so many years it was strange how the thought of the child disturbed him. The child? — he must now be a grown man, if he still lived. With a contraction at his heart David Fargus rose and paced the room. After all, what did it matter were he alive or dead? If dead — and so large a percentage of humanity dies in infancy — it was but another fortunate creature spared the evil of existence. If living — Fargus had seen specimens enough of the modern golden youth of Spain: empty-headed, idle-bodied, self-sufficient scions of a worn-out race. What reason had he to expect the boy to have escaped the taint of the life he had himself condemned him to?</p>
<p>Yet the Don had been a fine type of the old school. If he had been spared, he must have made a gentleman of his grandson anyhow, taught him to be upright and brave, faithful and true. And the boy came from a good stock on both sides — who could tell? He might have developed into the sort of man fathers are proud to own.</p>
<p>How idle were these speculations, how needlessly distressing, wearying, profitless! Fargus shook himself and set his strong will to banish the unwelcome subject, and stifle the foolish hankering of nature. He had, of set determination, cut himself irrevocably free from these ties of blood; the past was beyond undoing, and as he had shaped his life, so must it now run its course.</p>
<p>But man, who can rule an empire, has little power to control the small realm of his own brain; he may lead an army of thousands, but he is impotent to quell absolutely a single persistent idea. That night he dreamt of a child of his, and rose more haunted than ever by varying conjectures and vague yearnings. For days he fought with the obsession.</p>
<p>How and when he came definitely to the project of returning to Europe to learn something of the fate of that life born of him, he would have found it difficult to say. But by degrees, the determi nation taking root, he discovered himself, almost with surprise, making actual preparations for departure, and devising various schemes for tracing his relatives, and, perchance, playing the part of beneficent genie in their lives. The thought of breaking his incognito, of replacing by the dead, worthless George the living, successful Fargus, was too repugnant at once to reason and feeling to be entertained a moment. Indeed, it was the certainty of his security that made the whole scheme not only so feasible, but so attractive, in his eyes.</p>
<p>This resolve once come to, a definite object again before him, his trouble of mind disappeared.</p>
<p>With all his old cool practicality, he set to work to concentrate and realize his scattered elements of wealth, and broke up his pied-à-terre in Washington — the only fixed abode he had ever organized, and which his nomadic tastes allowed him to utilize but seldom. And thus, on a certain June morning in 1881, he found himself once more on the way to the old country, and in that state of freedom from ties and trammels which had remained for David Fargus one of the necessities of existence.</p>
<p>During the long course of years following his last journey to Spain, his visits to Europe had been few. A year in Paris; a winter in Petersburg, with a prolonged stay on the estates of a quondam fellow-traveler, great slayer of wolves and bears; a few months in Hungary to enjoy the oft-proffered hospitality of a well-known Hussar Colonel, who in bygone days, when watching for the benefit of the Austrian Staff the doings of the Confederates’ cavalry, had known Fargus’s scouts at work. These visits had taken place at long intervals; but his own native land, and the other country that had had such a powerful influence in the direction of his life, he had avoided, for no more definite reason than some unavowed aversion to saddening, possibly remorseful, associations.</p>
<p>Now, as he stood on the quarter-deck of the Cunarder bound for home, and watched the shores of his adopted country slowly recede and fade into the horizon, the antitheatrical nature of his present errand, compared with his first crossing of the ocean, gave a kind of solemnity to the occasion. How different the spirit in which he was now setting out in mature age — on a venture as uncertain, as mysteriously attractive, as that which had started his second self! Independent, even as he was then, but with the independence of position and fortune, not that of youthful, versatile, self-centring energy; full of vague and pleasant anticipation, as in the far-off days — no longer of the wild unknown nor of ambitious enterprise, but of the softer, occult hope of returning possessed of some power for good, unrecognised, but full of kindliness, among his own.</p>
<p>But as the days rolled by and the proud ship ploughed her way through the salt furrows — every minute, every throb bringing him nearer to his desire — though his interest in the enterprise became more absorbing, the first sanguine glow of expectation gradually faded.</p>
<p>Men who have seen and done much in life remain seldom long sanguine, and David Fargus, while determining his course of action, kept rigidly before his mind the possibility of the unknown son being, after all, dead, or, if alive, unworthy. And he did not allow himself to reckon, save as a pleasant speculation, on the opposite chance.</p>
<p>His scheme was simple, and he anticipated few difficulties which time and money could not easily dissolve; and, unless fate went strangely against him, failure was the most remote of contingencies. The first stage after Liverpool was naturally London; the next, as obviously, Seville, there to pick up the thread of his son’s life and to follow it whithersoever it might lead.</p>
<p>But he had not been in London more than a few days — a delay inevitable for the arrangement of his monetary affairs, and actively spent in settling the same — when one of those strokes of luck which are, after all, more frequent in life than pessimists would have us believe, saved him a long and useless journey.</p>

<!-- CHAPTER X<br/>THE RAIN’S INFLUENCE -->
<p>The next summer Lo and Mona were abroad together. It was lonely for Gasparine, who, however, spent it in hard work. Again and again she attempted to paint <em>the Face</em>, again and again failed of her ideal.</p>
<p>For a few days she found a violent partisan in Lady, until that fair damsel went off to Wemyss Bay for her holidays, with Mrs. Grace.</p>
<p>“I hate when Lo goes without me,” the small one said; “’speshly if she goes with thet eggly ole Mona.”</p>
<p>“But you like Lo to have a good holiday, don’t you, dearie?”</p>
<p>“She could have a beaut’ful holiday with me; an’ I’d show her where to dig cockles.”</p>
<p>“I’m very lonely, too, Lady, since Lo went away.”</p>
<p>“Are you? But you’re big, you see. Big people don’t mind; ’least, Mis’ Grace ses so. Don’ b’lieve ’er quite.”</p>
<p>The end of August saw the Cottage household returned, and Gasparine again joyously visiting. Her love had grown in the lonely summer days, and now, as, bit by bit, she fancied she came into comprehension of this strange nature, she read and re-read those words which she had written to guide her in painting <em>the Face</em>.</p>
<p>“It is much, but it is not enough,” she said. “However, the rest will come.”</p>
<p>And this expectant mood grew upon her into a certainty that hardly left room for surprise, when, on that wild August day, the mad rain wrung the words from Lotus.</p>
<p>It was very wet. Gasparine had finished with school unusually early, because the last week of August, when Miss Blurton took up, was generally an easy one. She had gone direct to the cottage, and, finding that Mrs. Grace and Lady were in Edinburgh, she went up to Lo’s study to await the student’s return.</p>
<p>She had brought with her some examination papers belonging to the new session, and now bent over them with knitted brows. Outside, the wild rain lashed the panes, and shrouded the town and the far hills, giving an indescribable, mist-like green to fields and trees around. Within, the fire crackled on the wide hearth, and, sitting there, Gasparine contrasted the warmth and comfort of the room with the wildness without. On the wall opposite to her, with the flame from the wood fire, and the grey of the rainlight striving upon it, was a large picture of Ladybird. Gasparine fell again to pondering what in the exquisite colouring, and strangely brilliant expression appealed to her like a memory of something unforgettable. Where before had she seen gold hair drawn from a nobly intellectual brow, giving to view the little shell-ears, and curves of the neck, at once piteous and imperious?</p>
<p>She looked and looked, pondering.</p>
<p>Lotus had given her a commission to paint the child, and she was therefore doubly interested in studying the small, defiant face.</p>
<p>Presently the click of the gate sounded, and, on the stair, the quick step. She rose hastily, and, as Lo entered, went towards her, amazed at the strange, wild look, and pale lips.</p>
<p>“Are you not well, dear Lo?”</p>
<p>“Well? Yes, I think so.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Lo! what is it then?”</p>
<p>With her white teeth showing on her lips, Lo shrank away.</p>
<p>“The rain!” she gasped; “the fearful rain!”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s terrible. But—why, Lo!—something has happened to you. You have had a fright!”</p>
<p>“Yes ... it was ... the rain; it is so fearful. It slashed and struck me ... till my breath went, and my very heart turned cold. I tried to think of you ... and this warmth and firelight ... but it was like one dying looking back to life.... Oh, the rain! ... the rain! ... the cold, cruel, dismal rain!”</p>
<p>Gasparine was busy removing the wet boots, cloak, and cap. Lotus talked restlessly.</p>
<p>“I wonder Mrs. Grace has not written or wired. You know she and the child are in Edinburgh for Lady’s winter outfit ... but she certainly should have written. One must not be careless about a boarder, ... it is not right or fair.”</p>
<p>She moved about the room, arranging books and papers, tossing over work—dainty work—for Ladybird, on which she had been busy.</p>
<p>By-and-by she seemed to throw aside this mood, and adopt one unusually cheerful. She rang for lager, lighted a cigarette, and, whistling and chirping about the room, directed Gasparine in her corrections of those examination papers which Miss Blurton, unable to manage herself, had handed over to her governess.</p>
<p>Suddenly, again, the rain seemed to strike her. She stood and watched the branches of a lime tree waving in the wind, and blackening, each minute, against the darkening sky. She turned, and spoke to Gasparine.</p>
<p>“Have you ever thought, while watching the trees tossed in the wind and rain, of the analogy between the anguish of their motions and the hearts that you know? I, as I watch them, see them sway altogether as the world is swayed, by an irresistible force. When they toss wildly, I see so many wringing arms, thrown up in the strife to be free, cast down in the despair of defeat....”</p>
<p>She watched the branches of the lime tree dreamily. Gasparine watched too. For a while there was silence; then Lo spoke again. It seemed the necessity to speak was on her.</p>
<p>“Gasparine, long, long ago, I remember when I was taught, ‘God is love.’ It was my nurse; a good, religious woman. She tried to teach me what she called ‘a happy child’s faith.’ She would say to me, when I shrunk from the dark, and shuddered, ‘Do not fear, darling, it is <em>God’s dark</em>!’ Everything was God’s, and God was my Father. Then I grew older, and I saw God’s earth was—ah, Gasparine! The cries I have heard, are they God’s? The tears I have seen; the wringing hands; the empty breasts. Are they God’s?”</p>
<p>There was no answer to her question. Another long silence came.</p>
<p>Gasparine had no word to say. She waited for Lo, who spoke at last.</p>
<p>“We may suffer much; but remember, <em>the suffering for wrong may come at one stage of development, and realisation of wrong at another</em>. I began to realise my wrong, first, <em>when peace came</em>.”</p>
<p>“Your <em>wrong</em>, Lo?”</p>
<p>“Well, why not? Will you deny me that?”</p>
<p>“Lo, of course not,” Gasparine said, in her serious way. “But how often have you said you had no wrong, no past; that there is no past for any one? Past, present, and future are one ... you said.”</p>
<p>“Said! Said!” returned the other impatiently. “Do we not always try to say the thing we do not believe, and believe the thing we do not say?”</p>
<p>“So, after all, you had a wrong, Lo?”</p>
<p>Lo spoke as if she had not heard.</p>
<p>“I went with some of the girls to gather forget-me-nots. They grew thick in a field among nettles. While gathering them one is stung. Nor have they any fragrance, the forget-me-nots.... It was pretty to see the girls gather; their souls were in the work. As for me, girls and flowers were alike, both pretty to look at, endlessly suggestive of sentiment, and equally unable to sympathise, or heal me. <em>There I realised my wrong</em>. My heart cried and cried, and broke in the soft, evening air, among the little blue flowers, and the affectionate girls—cried and broke alone.”</p>
<p>“Cried and broke alone? Over what, Lo?”</p>
<p>“Over a fair-haired child, that lived once.”</p>
<p>“And who?——” questioned Gasparine, roused by the tone.</p>
<p>“Who, after growing from childhood to womanhood in dumb, mute, suffering torture, realised what had happened to her, and what might be happening now to thousands of others.”</p>
<p>“Lotus, what do you mean?”</p>
<p>“A broken heart; that’s all.”</p>
<p>“Oh Lo! My little Lo! ... <em>Your</em> heart broken!”</p>
<p>“Well, well. What then?” irritably. “Why pity me? What need? I am no better than others. That my heart should break is, surely, no great thing. There are so many breaking hearts!”</p>
<p>“Yes, but, Lo, why did you try to hide what was in your eyes—and on your lips?”</p>
<p>Lo strode across the room, put one foot on a chair, her elbow on her knee, chin in hand, and looked at Gasparine.</p>
<p>“Well, my friend,” she said, in the cynical, self-mocking tone, that always cut Gasparine like a knife, “when you see a woman standing, outside the herd, with an injured air, you may bet your bank account—and that won’t be deadly for you, dear—that the herd has trampled on her some time or other.... A wise woman does not boast of it.”</p>
<p>“Lo, you would stop if you knew how horrible it sounds to me to hear you speak so. I think of you always as something as white——”</p>
<p>“I know, I know,” hurriedly, contemptuously. “Don’t let’s have a repetition of old metaphors.... Snow isn’t in it. Go on.”</p>
<p>“As white,” said Gasparine steadily, “as snow—when it fell, trampled perhaps by busy, thoughtless, careless feet ... but white, to my eyes, Lo, always.”</p>
<p>The great tears stood in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Ah! Then you had better know.... Why should I hide it, after that? I see you are the sort of girl will worship me the more for it.... Then, listen ...”</p>
<p>Lo, too, seemed moved.</p>
<p>Still, Gasparine saw the next words came with a frightful effort, for the white face changed from pallid white to pallid green. At last, contemptuously, the words came.</p>
<p>“One hears so often of wrongs—so often of that ... great wrong.”</p>
<p>Suddenly she bent towards Gasparine. She spoke rapidly and low, her breath came quick, her eyes were terrible.</p>
<p>“A man once ...”</p>
<p>Over Gasparine’s face came a look of indescribable horror. Sometimes, as she listened, she gave a cry.</p>
<p>*    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>“There, do not weep; it is over. I was only a little child, Gasparine—a poor, trembling child, the most helpless creature under the sun.... No, I never believed there was any God after that—no! ...”</p>
<p>*    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>“I was twelve years of age.... That was at the beginning. The servitude lasted four years.... He afterwards married my sister. My three sisters had always treated me badly. My mother and theirs was a guilty woman.... Their father was a wealthy stockbroker.... Mine—it was thrown in my face—an old and disreputable peer.”</p>
<p>In swift, disconnected jerks the words came. Gasparine strained forward and listened, catching the broken thoughts and events, and trying to string them as she heard.</p>
<p>*    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>“Years, years, years! ... long, long years—one, two, three, four.... He was the partner of my mother’s husband. All bowed to him in the house, I, the lowest ... I, the lowest.... He knew about me—that I was sheltered and named for my sisters’ sakes ... my mother dying at my birth.... He knew—he—he—knew—it—would—not—matter. He—knew—they—would—not—care.”</p>
<p>In the last sentence she made a curious pause between each word, so that they dropped, with their full force, like cold and heavy stones into listening water.</p>
<p>“Four years of slavery, torture, secrecy, and mortal terror.... Then, a month before my sister’s marriage, they discovered....” She began to speak with frightful rapidity. “Gasparine, as I speak now, though years have passed, my heart turns cold as death when I remember what I listened to, pretending to sleep, as they came into my room ... that I, their butt and scorn, should have robbed my eldest sister! Note well, <em>they did not blame the man....</em> That night I escaped.... Trembling with ignorance and helplessness, with only the one mad thought, to escape them, I went to him. It was late at night, and wet and dark ... and he ... he was furious with me.... He said I was an idiot not to warn him.... I! I! who knew nothing! He would teach me, he said, to get him into trouble. It was not my first lesson, but, oh! ...”</p>
<p>Suddenly she burst into a laugh so horrid that a thrill of terror beat in Gasparine’s heart.</p>
<p>“Gasparine!” she cried, laughing. “Just imagine! Look at me! Oh, do! Lady-lecturer, so slim! So cared for! See my two hands! Gentle woman’s hands. I know nothing of shame or degradation, do I? There is no mark on the wrists to show where they were tied up!”</p>
<p>She stopped with a jerk, put her closed hands together above her head, staggered, and laughed again.</p>
<p>At the movement, sound, and look, Gasparine fell on her knees, crying aloud.</p>
<p>The sound calmed Lotus’ weird merriment. In an instant she was herself.</p>
<p>“Hush!” she said peremptorily. “I forgot! We can bear more than we can bear to hear of....” Then again, with sudden wildness, incoherently, “Besides, my hair was gold.... I hate gold hair—brown, and dark, and close round one’s face, that hides one somewhat from the eyes that always seem to glare, and peer, and read the brand on one’s brow.” She clenched her hands above her head with a frightful, guttural “Ach!” then went on. “Yes. Then one can forget the other face, with the gold hair drawn back, and nothing to veil it ... nothing to veil it.... And, God help me! you see I was so young, I had been so cruelly tortured—and the years were so long.”</p>
<p>She was silent for a little, struggling for composure, then, sinking beside a chair, she began in a wailing voice.</p>
<p>“And it rained, and rained, and rained. Through all I heard the rain beat on the window.... And when the woman came to take me I felt the rain.... Oh, the rain, the cruel rain! ... I hate the rain! ...</p>
<p>“Yes, that woman was to take me home—back to them. He knew what he did—he knew that he could make <em>his</em> peace.... <em>He knew to what he sent me</em>—I was his sacrifice to their wrath! ...” No cries, no outburst of curses, could have given the frightful impression of these bald words. “Oh, Gasparine! in the quiet of the nights now, I hear my own voice, stifled, crying, promising impossibilities wildly, beseeching, imploring him for mercy—that he would not send me back ... till it is faint, and then I hear again the swift, voiceless breath, whistling, and cutting my chest in the anguish and stress with which it was drawn.... Well, I escaped—no matter how....”</p>
<p>Gasparine looked at the face, then turned in agony from the unspoken horror written there.</p>
<p>“I went to an old servant—she had been my maid, and was dismissed by my sister for stealing. Yes, and more than that I do not know. She was a pretty, fiery, black-eyed girl. She kept me for six months, and never reproached me, though she was sometimes rough, and struck me silent when I was fretful, until she found that morphine quieted me, and then she gave me dose after dose, until my senses almost left me.”</p>
<p>The pallor of Gasparine’s face, and the dry swallowing, touched Lotus.</p>
<p>“Don’t mind,” she said. “It is over, and I have learnt to bear. Listen, and learn what a woman can bear, with not a soul to understand her suffering, not a hand to touch her wound with knowledge. <em>The abomination of desolation!</em> I have known it,” she said. “Yes, in those times I learnt that in all deeds of heroism, love, courage, reform, it is given us, by some eternal law, to have companionship. But the <em>deaths</em> of existence, physical, mental, moral—these we must die alone. In death is no companionship. Loneliness, the horror of it! The absolute loneliness of the soul! Solitude is beautiful, the withdrawing of the soul apart, but loneliness is a horror! That horror I have suffered; that death I have died. And horror does not strengthen the mind. Courage and endurance, yes, by right of their moral worth, but horror, the crushing of the soul by the remorselessness of an evil we have not ourselves power over! that weakens the soul! Well for me it came when I was too young to realise its fullest power and degradation. That piteous passivity of youth is, many a time, the saving of a soul. I could not bear it now....</p>
<p>“For a week before my time a dog howled outside my window horribly, and I used to fancy it waited to take me to hell for my wickedness....</p>
<p>“And when I saw the strange live thing beside me in the bed—a poor, seven-months baby—I hated it, how I hated it! And longed to kill it ... but something kept me back.... I wanted to beat it to death with my hands, but no; for I said, ‘It never hurt me, but if I killed it it would hurt me; its dead face would haunt me.’ Can you imagine a look of reproach on a dead baby’s face? And so I would not; and sometimes when she looks at me now, poor dove, I fancy I see a questioning look on her little face.... And you know she cannot bear a dog to howl.”</p>
<p>Gasparine started, then held herself still. A swift and blinding panorama passed before her. She saw the little fair child standing in the hall, and seeming to listen mysteriously. She saw the young girl in the garden ... the brilliant colour, the golden hair, the listening attitude. And then she saw a little bundle, a red cloak, a bare white arm.</p>
<p>“Oh, mystery of life!” she whispered to herself, remembering what she was then, and the many gates of experience which had unfolded to her since. But she would not interrupt the girl ... her own little red-cloaked dream-girl of long ago.... She listened now more eagerly than ever.</p>
<p>“Then there was another craving in my heart; for when one is a mother one becomes desperate. I said, ‘Nothing matters. But I will go and kill the other woman, my sister. What is life to me? What is the child to me? Perhaps the gnawing in my breast would stop if I might go and kill the woman....’</p>
<p>“I thought it all over, in the first week of the child’s life, in the moments of intense and awful consciousness, sharp and old, which the morphine gave me, between two o’clock and the dawn.... And the same thing fought for the woman as fought for the child.... Something in my heart that said, ‘You know what it is to suffer. Will others’ suffering ease <em>your</em> pain? Look around. Everywhere are men groaning, and bowed to the earth. They, too, perhaps for their sin to you. Will you fill your hands with ashes to lay upon them?’</p>
<p>“Then, with the passing weeks, questions rose in my heart. ‘I will not murder,’ I said, ‘but I will go and see if the great sin she has committed has marked her face, so that men wonder what it is?’ And so, one night, in Rosalie’s absence, I went, with the child. Oh, that journey! the glare, the dust, the hansom bells, the tramp of horses’ feet, the omnibuses, the wailing of the poor, rabbit-like baby! But I was there at last ... faint and trembling, clinging to the railings. I saw <em>their home</em>. It was lighted up. Some festivities were in progress, and I saw my sister pass in the light ... and he, the father of the child I held, stepped, for a moment, into the balcony.</p>
<p>“<em>Then</em> I wanted to kill them both, and the child too, for on their faces was no sign of the sin they had sinned.... She was painted, and, with her jet hair and brown eyes, looked an adorable woman; showing in her low laces, the curved whiteness of the softness that covered her woman’s heart. The treachery of her appearance drove me mad.... Of <em>him</em> I did not think so much. Only the thick red neck, of which, in my best moments, I had always been afraid, roused in me again something of the old terror....</p>
<p>“I looked, and looked, and looked ... and turned away....”</p>
<p>She paused.</p>
<p>Across her colourless cheek went a strange streak of red. Gasparine watched it die away, too choked to speak.</p>
<p>“Day by day the struggling remnants of my youth strove to heal and go forward, in step with the great march of life. No; impossible! I shrank from all humanity with unspeakable dread. I wished only, never to know right or wrong again, only to be wrapped in some warmth that would kill the chill, some kindness that would give me again a place, a level among those who worked and went not knowing depths like mine.... But in my soul revolt was growing, and the calm of my murdered heart was giving me strength.... The child was three months old, and I seventeen, when my intellect roused, and asserted its supremacy. I found, one day, among Rosalie’s belongings—how they got there heaven knows!—an old Latin grammar, and a book of Euclid. Never shall I forget the intense intellectual awakening of that moment! I threw the baby down, and took the books with a flood of old memories over me.... I had been clever as a child, something of a prodigy, indeed, in mathematics and the classics ... but my little triumphs were joyless, for no one cared;—indeed, it was a source of anger with my sisters.</p>
<p>“Now I resolved. I was seized with a great, vague ambition, in which I should be tremendously clever, make a fortune, become world-famous, and avenge myself. The reality has been less gilded, but better on the whole. My first step was to throw away the morphine, my next to beseech Rosalie to help me to a situation. The child was put to nurse, and I became servant in a lodging-house.</p>
<p>“My mistress drank; she was a widow, a lady by birth, once the beauty of her county, now seized by the remorseless passion of drink. She earned a precarious living by keeping lodgers.</p>
<p>“When drunk, she forgot to pay me; otherwise, she was kind.... Then arrived a time when she would not pay me, and Rosalie, destitute, came to upbraid me. Something entered to me that night, and I found what <em>a will</em> can do. I took her brandy-bottle in my hand, and told her my story, asking for my wages regularly....</p>
<p>“Gasparine, look in my eyes; there are no drops of water, but there are tears and tears.... If I could weep for any of that past I would weep here. My death was her life. As she folded me in her arms, the Voice cried to her, ‘Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead....’</p>
<p>“That woman is Mrs. Grace, and <em>now</em> she does not drink. Unfortunately, she cannot become fond of the child.</p>
<p>“‘Let us blot out those years,’ she said. ‘You shall become again a child.’ And so it came out.”</p>
<p>All these words fell with inconceivable rapidity.</p>
<p>“A friend, indeed, a lover, of her early days was Professor of History at Oxford. He still befriended her, and—for you know that undying charm she has about her?—loved her. She told him something, a fictitious, but sufficiently pressing story, about me, and he offered to see me through the University until I took my degree of M.A.</p>
<p>“In my school-girl’s sailor frock I, at seventeen, passed for any age between thirteen and fifteen. At thirteen I was a woman; at seventeen I had the thin air of a little girl who grows out of her frocks.... Three years later I was the University prodigy, when I took my degree.</p>
<p>“At twenty—my real age—I got this post. I was not in reality fit for it, but Professor Raymond worked untiringly to get it for me. The salary was exceptionally high for one thing, the work not heavy, except in considering my age; and the advantage for Mrs. Grace and me to get away to an unknown country! These reasons all weighed with him. Of all his loving help I can speak no thanks, but I can, and do, feel him a king among men, knowing he did it all in tender pity for a woman who once terribly betrayed and scorned him, learning, too late, his worth.</p>
<p>“That is all the story. Ladybird is my daughter. Her hair is gold, like mine was. To hide such likeness as is between us, mine is dyed, and worn like this. Her age, and my supposed age, keep me perfectly safe.... Yes, that is all! ...”</p>
<p>There was a long, long silence. Gasparine’s horror was so great that she remained still and tearless, yet with keen pain. When next Lo spoke it was in a voice of such softness and sweetness that involuntarily Gasparine’s eyes were drawn to her. A piteous sight—the pallid face, the brows bound with restless, long fingers, the eyes looking at the dream of which she spoke.</p>
<p>“I had a dream one night—one night when my heart was very full of its misery. I thought I heard God call me and say, ‘Come into the sunlight, oh! my little child!’ ... (No one had ever called me ‘little child’ before. When I was scarcely more than a baby people seemed to think me old, but, you see, to the great God I was only a little child. There was such <em>rest</em> in the thought!) ‘Come into the sunlight, oh! my little child! My hands hold your face while I search your soul ... and the sunlight is my hands, and the light is my eyes.... Come into the sunlight and be strong.’ But I would not go until”—there came a choking pause—“until God called all who were weary and sorrowful, and born old like me—till He called them also ‘little children,’ and bade them come into the sunlight; and we all went together.”</p>
<p>Gasparine’s heart was wrung. The expression of strife and agony on the loved face was terrible to see. Lotus, with the awful memories crowding upon her, fell into one of her dreamy states.</p>
<p>“Rosalie died,” she said. “Poor Rosalie! Often she tried to persuade me to let her take me to the Halls and get me a sweetheart. ‘Gracious, missy!’ she would say; ‘don’t you worry! Come an’ be ’appy.’ ... I don’t know what kept me back, certainly not a sense of virtue—at least, as far as I knew—for the world was all to me a hideous charnel-house, without love, justice, or mercy. And the only things I feared were the dark and a blow.... (Have you never noticed how hideous it is to me to have to go into the dark, and how I hate to sleep alone?) ... Rosalie died in a Home. She hated it, was full of nervous horror at the cleanness and whiteness of the rooms, and in trembling terror for the gentle Sisters.... Just imagine! That poor woman.... We have not yet fathomed the power of association. I wonder what religionists, socialists, salvationists, make of that? No need to tell us the devils will not get into heaven.... The poor devils! They only ask to be left in peace in hell! When an angel comes, and, for some reason or other, hauls them up for a little into the clean, bare place, they grow terribly nervous and awkward! The gentle sisters oppressed poor Rosalie. She longed to get back to hell. She thought that she was going to get better, but she died, suddenly, one night. I was glad when I heard she had had no time to suffer or to know.”</p>
<p>She paused, and pressed her temples with her fingers, as if holding back the rush of thoughts.</p>
<p>“A sinful woman? Yes. Yet when she died I felt my heart empty as for the loss of a sister.”</p>
<p>The yearning pressed on Gasparine’s heart like a physical weight. She longed to go and kneel at Lo’s feet, and say some word of comfort; but Lo seemed to awake, and, with a slight, imperious motion, stopped her.</p>
<p>“There! Let be!” she said addressing herself, impatiently, and rising, walked once or twice about the room, then threw herself into a chair, legs crossed, arms folded, her head sunk on her chest.</p>
<p>“Well, all this charming experience does not go for nothing,” she said, in cheerfully sardonic tones. “I have learnt many things partially, and one thing thoroughly. <em>Never take the world into your confidence</em>. You must never let the world know the <em>real</em> reasons and motives for your actions. The world is a bad master, but a good slave. Then I found one must either tread or be trodden upon. I do not mean that one need tread brutally, or without relative regard to the capacity of that, or whom, whereon or on whom you tread; but a choice you must make. Study the foibles and follies of your kind, flatter them, and you gain power; but exactly in degree as you throw yourself away for them, staking your soul and life for the benefit of their highest good, so exactly will they use and abuse you. Then I found out, too, the power of indirect influence. Direct influence is nothing. The strong man who floors another in a physical, mental, or moral contest, is nowhere. The world is ruled otherwise. The disciples had no awe of the Christ, but the apostles who heard the disciples had! An opinion, an announcement only becomes powerful when it has passed through several minds; the stream at its source has potential energy, but at its mouth it has power....</p>
<p>“But the last thing I was taught, the truth I fought longest against, most slowly acknowledged as a truth, was <em>that the power of love was dead in me</em>.... How I tried to love! How I tried to rouse some passionate emotion in my heart towards those who were gentle to me! Ah! love, love is better, though in vain, than the emptiness that unlove knows. What did I say to you once long ago?—‘There is no love.’ Let me say now, in gentler mood, the power to love or believe in love is dead in me. I said a great, perfect, unquestioning love would heal me. I knew what I said—I spoke of the impossible! You see the agony was too great ... that wicked and unnatural outrage dried up with damning fire each natural and womanly impulse, turning my child-heart to stone, my mother instincts to gall. Yet when I found I could not love, I found, too, that I could act love irresistibly, and, in return, give patience and gentleness. To all them, ‘distant in humanity,’ to whom my dead hands stretch yearningly, I am, indeed, like one dead. It would seem the very smell of death is on me, so the people draw back.... They are very young and innocent of heart, or very old and wise of head, who love me, save through compulsion, and it is I who feel it most in every gay and lively scene, the awful curse upon me—‘Between them and me a great gulf fixed.’</p>
<p>“Some one has said that no one can be truly dishonoured solely by the action of another. That is wrong. Too, too often the blow that humiliates the body also degrades the soul.... I feel my soul profaned.... I ...”</p>
<p>There was another long silence. Gasparine broke it first.</p>
<p>“In a little I shall know better how to speak to you, Lo. But first let me say just what strikes me most. You are <em>not</em>, in dress or general manner, like one weighed by a terrible past, and whose hopes are done. Lotus, what is there now to prevent you living life as others, and happy? It was terrible, but it is all over. You—you— —”</p>
<p>“The highest law we know prevents it,” Lo said solemnly; “the law of nature. One can outrage the law of nature mentally as well as physically. That is what has been done to me. And do not say that it is past; <em>nothing is ever really past</em>.”</p>
<p>“Lo, may I ask one question?”</p>
<p>“Why, surely; as many as you will.” The mournful voice became sarcastic in an instant. “My narrative has been sketchy, I don’t doubt; but I shall be happy to fill in all details, as you require.”</p>
<p>Not noticing the bitter tone, Gasparine said, gently,—</p>
<p>“Did you love the man, Lo?”</p>
<p>A dangerous gleam crossed the girl’s face. Gasparine saw her question had been a mistake. Yet, with marvellous control, Lotus answered, in a fairly steady voice,—</p>
<p>“No; but at first he flattered, and was very kind to me. That was rare, for I was the butt of my sisters’ spite, and my mother’s husband, keeping me for his credit’s sake, loathed me. He never lost an opportunity to strike or affront me wantonly. I was a sad, passionate, clinging, child. The cloud that hung over me I attributed, at first, to some wickedness within myself. I had a nervous, slavish feeling instilled into me. A threatening look made me cower, the lower that my piteous child’s pride endeavoured to conceal it. <em>He</em> knew this well, and soon taught me to cringe for his occasional kindnesses.... No, I did not love him, but I was proud of his attention, half proud even of his brutalities.... My eyes were wide open to all his faults, yet I did not dare to question why <em>his</em> weaknesses should pass unchallenged, while mine were so severely dealt with....”</p>
<p>The courage with which she spoke these fearful truths against herself was more terrible to Gasparine than any lie she could have uttered. Again the look of dream-anguish crossed her face.</p>
<p>“Born a victim, already, what chance was there for me? ... No chance, no chance! Oh, me! And yet often, oh, often, visions of higher things so torture me that it seems sometimes as if the lost soul of my mother had entered me at birth—when, most unhappy woman! she died—to torture me with her wild longings.... And this dead soul in me seems to say, ‘Oh, give us a chance! Give women a chance! Heavily, heavily a woman is punished when wrong befalls, either through her fault, her weakness, or her, perchance, unwise, but justifiable effort towards freedom.’”</p>
<p>The silence that came now was long. It was late; the rain had stopped; the summer dusk dimmed all outside. Lo roused and stretched her arms above her head, then threw them out as if to throw the agony away. Then she opened the windows, and a thrush across the road gave a final note of adieu. Lo stepped into the balcony, and, seeming forgetful of the recent wild rains, knelt, laying her weary, fevered cheek on the wet, sweet clematis leaves; and, from within, Gasparine heard her whispered moan,—</p>
<p>“Will nothing cool the burning? Will nothing cool the burning?”</p>
<p>The rain dripped from the leaves among her hair.</p>
<p>In a little she returned to the room. She had swept every trace of raging storm from her face; she was again, as always, gentle, smiling, piteous.</p>
<p>“Gasparine,” she said coldly, “I never told any one so much except Mrs. Grace, and <em>then</em> it was not so hard. Why did I tell you? Talk of indirect influence. It was the rain forced me to speak to-day. I fought against it, but the past was on my breast with every raindrop—<em>for it rained just so that night</em>. Nevertheless, I trust you very completely.... But do not consider it a compliment. If I loved you, <em>could</em> love you, these are things I would hide.”</p>
<p>The remark, cruel and uncalled for though it was, only made Gasparine’s heart burst into brighter, fuller flame.</p>
<p>“Lotus!” she said, in a voice full and rich; “oh! my Lotus-flower! Have they cast you out from among the good women, you queen of women, queen though in exile? Only the truest woman-nature could have borne as you have borne. You are as pure as a snowdrop to me, Lotus. Dearly-loved one, I asked for your love—I said that I would heal you till you gave me love—but now I ask your love no longer. Even had you love to give, I am not worthy. To think you are my little red-cloaked girl! Oh! why did fate keep us apart so long? Don’t you know how, in the old stories, the prince in exile has always with him a fool who is faithful?”</p>
<p>“And so you would be my fool—my little fool?”</p>
<p>“Yes; let me be your fool—your fool, who asks only to follow and serve you, whose faithfulness you cannot doubt; for when was the fool ever faithless in the old tales?”</p>
<p>“But I think I cannot let you be my fool. I must give you that compliment. I am surrounded by fools. You, my Genius, are wise.”</p>
<p>“Let it be so; I will take the compliment. In the old tales was not the fool always wise?”</p>

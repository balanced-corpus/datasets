<p>“Such are the lords of the creation.”</p>

<p>” Boxkeeper!” cried Mowbray, his silver voice firm and unruffled; for, whatever he might have felt, the habit of self-possession quickly whispered, that he had no sufficient cause to betray or act upon the feelings which he had endured — “boxkeeper!” he repeated, in a louder voice, when the door of Lady Blankisle’s box was opened, and rendered idle the keeper’s approach.</p>
<p>As Mowbray politely, and not unwillingly, retreated a step, to allow the exit of one or more gay gallant, the Duke of Dublin made his appearance, joyous and laughing as usual, with one hand immersed in the waves of his 
curling hair; which, however, was speedily tendered to Mowbray, with, —</p> 
<p>“My dear fellow, yours is the sweetest voice I have heard to-night. I thought I was hooked, without chance of escape, when I remembered I had something very particular to say. And,” speaking in an under tone, “I 
wish to get behind the scenes, and thought I was planted for the night, and tied to that stick of a marchioness. That’s all; good bye.” And the duke hurried off, like a boy from his school-room.</p>
<p>“Fare thee well, Dublin! your secret is safe,” answered Mowbray aloud, and entered the box, from which some two or three had retreated.</p>
<p>The manœuvring marchioness had resumed her seat in front, and welcomed Mr. MeltondeMowbray with proud, yet flattering condescension, laying, as usual, some stress on the “de,” a monosyllable which she never omitted. Lady Helen bowed with her wonted grace, as those immediately behind her chair partially withdrew, and allowed him to pay his devoirs to the ladies.</p>
<p>The men amongst whom Mowbray now formed one, differed widely from the group into which he had fallen in the pit. We need scarcely say how much he himself was unlike 
those men of the turf from whom he had escaped. In manner the difference was, perhaps, more striking than in dress; for, in this respect, each individual was obliged to pay a certain deference to rules, which brought the whole nearer to a level; and Melton de Mowbray’s style was more peculiar, as denoting the perfect gentleman, than the extravagances of idle fancy. It is true that François, the valet, in glorifying his master’s talents, was wont to tell of certain debates and studies, touching the harmony and propriety of colours; how <i>“di uppare vaistcoat vas nevare vedded to di ondare, vidout asking tree times;”</i> and how, gathering another simile from the same service, <i>“di breaches, di stuckins, and di-di-di — vot you call di ting in di chest? Ah! n’importe, di stuckins and di caleçons. Ah! je me rapelle, di drawers were, like man and di vife, veaved into von.”</i> But, what of this? No man is a hero to his valet, whatever he may be to an author. The effect had all the simplicity of perfection in painting or poetry; it seemed so natural and easy, that every one fancied he could do the same. “What is it,” asked the envious, “that gives Mowbray that distinguished air of fashion?” “And what is it,” asks the English bonnet-maker, in despair, “that gives to the Parisian tie, nay, to the very cut of a riband, a something inimitable and exclusive?” “It is nothing,” answered thousands; and, like the poor milliner, they attempted to imitate, and failed.</p>
<p>Few, indeed, of those who made the attempt could boast the same exquisite materials to work upon; we speak not of the produce of the loom, but of that heavenly masterpiece, created man. Mowbray’s figure was so finely proportioned, so endowed with innate grace, that it seemed to impart a charm not only to all he did, but to all he wore. Genius can effect much, can conquer a thousand difficulties, give the impress of its power to all it touches; but, on the beauty of the substance wrought, must depend the approach to perfection.</p>
<p>We select two of the men nearest to Lady Helen, as forming a singular contrast to Melton de Mowbray, and also as being, in their way, the marked men of the day — Sir Charles Wiffington and Lord Jimmysham. Both were his seniors, particularly the former, who was then in the height of his glory. Both were exquisites of the highest order, and neither of them the fools in their follies for which the profane vulgar gave them credit. There is a wide difference between the want and the misapplication of talent; and, however lamentable it may be to see a man play the fool, no one can play it well who is in reality the character he affects to be. The baronet, we suspect, was the deeper read man of the two, but to a certain point they were both well read and well informed; tact and judgment supplied the rest. With the works of our dramatic authors, from the earliest to the latest, they were both familiar; and, when they could be grave, and talk sense, it was highly amusing to listen to the acute and sensible remarks, the sound or witty criticisms, which mingled with their knowledge of the subject; and, more than all, it was amusing to see the distant back-ground to which their senseless imitators were thrown. In after years Sir Charles Wiffington laid claim to pretensions higher than that of critic, by publishing a tragedy, which walked, if it has not kept, the stage a very respectable number of nights. Whether Lord Jimmysham was too wise or too idle to assume the author, we know not; but, though we have often seen his name in print, it clearly has been against his consent and wishes.</p>
<p>But, to the men: beginning with the elder, we should say, that Sir Charles Wiffington was the most extraordinary, thorough-bred puppy we ever beheld; and, to glance at the younger, he was the best bred man who ever made a puppy of himself. Sir Charles, though not remarkable for height, stood erect, in the pride of youth and expectation; and little did we then dream of meeting the same man in after years, bent double with sorrow, care, and penury — the lingering victim of chancery’s “hope deferred” — the heart-sick prisoner, who pined for rights, restored when the cup of life was poisoned, chilled, and worthless. “Poor Wiffington!” we said, with as honest a sigh as ever was given to a fellow-creature, — “and can that be the same we saw and listened to with boyish wonder and admiration? is that the man whose word was the fiat in fashion — without whose presence the first and brightest circle was incomplete?”</p>
<p>Such were our melancholy reflections, as a friend, pointing to one bowed with sorrow to the earth, and with difficulty taking a weary walk within the rules, said, —”Yonder is Sir Charles Wiffington!”</p>
<p>Reader, forgive us, if one of the living evidences, bearing the chancellor’s seal of misery, and crushed beneath the pressure of its impending weight, has led us from past to present — from the tale of airy nothings to a stern and melancholy truth — a lesson of mortality.</p>
<p>The marked features in Sir Charles were his nose and eyes — both were large and prominent; in other respects, his figure was slight, and not remarkable. Composure, self-possession, and harmony, appeared in word and action; the full dark eyes glided from point to point as leisurely as his feet. There was serenity in his very nose, as it inhaled the perfumes he carried, or breathed the breath of life — not a muscle moved; and as to profane purposes, to which noses are sometimes applied, the idea seemed inadmissible. In dress, there was an <i>outréism</i> which, in all things, passed the extremes of fashion: if the high collar, or “lover’s wings,” worn by the Prince of Wales, were condescendingly patronised, Sir Charles Wiffington’s were worthy of an emperor, and spread, at least, to the tip of his nose; if he sported tight silk pantaloons, they extended so little below the calf, that he looked as if about to slip through them: but, how shall we describe a peculiarity his own — a whole congregation of waistcoats? It is years since we looked upon the sight; but, we think, they must have exceeded in number the capes upon a box-coat — in colours, the glorious rainbow. Amidst them occasionally nestled a “quizzing-glass,” in proportion to the eye, the prominence of which appeared to justify the use of such assistance, though, as the name implies, it was more frequently the plaything of saucy fops; custom has since reconciled us to this useful economy of sight even in the butt end of a whip, which, by the way, is the happiest of inventions for cutting one friend and seeing another. Add cosmetics and perfumes, which bordered fearfully upon effeminacy the finest French cambric handkerchief peeping purposely from its pocket; raven hair studiously arranged, yet calm as a new wig; — and you have Sir Charles Wiffington before you as he stood by the side of Melton de Mowbray.</p>
<p>As to Lord Jimmysham, we must dress him in haste, — an event which never yet occurred unless at his birth.</p>
<p>Jimmysham was decidedly handsome; and, if his light eyes were wanting in the sublime dignity of expression which we associate with the father of the gods, this did not prevent a strong resemblance to the cloud-compelling almighty Jove.</p> 
<p>As we are not writing to heathens, and, as the history of pagan gods and goddesses is no longer the exclusive study of our classical schools, it may be well to say that his lordship’s features approached the <i>beau idéal</i> of a celebrated statue, representing Jupiter, the supreme deity of the ancients. Who first made the discovery, we know not; but, once made, the engraver’s art multiplied the idea, and, doubtless, served to strengthen the chain which bound the host of his fair worshippers. As may be supposed, the likeness was stronger upon paper than in the living man; for, although the hair might be arranged — the moustaches petted and pointed to favour the similitude — the neck and bust were veiled by the dress of man, which, most assuredly, is any thing but godlike. In speaking of his dress, we are bound to allow originality to a man whose name, like that of Wellington, is immortalised by a portion of dress, which, since the fall of Adam, is even more indispensable than a pair of boots. It was not this, however, nor his ruffles, when ruffles were unknown, except at court; it was not the chains “in which he was hung,” when that fashion was confined to the pirate of the seas, or gentlemen of the highway; neither was it the taste and judgment, which even François allowed with a shrug, that made Lord Jimmysham the fascinating puppy.</p>
<p>These were accessories after the fact; but the fact was, that he owed his success to the grace and polish of good breeding. As a young man, he always reminded us of the <i>politesse</i> of the good old French schools grafted upon an English stock. There was none of the grimace of the Parisian noble; but there was all his devotion to the fair sex — to society in general. Even Jimmysham would have blushed to see a lady ring the bell, open the door, seek a book, or reach a scarf; but it was not by these more homespun acts of politeness that he won his way. There was a delicacy, a refinement, a <i>prévoyance</i> in his attentions — a masterly perception of the elegant nothings, which flatter, gratify, and win the heart of woman: we are painting men as they are, not as they should be: and again we repeat, that, without talent, mind, sense, and imagination. Lord Jimmysham could not have shone in the sphere to which, unfortunately, his abilities were devoted. Your foolish puppies are those who flash for a season, and sell the remainder of their lives to Jews, poverty, and ruin.</p>
<p>One more remark, which applies with equal force to the portraits we have sketched: however quaint and extraordinary the style adopted, it sat upon them as easy as if all the world were dressed alike. No twitchings of the nerves bespoke a consciousness of the vulgar gaze: there were no awkward misgivings of the part they played; none, in short, of those symptoms which betray the empty coxcomb, like one who (to quote an instance we saw but yesterday), going to a country church, with ruffles on his wrist, and rings on his kid gloves, was so overpowered by the admiration he had courted, that the hands, after searching in vain for a hiding-place, looked as restless and wretched as a hunted rat with its earth stopped.</p>
<p>During the interval employed in our sketch, we must request the reader to imagine that the curtain has been raised — the lamps not only raised, but trimmed anew, much to the annoyance of Lady Blankisle — that is, when she found it convenient to be thus troubled.</p> 
<p>“Helen, my dear, have you brought my bottle of salts?” said the marchioness, as she gently passed a hand over her forehead.</p>
<p>“No, mamma; you assured me your head would not ache this evening; but I fear that it does.”</p>
<p>“Slightly, my love — you, perhaps, have your <i>vinaigrette</i> box?”</p>
<p>“You forget, dear mamma, that I do not possess such a thing.”</p>
<p>Mowbray started, inwardly at least — then gazed more intently than ever on Lady Helen’s eyes, but could read nothing: he saw, or fancied that he saw, a smile at the corner of the mouth: if so, however, it was but momentary. She continued, with an air of concern, to express some affectionate regret, which Lady Blankisle interrupted by saying, —</p>
<p>“I see your cousin, Georgiana, has been more provident; she is coquetting with one at this moment.”</p>
<p>“Do allow me,” said Lord Jimmysham, “to be your messenger; and disarm a hand which wields a bauble as Flavia did the fan which</p> 
<div>
<p>‘Gave coolness to the matchless dame;<br> 
To every other breast a flame.’”<br> </p>
</div>
<p>“Do not trust him,” said Sir Charles Wiffington, “near one</p> 
<div>
<p>‘Who can the least and slightest toy<br>
With such resistless art employ;’”<br></p>
</div>
<p>a truth which his lordship forgot to quote. “Pray do not trust him,” repeated Sir Charles, adding, with one of his calm, satirical sneers; “by the side of so much earthly beauty, his feet will lose the wings of Mercury, and his head be turned like Jove’s by Danae.”</p>
<p>“You are too severe, Sir Charles,” replied the marchioness; “but, for a poet, your judgment is good:” and, turning to Jimmysham, who was bending to receive permission to fly, and dazzling her ladyship’s sensitive eyes by his profusion of chains, she added, — “No, indeed, I will not allow you, it were unjust to my niece; for I see you are armed with a shower of gold.”</p> 
<p>“Very good! — excellent!” said Jimmysham, smiling a laugh as naturally as if Jove had been complimented on one of his attributes: “doubt not my return,” he continued. “Jove had never left the skies had he looked on beauty so worthy of his throne as that before me.”</p>
<p>The marchioness, who in her youth had been a slight beauty, received a portion of Lord Jimmysham’s bow and speech as an offering due to Juno; while the lovely Lady 
Helen Fawndove took the compliment as Venuses are wont to take the empty homage of those they do not value. </p>
<p>“I shall be delighted to go,” said Sir Charles Wiffington, who was standing behind Lady Blankisle’s chair, and hoping in his heart to succeed to the duke’s seat; but the result of his joke had left him no alternative.</p>
<p>“Rather let me be honoured,” said Mowbray, who was standing somewhat in the rear of the two who had already offered their services. “Poets are more treacherous than the gods. Sir Charles will linger in the clouds; and I am no judge of beauty except in a horse, ‘where ignorance is bliss:’ — what is it, Sir Charles?”</p>
<p>“You won’t commit the folly of being wise,” said Sir Charles Wiffington, with doubtful emphasis upon the word you, in revenge of Mowbray’s slur upon poetry.</p>
<p>But Lady Blankisle thought that it was time to instruct a young man with five thousand a-year, and sole heir to the richest banker in London. She accordingly granted to Sir Charles the delight he craved, <i>contra cœur</i>, and, by that means, cleared the way for Mowbray’s approach.</p>
<p>“Do tell me,” she said, “if it is true that your friend, Boltville, is likely to inherit his uncle’s estates? Do point him out to me: is he not standing in the bend of the house, in the box next to the duke’s? I am so curious to know him.”</p>
<p>Mowbray looked, but his position did not command the bend; and he pleaded his most excessive regrets at not being able to see a friend whose name, connected with the heirdom, awakened some undefined notions of jealousy. There was no cause for this; the marchioness never sought for uncertainties, unless to make sure of a mask.</p>
<p>“They say he is handsome — I knew his mother — I am really curious — do take my seat, and tell me if I am right?” said the marchioness, as she once more retreated to the rear.</p>
<p>Mowbray obeyed; and, having ascertained that the marchioness’s eyes were not quite so weak as she affected, he was about to resign his point of view, when Lady Blankisle assured him her curiosity was satisfied.</p>
<p>“It is a relief,” she said, “to escape the glare of those odious lamps:” I suffer so much from nervous headach. Ah! — hush! hush! — not a word: this is my favourite quartet — pray, don’t move: I insist upon your keeping my seat: even a De Mowbray should learn to obey,” she added in a lower tone, with one of the most gracious smiles, and with her skinny hand pressed Mowbray into her chair and service.</p>
<p>At this moment Melton de Mowbray caught sight of the sporting group in the pit — their eyes were fixed upon Lady Blankisle’s box; and he could see by their manner that they were canvassing the odds for or against himself: he felt that he <i>had been manœuvred;</i> and, spurning the toils with which he had fallen, he would, had it been possible, have left the spot for which, but a little while before, he sighed as the goal of earthly bliss. Lady Helen Fawndove, on the other hand, but too sensible of her mother’s weakness, felt humiliated and indignant.</p>
<p>“He shall not think me a slave to be sold and bought,” said Lady Helen within herself, as she proudly, yet mournfully, assumed an air of cold indifference.</p>
<p>“Is she too a manœuvrer?” thought Mowbray, for an instant, as he looked on the daughter, and recalled the smile which he had witnessed in the morning. Their eyes met — were fixed for a moment: the first expression in either passed away; anger, injustice, and hypocrisy, perished in the light of kindling love; each looked upon the heart’s mysterious page, and each seemed to have found the diamond key which unlocked its beautiful treasure.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say how long, or how deeply, they might have read, had not the manœuvrer closed the volume; and, as usual with such persons, defeated her own design.</p>
<p>“How exquisitely sweet!” exclaimed the marchioness, at some ravishing turn of her favourite quartet. “Helen, my love, do lend Mr. De Mowbray your book — the words are even sweeter than the music.”</p>
<p>Lady Helen, who knew the words by heart, was glad that the book had fallen at her feet, and wished it might remain there; but mamma’s eyes were too quick, in spite of their delicacy; and Mowbray was called upon to pick up the book, and Lady Helen to point out the words — of course, they were all about love, and that sort of thing. Mowbray gave the praise which politeness exacted; and said within himself, in the bitterness of spirit, —</p> 
<p>“I will not be made a laughing-stock for bettors.”</p>
<p>Lady Helen Fawndove read his feelings, once more humbled and indignant; she stifled a sigh which struggled for escape, and, with her opera-glass, concealed a rising tear, which had fallen on the page of her dark expressive eyes.</p>
<p>Sir Charles Wiffington re-entered: it was a relief to both; for he withdrew the eyes of Lady Blankisle, by whom they felt that they were watched as a fowler fixes on the game for which his nets are spread: if, however, there was not a sense of positive restraint for the rest of the opera, truth was concealed in the depths of the heart — feeling was shrouded by the garb of worldly manners, and, more than all, by that tragi-comic playfulness of style so peculiar to both, and which always left the hearers in doubt how far their words were in earnest.</p>
<p>“A thousand thanks, my dear Sir Charles! pray forgive the trouble I have given,” said the marchioness, as she received <i>le vinaigre aromatique</i>, and had recourse to the remedy she did not require.</p>
<p>Sir Charles, of course, was only too happy. Mowbray’s eyes were irresistibly attracted by the bauble in Lady Blankisle’s hands; they followed its journeys as it travelled from her ladyship’s lap to her ladyship’s nose, from the nose to the lap: he almost fancied he could recognise his morning’s acquaintance: he turned to Lady Helen’s eyes for confirmation, — they said nothing; but, surprised in the act of watching Mowbray’s scrutiny, the tongue was obliged to speak, and said, with perfect <i>naïveté</i>, —</p>
<p>“I hope you do not suffer like mamma. I wish I possessed a box to offer; shall I borrow my cousin’s?” </p>
<p>“By no means,” answered Mowbray; “I assure you my head does not ache, although it is somewhat confused. What a dream is life! — do you ever doubt reality?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, constantly; but there is no doubting the beauty of this air, though the words are silly nonsense;” and, forthwith, Lady Helen composed herself to listen with such devoted attention, that it would have been rudeness in Mowbray to speak another word.</p>
<p>“I feel so greatly obliged,” continued the marchioness, between the interval of application, “I am such a sad sufferer. Is not Georgiana divine? — quite worthy of your pen. Sir Charles. My headach has passed like magic — quite gone: you are so kind. I hope you did not play <i>le médecin malgré lui</i>.”</p>
<p>“Oh, fie! my dear Lady Blankisle, how ungracious to suspect me! I do assure you my heart is still on the left side; and, with permission, I will return the <i>vinaigrette</i> to your lovely niece: I fear she is, in truth, a sufferer,” said Sir Charles, with some stress on the word “truth.”</p>
<p>The marchioness was much too old and steady a manœuvrer to be discomposed; she begged the box might be restored. “It was so like Georgiana’s gentle nature: she was so grieved; but who could have thought that one so young, so blooming, ever suffered from the nerves?”</p> 
<p>The baronet once more played Mercury: Lord Jimmysham followed, and, waving the dignity of the thunderbolting Jove, begged to be introduced under Sir Charles’s wing; others bowed in and bowed out, some said their soft nothings, some whispered their bits of bitter scandal, others sported their milk-and-water wit, and so they came and went; while Mowbray sat out the ballet —dissatisfied, yet fascinated; doubting much, yet determined to know more, if the opportunity occurred.</p>

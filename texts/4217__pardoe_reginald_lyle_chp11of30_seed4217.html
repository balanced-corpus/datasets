<title>Chapter 11 of REGINALD LYLE by MISS PARDOE</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- CHAPTER 11<br>WIN OR LOSE-->
<p>It was with a far less buoyant step than that with which he had left his home, that Octavius Lyle pursued his way to Bedford Square. One fold of the curtain had been raised, and he had obtained a glimpse of that real world which reveals itself so coldly and so bleakly to the sanguine and the young, who are ever prone to anticipate that the promised good is to be seized at once in its full fruition, as Minerva sprang into life from the brain of Jove. The lesson had been a bitter one; the more bitter because it had been wholly unanticipated. Generous to a fault, utterly regard less of self, and ever ready to extend a succoring hand to others, the warm-hearted young man was unable to realize the disappoint ment to which he had been subjected; and as he gradually over came the indignation which the egotism of his relative had elicited, his spirit sank, and he began to have misgivings, which, like the shadows that haunted the tent of Richard, filled him with apprehension and dismay.</p>
<p>More thau once he paused, and asked himself if he should indeed persist in his purpose, and perhaps subject himself to a repetition of the outrage which he had already endured: but in every case the question was answered by the beloved vision of Alice — <i>his</i> Alice — whom he could only hope to win, when he had proved himself worthy of her by his efforts to offer her a home. A poor one it might be — it must be — but still a home. He could not owe <i>all</i> to her; his manhood forbade it; and so he again moved onward, and crushed down his rebellious pride, and strove to hope, and to feel a renewed trust in his fellow-men; but the effort was a painful one, and thus he reached his destination, depressed and desponding.</p>
<p>Mr. Percival Lyle was at home; and his relative was ushered into what was facetiously called his study; where, in dressing-gown and slippers — for the merchant, who was at that time not particularly anxious to make himself too conspicuous in the city, had deemed it expedient to labor under an attack of influenza — he found his cousin and namesake, with sundry letters and papers, and a tumbler of barley-water, occupying the table near him.</p>
<p>“Ha, Octavius, my dear fellow, how are you?” exclaimed the merchant condescendingly, as he motioned him to take a seat; “I was thinking of you half an hour ago. I was, I assure you. Why, you foolish boy, how badly you played your cards in Hertford Street; it quite annoyed me, it did, upon my honor.”</p>
<p>“You are very good, Mr. Lyle.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you must no longer call me Mr. Lyle; I am superseded, you know, by the Mexican nabob, and must fall back upon nay baptismal appellation, which fortunately is sonorous enough. I am an invalid, as you see. Dr. Davis has absolutely forbidden me to leave the house; he says that I am not equal to business, and that exposure to the external air would aggravate the attack; so hero I am, nailed to my arm-chair, just at the very moment when my presence is absolutely essential in the counting-house. However, 1 suppose I must submit; and I am doing my best to support the infliction with patience.”</p>
<p>“I trust that your prudence will tend to shorten your sufferings. I am truly sorry to see you such an invalid.”</p>
<p>“It is a bore; but what is to be done? Barley-water is a poor substitute for sherry; but we are all mortal, my dear fellow, and we must submit.”</p>
<p>“A painful truism!” said Octavius, with a smile; “I hope that Mrs. Percival and your daughters have escaped this almost universal scourge.”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you, I believe so. Mrs Percival has driven out to make calls—”</p>
<p>Mrs. Percival was, <i>par parenthese</i>, as we may as well chronicle at once, one of those busily-idle persons who spend half their lives in making calls. It was in vain that at door after door she met the stereotyped answer, “Not at home;” it never interfered in the least with her cherished mania. Day by day she donned her flounces and her feathers, and pursued her ordinary avocation of acquaintance-hunting; and many were the pasteboard records of her perseverance, which, with a heroism worthy of a better cause, she scattered over the London streets and squares. So earnest, indeed, was she in her vocation, that some among her more intimate associates were wont to declare that she would solicit an hour’s respite upon her death-bed, in order that she might have an opportunity of distributing her P.P.C.’s. But this is a digression.</p>
<p>“As to my daughters,” continued Mr. Percival with a marked assumption of dignity; “they never receive visitors when their mother is from home. Miss Stapleton is rigid upon that point; and we never interfere with her arrangements. Indeed, we were singularly fortunate to secure such a monitress for our young people, even although we pay tolerably high for the privilege of possessing her; as she had never previously consented to enter the family of a commoner. But with money, you know, my dear fellow, one is enabled to overcome all difficulties; and having succeeded, we are naturally anxious to let her have her own way in every particular.”</p>
<p>There was a pause; a trying one to Octavius; but at length he spoke.</p>
<p>“Mr. Lyle—”</p>
<p>The merchant smiled benignly; he was flattered by what he assumed to be a feeling of unconquerable respect in his young kinsman.</p>
<p>“Well, what are you about to say?”</p>
<p>“Inquire rather what I am going to ask,” said Octavius, forcing a smile, and endeavoring to appear unconstrained; “for, to be frank with you, I am about to solicit a favor.”</p>
<p>“Ha, indeed!” And the dark eyebrows met portentously.</p>
<p>“Yes, truly; and yet one which will place me under no pecuniary obligations to your kindness.”</p>
<p>“Good. You want me to heal the breach between you and our uncle; but it won’t do, my dear fellow. I assure you, on—my—honor—” and Mr. Percival Lyle lingered over the asseveration as though he were pledging all that was dearest to him in the world, “that if you had only witnessed the scene which took place after you left the house, you would feel the utter impossibility of a reconciliation. The old gentleman was furious at what he termed your insolence — the insolence of a poor relation — and you can form no conception of his violence when it is once aroused. Not, mind you, that I blame <i>you</i>, my dear boy,” continued the urbane and indulgent gentleman; “I consider that your conduct was just what it should have been — open, fearless, and spirited! I was proud of you; I was, upon my honor. Such a contrast from those sneaks the Staintons, who were afraid to utter a word awry lest they should lose a legacy. Not, however “—he pursued confidentially, “that they need have troubled themselves upon the subject, as I happen to know that none of the Mexican gold will go to gild the school-forms at Clapham; for, as a matter of course, the pride of old Lyle revolted at the ‘fashionable establishment.’”</p>
<p>“But the sons—” interposed Octavius.</p>
<p>“Ay, the sons,” echoed his companion contemptuously; “two pretty fellows, are they not, to do away with such an impression? Why, they have not spirit enough to escape from the stocks and back-board of their manœnvring mother, when she is pleased to inflict her displeasure upon them. No, no; I soon saw what the nabob had thought of <i>them</i>. They have no chance.”</p>
<p>“You are rapidly narrowing the circle.”</p>
<p>“I speak advisedly, Octavius. I have great experience of life; and Mr. Lyle, whatever may be his commercial abilities — which, judging by the result, must be considerable — is a perfect child in worldly matters. He betrays himself every instant. I watched him narrowly; for, as you know, I have also a stake in this venture, and I naturally gave the subject my best consideration; so that I very soon detected his antipathies.”</p>
<p>“It was not, however, to trouble you upon that subject that I intruded on you to-day,” said Octavius, evading all comment upon the self-gratulation of his pompons cousin; “for, circumstanced as I am, it would be impossible for me to make advances to Mr. Lyle. He might misinterpret my motive, and I cannot condescend to cringe to any man’s wealth.”</p>
<p>“Right, right, my dear fellow; a very proper and commendable feeling on your part.”</p>
<p>“My business is therefore solely with yourself. As I before remarked, it involves no application for money. I am well aware that whatever may be the resources of individuals extensively engaged in commerce, no one has a right to ask a pecuniary favor which might be conferred at an inconvenient moment. What I come to request is, that you will be good enough to become one of my securities; and, by so doing, enable me to obtain a respectable income as clerk in a banking-house.”</p>
<p>“And who is to be the other?”</p>
<p>“I am not, I regret to say, enabled to answer the question decidedly; but I have no doubt that a second will be secured in the course of the day. I <i>had</i> calculated upon our cousin Lancaster, but he has failed me.”</p>
<p>“Upon what pretext?”</p>
<p>“He is anxious that I should emigrate to Australia.”</p>
<p>“And he is right. A very prudent, far-sighted man is Joseph Lancaster. He knows that all professions are overstocked at home; and that a fine, energetic young man, who has to make his way in the world, has an opening in the gold regions which he must be insane to neglect Take his advice, Octavius; take his advice — it is admirable,”</p>
<p>And thc merchant inhaled a huge pinch of snuff from a richlyly-chased and enamelled box.</p>
<p>“By Jove, I never felt so great a respect for Lancaster’s understanding before. Go, of course. I will pay your passage; though I have, as you know, an expensive family — a <i>very</i> expensive family — but, on such an occasion, to further the fortunes of so near a relation, and because I have moreover a great personal regard for yourself, I will undertake to defray the expenses of your passage, so that you need not encroach on your own funds. When do you think it likely that you shall leave England?’</p>
<p>“I will try the Bank first.”</p>
<p>“Then you are mad, quite mad! Have you read the ‘Times’ of yesterday? The quantity of gold shipped at Melbourne is positively fabulous! I expect good interest for my advance, in the shape of brooches and earrings for Mrs. Percival and the girls, I assure you.”</p>
<p>“And your name meanwhile as one of my securities, Mr. Lyle?”</p>
<p>“Impossible, my dear fellow. Im-pos-si-ble. Like Joseph Lancaster, I am a prudent man. Anything that I can say for you — although even that, in point of fact, cannot, as you are aware, amount to much; for (if the truth must be told, I actually know very little about you,) still, what I <i>can</i> say in your behalf, I <i>will</i> say; and I am not unconscious of the risk of saying anything in such cases; but I shall not hesitate, nevertheless, trusting that your future conduct will be such as to justify my confidence. The act of putting my pen to paper in emergencies like that under consideration, is, however, peculiarly obnoxious to me; and I consequently feel too much delicacy to mislead you for an instant on a point of so much importance to your future prospects; while I confess that I decline with the less reluctance, from an innate conviction that you have too keen a sense of your own dignity to accept a service grudgingly rendered. Of that fact, your manly conduct the other evening in Hertford Street has perfectly satisfied me. I am sorry, very sorry to disappoint you, but my principles are altogether contrary to such a concession.”</p>
<p>“You refuse me, then?”</p>
<p>“I am compelled to do go. I must be consistent. I pride my self upon my consistency. I never became security for anyone in the whole course of my life; I didn’t, upon my honor.”</p>
<p>“I will not intrude upon you further, Mr. Lyle.”</p>
<p>“Oh, do not name that, my dear boy; I am happy to see you; and Mrs. Percival would have been happy to see you, had she not driven out to make calls; and the young ladies also; but Miss Stapleton is averse to their wasting their tune, especially of a morning, otherwise—”</p>
<p>“Spare yourself all apologies, Mr. Lyle,” said Octavius haughtily; “they are quite unnecessary. I will not detain you longer. I wish you a good morning.”</p>
<p>“Good morning, my dear Octavius, good morning. Now don’t be wrong-headed, but think over Lancaster’s advice, and my advice. Australia will be the making of you; there you will have a clear field; while here, in London, you will find so many people in your way.”</p>
<p>“That is a tolerably universal fate, I imagine, Mr. Lyle. At least I perceive, that insignificant as I may be, I am myself in the way of other people. But, after all, the struggle is exciting enough; and I at least, for one, will not be the coward to shrink from it.”</p>
<p>“Poor, misguided boy!” And Mr. Percival Lyle sighed as though he could scarcely support the pressure of his feelings. “With such an opening before you, I cannot conceive how you can hesitate for a moment. You have already experienced the utter impossibility of making your way in London — for as to inducing any safe and creditable individuals to take such a step as that which you request, you may rely upon <i>me</i> that it is a mere chimera — and yet when a brilliant prospect opens before you, and that by your unaided exertions you are secure of rendering yourself independent in a few years, you actually refuse to avail yourself of so excellent an opportunity! However, I feel so sincere an interest in your welfare, that I shall hope to hear that you have be come more judicious when you have taken time to reflect. And — remember — my word is my bond. The passage-money shall be forthcoming, whenever you are prepared to draw it.”</p>
<p>And so they parted.</p>

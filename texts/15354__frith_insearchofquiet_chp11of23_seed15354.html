<title>Chapter 11 of In Search of Quiet by Frith</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- Chapter 11 -->
<p>While at supper, Mr. Carlton tells me he has made Mr. Banquier’s acquaintance and likes him. They spend evenings together, and read each other their works. He thinks very highly of the effort Mr.
Banquier is at present engaged on, from which I diagnose that Mr. Banquier thinks very highly of Mr. Carlton’s ditto.</p>
<p>“Most friendship is feigning.” But for real, though possibly sometimes unconscious feigning, give me the literary.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carlton is mostly silent about Mr. Banquier. When she does speak, she rather damns him with faint praise. Clearly her woman’s instinct (at which Mr. Carlton laughs vociferously) is at work.</p>
<p>But I don’t judge Mr. Carlton to be very penetrating. Not many artists are; they can be so easily disarmed by admiration of their performances.</p>
<p>On the other hand, let me not suppose that I am going to see all, justly and without exaggeration. Mr. Banquier has made the same doubtful impression on me he evidently has on Mrs. Carlton, but we may both turn out to be wrong. Perhaps Mr. Banquier, when he detects our suspect views, will take special pains to prove us so; for often our best efforts arise from our bad ones being scented in embryo.
And there you have the explanation of the occasional nobility of action of the otherwise professional sinner.</p>
<p>I tried, judiciously, to discover Mrs. Carlton’s views of Miss Fanny. She was rather reticent, and said she had seen very little of her lately. She saw much more of her in the early spring before they went up to town.</p>
<p>“I think she’s got rather tired of us,” she said, gently. Then she added, with mild disapproval, “She reads a number of rather odd books, books I shouldn’t like to read.”</p>
<p>“I suppose Mr. Banquier lends them to her?”</p>
<p>“I suppose so.”</p>
<p>When Mrs. Carlton left us to go up-stairs and see that no one had carried off the baby during supper, we lit our pipes and I put a few discreet questions to the poet himself about Miss Harewood.</p>
<p>Not much use, for he’s the type before whom a veritable <em>drame du coeur</em> might be played without his seeing any of it.</p>
<p>He considers Miss Fanny a very nice girl, and he supposes she and Mr. Banquier have fallen in love with each other, will be shortly publicly engaged, and married before the summer’s over. Why not? But
he confesses he knows nothing of Mr. Banquier’s views on matrimony; only concludes they are those of all the respectable unmarried world.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pearce has a great liking for and confidence in Mr. Banquier (he has evidently flattered the foolish old woman), and, as every one knows, allows the young couple to go about together as much as they please; so, except for the major’s odd watchfulness and her own good sense, the girl is left pretty much unprotected. It’s all a fine field, isn’t it, for a young man whose tastes may lie in wringing the trusting female heart!</p>
<p>There, that’s my last word on the subject; for the rest we shall see.</p>
<p>There was a tap on the hall door as we sat smoking, and to the cry of “Come in” Mr. Banquier entered. He was in a somewhat flamboyant smoking-suit, and had brought his pipe round to join Mr.
Carlton. He was evidently surprised to see me, but shook hands with grave politeness. Then he sat down and fell to considering me covertly over the bowl of his cherry-wood.</p>
<p>Silence on the entrance of a visitor is always awkward, for it amounts to a confession that he has been under discussion. Mr. Carlton hastened to fill it by asking after his day’s work.</p>
<p>“<em>Ça marche</em>,” replied Mr. Banquier, laconically.</p>
<p>Then he turned his head condescendingly towards me over his high collar, and said, “I hear you’ve made it up with the major.”</p>
<p>“Well,” I replied, “the major has rather made it up with me, having, apparently, discovered he can make use of me.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that tramp. The old gentleman was good enough to pay me a visit this morning, to know if I couldn’t give him some copying. I said, flatly, ‘No,’ and showed him out. Why, I should go
mad with a man in the room while I was at work.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so should I!” added Mr. Carlton (who is engaged on a verse translation of the “Georgics”), not to be behind him in artistic sensibility.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, you see, my business doesn’t matter. It’s only a law-book, and will all have to be rewritten, some time or other, by somebody who can write more plainly than I.”</p>
<p>Mr. Banquier gave me another look, as much as to say, “Fancy any sane person interesting himself in law, when there’s all the wide domain of art!”</p>
<p>It was impertinent, but he’s quite right. I wouldn’t touch the thing if only there were any other subject I were capable of handling. Sometimes, in fact, I get so weary of its mere mechanism that I make up my mind to drop it altogether for a time and try
my hand at a novel for a change. But I never get beyond the opening chapter, with a fine description of scenery in it; for when I try to make the people talk, they do it so monstrously unnaturally that my
sense of humor comes to the rescue, the sheets go into the fire, and I’m quite relieved to get back to my <em>Weights and Measures</em>.</p>
<p>Still, I’m always glad to hear about novels, having devoured a good many; so I set to work to question Mr. Banquier about his book, to which he answered rather resentfully, as coming from one of the unenlightened, to whom he should never be able to make his large ideas manifest.</p>
<p>With such gentry there’s but one way; to let them see you are familiar with Tolstoi, Dostoieffsky, Bourget, Zola, Marcel Prévost, and the rest of them, great and small. Then they conceive you are of the elect (so far as reading is concerned, at any rate), and begin graciously to expand.</p>
<p>I was just setting my little trick in movement when Mrs. Carlton joined us from up-stairs. Mr. Banquier rose to greet her with the forced smile of a man who knows he’s not quite liked, and asked
with false interest after the baby.</p>
<p>“Asleep,” replied Mrs. Carlton, with a happy smile, and sat down to her work. “Well, what are you all talking about?”</p>
<p>“We were trying,” I said, “to get Mr. Banquier to tell us about his novel, but he’s shy.”</p>
<p>An irritating little speech which had the effect I fear I meant it should, for “Not at all shy I” said he, giving me a haughty stare; “I should only be afraid of not being quite understood.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Carlton hastened to ask him if he were playing in the match on Saturday, and he replied, “Oh yes, I suppose so!”—in the weary accents of a man who doesn’t like being taken away from his work
for anything so trivial.</p>
<p>Our conversation was rather languishing and intermittent, for Mr. Banquier plainly intimidates and silences the gentle Mrs. Carlton, so it fell to her husband to keep us alive.</p>
<p>He has an odd little humor which much tickles me, though I can conceive myself easily growing tired of it. He has read a large number of circulating-library novels, and, when he’s alone with his
wife, does scarcely anything without quoting appropriately from them.</p>
<p>If he gets up for the tobacco, he remarks, gravely, “He then rose to his full height, and with his nervous white hand reached for the heavily scented Latakia which, in the chagrin of his tortured, sinful life, had been his constant solace and companion.”</p>
<p>Then he continues: “Thrusting in the priceless weed with a gesture of impatience, he bit his nether lip till the blood flowed, and, clapping his feverish hands together sharply—”</p>
<p>“Really, Tom!” chides Mrs. Carlton, as she gives him a match, “if you go on like that, people will think you’re mad.”</p>
<p>To which Mr. Carlton, not at all disturbed, “She gave him a scornful glance out of her deep violet eyes, and, sinking back in the luxurious chair under the soft wax-light, languidly resumed her gold netting.”</p>
<p>I don’t think Mr. Banquier quite likes it, and laughs rather uneasily. Perhaps it is a reflection of his style, which old Mrs. Martin describes as somewhat Byzantine.</p>
<p>But nothing stops Mr. Carlton when the fit is on him, and when ten o’clock struck, and Mrs. Carlton rose to leave us, he remarked, “She just touched his marble forehead with her full red lips, and with the lithe movement of a panther passed out of the room, leaving the faint odor of <em>chypre</em> behind her.”</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, after shaking hands with us, she simply pulled his hair for him.</p>
<p>We smoked for some little time in silence, and then Mr. Banquier turned to me again over his high collar and asked, “Going to stay in Thorpe long?”</p>
<p>I said I thought a month or so more, till my work was finished.</p>
<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Banquier pretended not to hear, so I repeated my question. He started from a sham reverie and replied, “I beg your pardon! Oh yes, I think I shall be here another month, at least—in fact, till
my work is finished. When do you go up to town?” he asked Mr. Carlton.</p>
<p>“Second week in June. We’re going up together for the first time since we’ve been married.”</p>
<p>“Where are you going to stop?”</p>
<p>“My wife’s sister has taken rooms for us off the Fulham Road. Nice and near the ‘buses and underground.”</p>
<p>It was the last word spoken for a long time, and the silence grew grim.</p>
<p>How strange it is, the variety of silence; its ease and then again its oppression. It didn’t affect me, nothing does when I have a pipe, but I could feel that Mr. Carlton was suffering from it. My fault, for if I hadn’t been there the two authors would have enjoyed themselves over their literature. I felt inclined to ask the poet to read us something, but the request would have sounded so bald and
sudden that I fell to asking questions about Thorpe people instead.</p>
<p>It was characteristic of them both that, whereas Mr. Carlton had lived in the place a couple of years, he knew next to nothing but names and occupations, while Mr. Banquier, who had barely had a couple of months of it, had managed to dive under the surface and come up again with his mouth full of <em>trouvailles</em>, mainly, as such things mostly are, of an unpleasant nature. Mr. Carlton was constantly exploding with “I never heard that! That’s news to me! How did you find that out?”</p>
<p>How had he found it out? how had he got it all together? by what patient questioning, observation, deduction?</p>
<p>Here were the Westons: to Mrs. Chick, quiet, respectable people; to Mr. Carlton, jolly farmers of the old English October-brew type; but, somehow, Mr. Banquier had discovered that Weston had drinking-bouts a good deal heavier than the mere excusable “market-merry;” that Mrs. Weston, before marriage, had thrown her bonnet over the mill; and that the aunt who had died and left them a bit of money had been of the disreputable-house-keeper order, living with a morose cattle-dealer somewhere in Lincolnshire.</p>
<p>The Poynders? Sir Arthur had been one of the wildest of the wild young men about town in the early days (he is over eighty) of her present gracious Majesty; had been a pillar of the old gambling-houses in Jermyn Street and the night-houses off the Haymarket; had run away to Scotland with his first wife and married her before Laird, the weaver-priest, and now lived in constant dread of being
poisoned by his second, the Greek, for the all-sufficient reason that he spends his time devising new tortures for the unhappy old woman’s soul and body.</p>
<p>As for John, the handsome young soldier son, nothing that Mr. Banquier can say is contemptuous enough—his stupidity, fatuity, crass ignorance; wherein I am not sorry to detect the spice of so
natural and wholesome a feeling as jealousy.</p>
<p>Dr. and old Mrs. Martin; Mr. Kearsley, the clergyman; Mr. Ferrier; even the harmless, unnecessary Vegetarians; he had some disagreeable revelations to make about them all. For him they were only human documents—detestable phrase!—and the more odiously he could score their records the more he felt their portraiture was complete. At the same time I felt (as one always does) that while drawing them so ruthlessly, in colors so black, he was drawing himself in colors even blacker.</p>
<p>In all his review of our small society, I observe Mr. Banquier makes no mention of Major Ross. Either he hasn’t managed to scavenge up anything about him, or he won’t tell us what he knows. All
he says, and that truthfully enough, is that a man doesn’t retire to a village and lead the strange life he does for no appreciable reason.</p>
<p>Also he begs to point out that there is no Major Ross in the Army List who could correspond to our major; which gives one furiously to think, as the French say.</p>
<p>When I suggest that possibly all the major does is to live in penury for the sake of Tommy and his future, he doesn’t think it worth while to answer me. I dare say he’s right, for I don’t know that narrowness of means will altogether explain the old man’s attitude towards us all. I wonder what he thinks he knows about me? how he explains my presence here with a law-book I can work at much easier in Paper Buildings? What a fine contempt he would have
for me if he knew the truth!</p>
<p>It was striking eleven when we rose to go. Mr. Carlton saw us to the door, and I walked with Mr. Banquier to the entrance to the Redan. As we parted, for the first time he mentioned Miss Harewood, and asked me to come in some afternoon to meet her and Mrs. Pearce at tea.</p>
<p>In the starlight I looked into his eyes, and could read nothing there but dark fatigue and indifference. “She’s a very charming girl,” he said. “Oh, I forgot! why, of course, you met her the other afternoon playing tennis. Good-night to you.”</p>
<p>Something inscrutable and evil about the young man, and, for that reason, possibly, something interesting too. Perhaps, however, it’s only because it’s the first time I’ve really met him that I haven’t
altogether got his measure. I often find my imagination at work about people when I first meet them, forming sombre picturesque images, until they do or say something that reduces them to the most
ordinary of lay figures. Indeed, the most striking at first sight are often the emptiest when you get to know them better; the explanation being, no doubt, that they arc so satisfied with looking like something real that they don’t care to take the trouble to
become so.</p>
<p>By-the-way, Carlton tells me Mr. Banquier is a man of old family, an only son, with a widowed mother living in Guernsey, and a married sister in London. He was educated at Wellington and Jesus, Cambridge; took a fairly good degree and had some thoughts of the Bar, but has never gone further towards being called than living in King’s Bench Walk, which accounts for my having seen him in the Temple.</p>
<p>He won the Chancellor’s medal for his poem on “Cyprus,” but frankly admits he’s no poet, and has abandoned the art, for which judicious resolve Mr. Carlton highly commends him.</p>
<p>It seems you cannot better please an artist than by deserting his metier; partly because you leave the road freer for him, and partly because you tacitly admit his superior ability in the practice of it.</p>
<p>Friday Night.</p>
<p>I stood in the inn garden at the water’s edge, by Marling bridge, as the last of the May dusk was falling. To the full pulsation of the nightingale as he throbbed in lonely ecstasy from the dark hill thickets, enchanted, I listened. Oh, the longing he raised in me, the delicious tenderness, the regret! His rich, graceful fluting, which is so far from being human, yet touched for me all the aching springs of my humanity, and my heart seemed swung on golden wires
vibrating to his every liquid note.</p>
<p>There was no passion in it, only lofty, melodious grief, and then the grieving swelled to resignation, and higher still to joy.</p>
<p>Enchanted, I listened.</p>
<p>Yet I suppose it was only the sweet, cool dusk, the gentle river, the pure country sky that made the fluting seem to’ me divine; ah, and the evening peace, for the time, in my own heart. Music is in a man’s own soul; if his nature be not in tune, all the dulcimers in the world will be harsh to him and jarring. Would it were always there in mine!</p>
<p>As I strolled back on to the bridge there was some one, a girl, leaning against the parapet, looking down into the stealthy water. It was Miss Harewood; the nightingale was singing to her, too.</p>
<p>She saw my white trousers, and turned to me as I came along the bridge.</p>
<p>“Meditating suicide ?” I asked.</p>
<p>She leaned over the parapet and looked down upon the mother-of-pearl river, broken into oily swirls.</p>
<p>“How easy it would be, wouldn’t it?” she said, softly.</p>
<p>So she turned to me, and, talking in the hasty, inconsequent fashion a girl employs when her heart’s full of other things, we strolled back through Marling together. It was as though she were afraid, if she stopped, I should ask her why she was out so late
on the bridge alone.</p>
<p>We talked a little of the cricket-match to-morrow, and of Miss Ryle (who had been to call on them), and then I asked if she were going to spend all her summer in Thorpe, and whether she didn’t miss
London in the season.</p>
<p>She said she wasn’t very fond of London, except for just a visit. She had spent all last winter there, for her sins, in the Penywern Road, by Earl’s Court station, and abominated it. Last summer they were at Dinan, in Brittany; very pretty, but rather odoriferous. They had an old house just outside the town, with a <em>perron</em> and firs all round.</p>
<p>And then the English colony there, who managed to make even the lawn-tennis malicious! Mrs. Pearce had quarrelled with them all in turn, and, as Mrs. Pearce usually did when she quarrelled with a whole society, declared there wasn’t a lady or a gentleman in the place.</p>
<p>She supposed they would go up to town, however, some time before the end of the season, and stay with her cousins in Lower Berkeley Street for a fortnight. But I could see she didn’t care much about going there. She said her cousins never thought of anything but getting young guardsmen to their dances and meeting them in the Row; they didn’t introduce her very readily, and tried to send her off
to concerts instead of taking her to balls, and they patronized her clothes, and asked their mother before her face to give her new gloves. They called it being kind to her, whereas it was really only a sort of ungracious patronage.</p>
<p>Evidently the cousins were merely a trio of conventional, metallic, would-be smart young ladies, who thought Ascot was heaven, and would stand for hours at the meet of the coaches.</p>
<p>She would have loved them readily enough if they had only showed her a little more heart; for, now I get closer to her, I see she seems of an enthusiastic nature, very ready to like and to love; but the cousins were wrapped up in themselves, and their quasi-fashion, and their grotesque efforts to make a smart marriage, and those kind of people are never loved. How can they be, if they are unlovable? And the last to like them even, as a rule, are their relations;
for, however successful socially, with them they are generally signal failures.</p>
<p>Cynic? Oh yes, of course; but then, you see, I know.</p>
<p>I asked politely after Mrs. Pearce, and Miss Fanny began to laugh at the discovery she had made that morning in Mrs. Pearce’s purse.</p>
<p>She had taken it to the post-office to get some stamps, and found it contained (besides the usual keys, sticking-plaster, and specimens of trimming) cuttings from the newspaper of a cure for the cholera, ditto for the influenza, the numbers of some missing foreign bonds and of a quantity of £1000 bank-notes recently stolen from a city bank.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pearce says you never can tell when a stolen foreign bond, or the cholera, or a £1000 bank-note mayn’t come your way even in Thorpe; for instance, be given you in change at the butcher’s. When
they do, she proposes to be ready for them all.</p>
<p>In Mrs. Pearce I confess I didn’t like to show too much interest, for, among the revelations of last night (notwithstanding her liking for him) Mr. Banquier had mercilessly included facts about her early
history, too.</p>
<p>She had married, not very young, a raffish, rackety captain of lancers, and after a period of extreme trial and discomfort had been driven to divorce him. Deprived of a wife’s care (and nagging) the captain had dropped through the regulation, ex-military stages of wine and coal merchant. Those employments failing him, and for some few years entirely dependent on new matrimonial charity (for he had
straightway married again), he had only recently been forced to make an appearance in the police-court as prosecutor against his wife (<em>ci-devant</em> boarding-house proprietress), whose bitter humor it was to beat the poor old man about the head with the tongs. He was a handsome old gentleman, with the venerable head and white beard of a minor prophet, and told so plaintive and judicious a tale in the witness-box of continued ill-usage, that the Hornsey magistrate could not do less than give the lady six months’ real imprisonment in a real jail.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pearce heard of the sentence, according to Mr. Banquier, with very mingled feelings; delight that the captain had been soundly beaten; anger and regret that another woman had done it; apprehension as to what might occur when the wife came out,
whether she might not come and pay her a visit in Thorpe with the shovel.</p>
<p>Meantime the captain—still gay, bless him!—had, immediately on his wife’s being safe in jail, broken up the Hornsey bower and fled, not unaccompanied, to the retired neighborhood of the Uxbridge Road.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed! there appears to be always some trusting female found ready on the spot to console your superannuated man about town. Sometimes it’s <em>une ancienne</em>, who happens to be free; sometimes <em>une nouvelle</em>, who cheerfully discards her present obligations.</p>
<p>For the captain’s sake! Irresistible, the British officer and gentleman—even in decay.</p>
<p>And now we were at the entrance to the Redan, and though I believe Miss Fanny would rather have gone in alone, on the chance of a word with Mr. Banquier, I went on with her sturdily down to her
little gate. I’d the dim idea I was the better discharging, on the recommendation of the major, the office of elder brother to her.</p>
<p>It was just dark, drawing on for nine, and, except for No. 5, none of the little houses were lighted. No. 13’s windows were wide open, as though the rooms were yawning after the labor of the day.</p>
<p>Miss Fanny’s heart sank a little; I could tell it by the fall in the tones of her voice. It would have been something to know he was there, only just across the Redan. But it was all dark and silent.</p>
<p>Evidently Mr. Banquier is trying her, making himself missed. She let me know in a sad little fashion she hadn’t seen him all day.</p>
<p>I can see she fears he is beginning to get tired of her, is keeping purposely out of her way. She fears she scarcely knows what; only she knows that, after the early feeling of security, she is beginning to doubt, to be miserable.</p>
<p>And yet all the way, till just as we got into Thorpe, she had been quite bright and merry.</p>
<p>How appalling is the power of dissimulation in even the frankest woman, and yet how necessary! I am amazed sometimes, at a London “At-home,” looking round on all the people, listening to their chatter. There’s scarcely a heart there, man’s or woman’s, that isn’t wrung with grief and disappointment, and loss of one kind or another; there’s scarcely a woman in the room who isn’t acrid because she isn’t loved at all, or not loved by the right man, or not well enough by him. And yet they cackle with quite apparent cheerfulness about the theatre and the pictures and their parties, as though their inner life had really no existence.</p>
<p>Heaven knows, I don’t complain; I only think it wonderful.</p>
<p>Oh, love—love and desire! how many hearts are aching, throbbing, breaking this very moment as I scrawl these few lines.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chick looks at me as she clears away supper and says, with staid disapproval, “Writing again, sir?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mrs. Chick, writing again.”</p>
<p>Then she considerately suggests I shall get to bed early, so as to be in good trim for the cricket-match to-morrow.</p>
<p>Dear me! I forgot all about the cricket-match to-morrow, and I haven’t had a bat in my hand for two years.</p>

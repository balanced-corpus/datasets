<!-- CHAPTER IX. <br>AT CHICAGO. -->
<p>Mr. Peacocke went on alone to San Francisco from the Ogden
Junction, and there obtained full information on the matter which
had brought him upon this long and disagreeable journey.  He had
no difficulty in obtaining the evidence which he required.  He had
not been twenty-four hours in the place before he was, in truth,
standing on the stone which had been placed over the body of
Ferdinand Lefroy, as he had declared to Robert Lefroy that he
would stand before he would be satisfied.  On the stone was cut
simply the names, Ferdinand Lefroy of Kilbrack, Louisiana; and to
these were added the dates of the days on which the man had been
born and on which he died.  Of this stone he had a photograph
made, of which he took copies with him; and he obtained also from
the minister who had buried the body and from the custodian who
had charge of the cemetery certificates of the interment.  Armed
with these he could no longer doubt himself, or suppose that
others would doubt, that Ferdinand Lefroy was dead.</p>

<p>Having thus perfected his object, and feeling but little interest
in a town to which he had been brought by such painful
circumstances, he turned round, and on the second day after his
arrival, again started for Chicago. Had it been possible, he would
fain have avoided any further meeting with Robert Lefroy.  Short
as had been his stay at San Francisco he had learnt that Robert,
after his brother’s death, had been concerned in buying mining
shares and paying for them with forged notes.  It was not supposed
that he himself had been engaged in the forgery, but that he had
come into the city with men who had been employed for years on
this operation, and had bought shares and endeavoured to sell them
on the following day.  He had, however, managed to leave the place
before the police had got hold of him, and had escaped, so that no
one had been able to say at what station he had got upon the
railway. Nor did any one in San Francisco know where Robert
Lefroy was now to be found.  His companions had been taken, tried,
and convicted, and were now in the State prison,—where also would
Robert Lefroy soon be if any of the officers of the State could
get hold of him. Luckily Mr. Peacocke had said little or nothing
of the man in making his own inquiries.  Much as he had hated and
dreaded the man; much as he had suffered from his
companionship,—good reason as he had to dislike the whole
family,—he felt himself bound by their late companionship not to
betray him.  The man had assisted Mr. Peacocke simply for money;
but still he had assisted him.  Mr. Peacocke therefore held his
peace and said nothing.  But he would have been thankful to have
been able to send the money that was now due to him without having
again to see him.  That, however, was impossible.</p>

<p>On reaching Chicago he went to an hotel far removed from that
which Lefroy had designated.  Lefroy had explained to him
something of the geography of the town, and had explained that for
himself he preferred a “modest, quiet hotel.” The modest, quiet
hotel was called Mrs. Jones’s boarding-house, and was in one of
the suburbs far from the main street.  “You needn’t say as you’re
coming to me,” Lefroy had said to him; “nor need you let on as you
know anything of Mrs. Jones at all.  People are so curious; and it
may be that a gentleman sometimes likes to lie <i>perdu</i>.” Mr.
Peacocke, although he had but small sympathy for the taste of a
gentleman who likes to lie <i>perdu</i>, nevertheless did as he was
bid, and found his way to Mrs. Jones’s boarding-house without
telling any one whither he was going.</p>

<p>Before he started he prepared himself with a thousand dollars in
bank-notes, feeling that this wretched man had earned them in
accordance with their compact.  His only desire now was to hand
over the money as quickly as possible, and to hurry away out of
Chicago.  He felt as though he himself were almost guilty of some
crime in having to deal with this man, in having to give him money
secretly, and in carrying out to the end an arrangement of which
no one else was to know the details.  How would it be with him if
the police of Chicago should come upon him as a friend, and
probably an accomplice, of one who was “wanted” on account of
forgery at San Francisco?  But he had no help for himself, and at
Mrs. Jones’s he found his wife’s brother-in-law seated in the bar
of the public-house,—that everlasting resort for American
loungers,—with a cigar as usual stuck in his mouth, loafing away
his time as only American frequenters of such establishments know
how to do.  In England such a man would probably be found in such
a place with a glass of some alcoholic mixture beside him, but
such is never the case with an American.  If he wants a drink he
goes to the bar and takes it standing,—will perhaps take two or
three, one after another; but when he has settled himself down to
loafe, he satisfies himself with chewing a cigar, and covering a
circle around him with the results.  With this amusement he will
remain contented hour after hour;—nay, throughout the entire day
if no harder work be demanded of him.  So was Robert Lefroy found
now.  When Peacocke entered the hall or room the man did not rise
from his chair, but accosted him as though they had parted only an
hour since.  “So, old fellow, you’ve got back all alive.”</p>

<p>“I have reached this place at any rate.”</p>

<p>“Well; that’s getting back, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“I have come back from San Francisco.”</p>

<p>“H’sh!” exclaimed Lefroy, looking round the room, in which,
however, there was no one but themselves.  “You needn’t tell
everybody where you’ve been.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to conceal.”</p>

<p>“That is more than anybody knows of himself.  It’s a good maxim to
keep your own affairs quiet till they’re wanted.  In this country
everybody is spry enough to learn all about everything.  I never
see any good in letting them know without a reason.  Well;—what
did you do when you got there?”</p>

<p>“It was all as you told me.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I say so?  What was the good of bringing me all this way,
when, if you’d only believed me, you might have saved me the
trouble.  Ain’t I to be paid for that?”</p>

<p>“You are to be paid.  I have come here to pay you.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you owe for the knowledge.  But for coming?  Ain’t I
to be paid extra for the journey?”</p>

<p>“You are to have a thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“H’sh!—you speak of money as though every one has a business to
know that you have got your pockets full.  What’s a thousand
dollars, seeing all that I have done for you!”</p>

<p>“It’s all that you’re going to get.  It’s all, indeed, that I have
got to give you.”</p>

<p>“Gammon.”</p>

<p>“It’s all, at any rate, that you’re going to get.  Will you have
it now?”</p>

<p>“You found the tomb, did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I found the tomb.  Here is a photograph of it.  You can keep
a copy if you like it.”</p>

<p>“What do I want of a copy,” said the man, taking the photograph in
his hand.  “He was always more trouble than he was worth,—was
Ferdy.  It’s a pity she didn’t marry me.  I’d ‘ve made a woman of
her.” Peacocke shuddered as he heard this, but he said nothing.
“You may as well give us the picter;—it’ll do to hang up
somewhere if ever I have a room of my own.  How plain it is.
Ferdinand Lefroy,—of Kilbrack!  Kilbrack indeed! It’s little
either of us was the better for Kilbrack.  Some of them
psalm-singing rogues from New England has it now;—or perhaps a
right-down nigger.  I shouldn’t wonder.  One of our own lot,
maybe!  Oh; that’s the money, is it?—A thousand dollars; all that
I’m to have for coming to England and telling you, and bringing
you back, and showing you where you could get this pretty picter
made.” Then he took the money, a thick roll of notes, and crammed
them into his pocket.</p>

<p>“You’d better count them.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t worth the while with such a trifle as that.”</p>

<p>“Let me count them then.”</p>

<p>“You’ll never have that plunder in your fists again, my fine
fellow.”</p>

<p>“I do not want it.”</p>

<p>“And now about my expenses out to England, on purpose to tell you
all this.  You can go and make her your wife now,—or can leave
her, just as you please.  You couldn’t have done neither if I
hadn’t gone out to you.”</p>

<p>“You have got what was promised.”</p>

<p>“But my expenses,—going out?”</p>

<p>“I have promised you nothing for your expenses going out,—and
will pay you nothing.”</p>

<p>“You won’t?”</p>

<p>“Not a dollar more.”</p>

<p>“You won’t?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.  I do not suppose that you expect it for a moment,
although you are so persistent in asking for it.”</p>

<p>“And you think you’ve got the better of me, do you?  You think
you’ve carried me along with you, just to do your bidding and take
whatever you please to give me?  That’s your idea of me?”</p>

<p>“There was a clear bargain between us. I have not got the better
of you at all.”</p>

<p>“I rather think not, Peacocke.  I rather think not.  You’ll have
to get up earlier before you get the better of Robert Lefroy.  You
don’t expect to get this money back again,—do you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,—any more than I should expect a pound of meat out
of a dog’s jaw.” Mr. Peacocke, as he said this, was waxing angry.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you do;—but you expected that I was to earn it
by doing your bidding;—didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“And you have.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have; but how?  You never heard of my cousin, did
you;—Ferdinand Lefroy of Kilbrack, Louisiana?”</p>

<p>“Heard of whom?”</p>

<p>“My cousin; Ferdinand Lefroy.  He was very well known in his own
State, and in California too, till he died.  He was a good fellow,
but given to drink.  We used to tell him that if he would marry it
would be better for him;—but he never would;—he never did.”
Robert Lefroy as he said this put his left hand into his
trousers-pocket over the notes which he had placed there, and drew
a small revolver out of his pocket with the other hand.  “I am
better prepared now,” he said, “than when you had your six-shooter
under your pillow at Leavenworth.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe a word of it.  It’s a lie,” said Peacocke.</p>

<p>“Very well.  You’re a chap that’s fond of travelling, and have got
plenty of money.  You’d better go down to Louisiana and make your
way straight from New Orleans to Kilbrack.  It ain’t above forty
miles to the south-west, and there’s a rail goes within fifteen
miles of it.  You’ll learn there all about Ferdinand Lefroy as was
our cousin,—him as never got married up to the day he died of
drink and was buried at San Francisco.  They’ll be very glad, I
shouldn’t wonder, to see that pretty little picter of yours,
because they was always uncommon fond of cousin Ferdy at Kilbrack.
And I’ll tell you what; you’ll be sure to come across my brother
Ferdy in them parts, and can tell him how you’ve seen me.  You can
give him all the latest news, too, about his own wife.  He’ll be
glad to hear about her, poor woman.” Mr. Peacocke listened to this
without saying a word since that last exclamation of his.  It
might be true.  Why should it not be true?  If in truth there had
been these two cousins of the same name, what could be more likely
than that his money should be lured out of him by such a fraud as
this?  But yet,—yet, as he came to think of it all, it could not
be true.  The chance of carrying such a scheme to a successful
issue would have been too small to induce the man to act upon it
from the day of his first appearance at Bowick.  Nor was it
probable that there should have been another Ferdinand Lefroy
unknown to his wife; and the existence of such a one, if known to
his wife, would certainly have been made known to him.</p>

<p>“It’s a lie,” said he, “from beginning to end.”</p>

<p>“Very well; very well.  I’ll take care to make the truth known by
letter to Dr. Wortle and the Bishop and all them pious swells over
there.  To think that such a chap as you, a minister of the
gospel, living with another man’s wife and looking as though
butter wouldn’t melt in your mouth!  I tell you what; I’ve got a
little money in my pocket now, and I don’t mind going over to
England again and explaining the whole truth to the Bishop myself.
I could make him understand how that photograph ain’t worth
nothing, and how I explained to you myself as the lady’s righteous
husband is all alive, keeping house on his own property down in
Louisiana. Do you think we Lefroys hadn’t any place beside
Kilbrack among us?”</p>

<p>“Certainly you are a liar,” said Peacocke.</p>

<p>“Very well.  Prove it.”</p>

<p>“Did you not tell me that your brother was buried at San
Francisco?”</p>

<p>“Oh, as for that, that don’t matter.  It don’t count for much
whether I told a crammer or not.  That picter counts for nothing.
It ain’t my word you were going on as evidence.  You is able to
prove that Ferdy Lefroy was buried at ‘Frisco.  True enough.  I
buried him.  I can prove that.  And I would never have treated you
this way, and not have said a word as to how the dead man was only
a cousin, if you’d treated me civil over there in England.  But
you didn’t.”</p>

<p>“I am going to treat you worse now,” said Peacocke, looking him in
the face.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do now?  It’s I that have the revolver this
time.” As he said this he turned the weapon round in his hand.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to shoot you,—nor yet to frighten you, as I did in
the bed-room at Leavenworth.  Not but what I have a pistol too.”
And he slowly drew his out of his pocket.  At this moment two men
sauntered in and took their places in the further corner of the
room.  “I don’t think there is to be any shooting between us.”</p>

<p>“There may,” said Lefroy.</p>

<p>“The police would have you.”</p>

<p>“So they would—for a time.  What does that matter to me?  Isn’t a
fellow to protect himself when a fellow like you comes to him
armed?”</p>

<p>“But they would soon know that you are the swindler who escaped
from San Francisco eighteen months ago.  Do you think it wouldn’t
be found out that it was you who paid for the shares in forged
notes?”</p>

<p>“I never did.  That’s one of your lies.”</p>

<p>“Very well.  Now you know what I know; and you had better tell me
over again who it is that lies buried under the stone that’s been
photographed there.”</p>

<p>“What are you men doing with them pistols?” said one of the
strangers, walking across the room, and standing over the backs of
their chairs.</p>
<!-- This observation was in the Project Gutenberg text: Example of inconsistent ‘a-verbing.’ This example is not hyphenated. One other is hyphenated (‘a-going’) and the

<p>“We are alooking at ‘em,” said Lefroy.</p>
<!-- This observation was in the Project Gutenberg text: Example of inconsistent ‘a-verbing.’ This example is not hyphenated. One other is hyphenated (‘a-going’) and the
third is not (‘alooking’). -->
<p>“If you’re agoing to do anything of that kind you’d better go and
do it elsewhere,” said the stranger.</p>

<p>“Just so,” said Lefroy.  “That’s what I was thinking myself.”</p>

<p>“But we are not going to do anything,” said Mr. Peacocke.  “I have
not the slightest idea of shooting the gentleman; and he has just
as little of shooting me.”</p>

<p>“Then what do you sit with ‘em out in your hands in that fashion
for?” said the stranger.  “It’s a decent widow woman as keeps this
house, and I won’t see her set upon.  Put ‘em up.” Whereupon
Lefroy did return his pistol to his pocket,—upon which Mr.
Peacocke did the same.  Then the stranger slowly walked back to
his seat at the other side of the room.</p>

<p>“So they told you that lie; did they,—at ‘Frisco?” asked Lefroy.</p>

<p>“That was what I heard over there when I was inquiring about your
brother’s death.”</p>

<p>“You’d believe anything if you’d believe that.”</p>

<p>“I’d believe anything if I’d believe in your cousin.” Upon this
Lefroy laughed, but made no further allusion to the romance which
he had craftily invented on the spur of the moment.  After that
the two men sat without a word between them for a quarter of an
hour, when the Englishman got up to take his leave.  “Our business
is over now,” he said, “and I will bid you good-bye.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’m athinking,” said Lefroy.  Mr. Peacocke
stood with his hand ready for a final adieu, but he said nothing.
“I’ve half a mind to go back with you to England.  There ain’t
nothing to keep me here.”</p>

<p>“What could you do there?”</p>

<p>“I’d be evidence for you, as to Ferdy’s death, you know.”</p>

<p>“I have evidence.  I do not want you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go, nevertheless.”</p>

<p>“And spend all your money on the journey.”</p>

<p>“You’d help;—wouldn’t you now?”</p>

<p>“Not a dollar,” said Peacocke, turning away and leaving the room.
As he did so he heard the wretch laughing loud at the excellence
of his own joke.</p>

<p>Before he made his journey back again to England he only once more
saw Robert Lefroy.  As he was seating himself in the railway car
that was to take him to Buffalo the man came up to him with an
affected look of solicitude.  “Peacocke,” he said, “there was only
nine hundred dollars in that roll.”</p>

<p>“There were a thousand.  I counted them half-an-hour before I
handed them to you.”</p>

<p>“There was only nine hundred when I got ‘em.”</p>

<p>“There were all that you will get.  What kind of notes were they
you had when you paid for the shares at ‘Frisco?” This question he
asked out loud, before all the passengers.  Then Robert Lefroy
left the car, and Mr. Peacocke never saw him or heard from him
again.</p>

<!-- Volume 3 Chapter 5 -->
<p>In one of the most desolate parts of the country of Poland, there were vast estates of the Princes Zouroff, conferred on them at the time of the partition of that unhappy land between Christian sovereigns. They were vast, lonely districts, with villages few and scantily populated; immense plains of grain and grass, and swamps of reedy wildernesses, and dim, sandy forests of pines, straight, and colourless, and mournful.</p>
<p>In the heart of all these—whose yield made up no slight sum in the immense riches of the Russian Princes who owned them, and spent their produce on the pavement of Paris and St. Petersburg—there stood a large, lofty building, which had been once a fortified monastery, and had served for a century as the scarcely ever visited castle of the Zouroffs.</p>
<p>It was of immense extent. It had no architectural beauty; and, from its many narrow windows there was no outlook except on one side to the interminable woods of pine, and on the other over the plains and marshes, through which a sullen, yellow river crept. Within, it was decorated as it had been decorated by Ivan Zouroff at the time of the abdication of Stanislas Augustus; Zouroff having hanged the peasants on the pine trees, and made the corn-lands red, before sunset and harvest-time, with blood, and in such wise pleased his imperial mistress.</p>
<p>From the gay, gorgeous interior, and the sunlit gardens and sea terraces of the Norman château, Sergius Zouroff sent his wife to this place, amidst the desolation of a province, then bleeding afresh from the terrorism that strove to stamp out the Nihilists.</p>
<p>Vere left Félicité without protest. Félicité was hers by settlement, but she did not urge that fact. She accepted the commands of her husband, and travelled across Europe in almost unbroken silence, accompanied by the attendants he had selected, by her women, and by the dog Loris.</p>
<p>When she had read her husband’s letter, her first impulse had been to refuse, and to disobey him; to go away with her own jewels, and no single thing of his, and gain her own bread in some way in solitude, as she had intended to do if Jeanne de Sonnaz had remained in her house. Then, on later and calmer thought, she accepted the banishment to Poland. Her pride made her willing to avoid all scandal, her principle made her deem it still right to obey her husband. She had asked him once to let her live on his estates, out of the world; she considered she had the request granted, though in a savage and bitter way. As to the condition that he made her return dependent on—she lifted her head, and drew herself erect, with the haughty resolve that she was capable of when stung and roused. Sooner than receive Jeanne de Sonnaz in her house, or ever salute her as a friend, she said to herself that she would live and die on the Polish plains. She did not answer; she did not protest or rebuke; she neither wrote nor spoke to her husband in the fortnight that followed; she entertained her guests with her usual calm, cold grace, and when the last of them had left, and the day of her departure arrived, she went away tranquilly, as though she went of her own will, and in her own way, taking the dog Loris.</p>
<p>Zouroff had not been surprised.</p>
<p>Though he could ill appreciate her character, he did not misunderstand it. “She may break, she will never bend,” he thought, as careful always of the outside observances of courtesy, he bade her a courtly farewell before his household.</p>
<p>“I am his prisoner!” she thought, as a week later she entered the austere gloom of Szarisla. But sooner than release herself on the terms he offered, she said in her heart that Poland should be her tomb, as it had been that of so many martyrs. Martyrs to an idea, the world said of those. It would have said the same of her.</p>
<p>To her mother, and her friends, and all society, Sergius Zouroff explained that his wife had long asked him to allow her to pass some months on his northern estates, to establish a school, and improve the moral condition of the peasantry, and at last he had consented; it was an insanity, he added, but an innocent one; she was a saint.</p>
<p>“Alas! alas! what has happened?” thought his sister, “what has happened? Oh, why was I not at Félicité!”</p>
<p>But she was the only one who feared or wondered—the Princess Vera had always been so strange; and she was a saint.</p>
<p>To Jeanne de Sonnaz alone Zouroff said, with his gloomy eyes full of sombre ferocity, “<i>Je vous venge</i>.”</p>
<p>To her sister-in-law, and to the few to whom she ever wrote, Vera said always, in her brief letters, “I am tired of the world, as you know; I am glad of this retreat. It is desolate, and very dull, but it is peace.”</p>
<p>Madame Nelaguine, with her eyes sparkling with rage, and all her little person erect in indignant dignity, reproached her brother in a torrent of rebuke and censure. “I imagine very well what happened,” she said to him. “You would have Jeanne de Sonnaz under the same roof with Vere.”</p>
<p>“Respect my friend’s name,” said Zouroff, with savage authority, “or you and I never meet again. Vere is a saint, you say. Well, she has her wish; she goes into retreat. Would it please you better if she were living with Corrèze?”</p>
<p>“Corrèze—he is nothing to her!” said Madame Nelaguine hotly.</p>
<p>Zouroff shrugged his shoulders. “Some think otherwise,” he answered.</p>
<p>“You are a brute, and you are a coward—a malignant coward!” said his sister. “You outrage your wife in every way, and you must even dare to soil her innocence with suspicion.”</p>
<p>“If it be suspicion only time will show,” said Zouroff. “Go and live at Szarisla yourself, if you pity my wife so much.”</p>
<p>But Madame Nelaguine, who loved the world, and could not live without its excitements and its intrigues, could not face that captivity in the Polish plain, though all the heart she had in her yearned towards her brother’s wife.</p>
<p>“Will you imprison her all her life?” she cried.</p>
<p>Zouroff answered with impatience and fatigue, “She will remain there until she receives my friend with respect.”</p>
<p>“You are a brute,” said his sister once more.</p>
<p>“I protect Jeanne, and I avenge her,” said Zouroff obstinately. He fancied that his honour was involved in the defence of his mistress.</p>
<p>“Jeanne!” echoed his sister with unutterable scorn. “You might as well defend and avenge your quadroon.”</p>
<p>But she knew very well that she might as well seek to shake the Ural mountains at their base as change the obstinacy of her brother.</p>
<p>Jeanne de Sonnaz had gained the empire over him of a re-awakened passion; the empire of a strong woman over an indolent man; of a mistress once deserted, and so doubly tenacious of her hold. There was no beauty in her, and no youth; but she had the secret of dominion over men. She cowed this tyrant, she subdued this man, who, to the self-will of long self-indulgence, had the moral feebleness and inertness of the Slav temperament; she railed at him, jeered at him, commanded him, yet fascinated him. He knew her to be worthless, faithless, never wholly his, nor wholly any one’s, yet she held him. “After all, she is the woman I have loved best,” he said to himself; and believed it, because she had the gift of exciting all that was worst in him, and subduing his fierce impulses to her own will and whim.</p>
<p>When he had married, Jeanne de Sonnaz, who beyond all things valued her position, and loved the world, had kept her peace because she did not choose to jeopardize her name, or gain the ridicule of her society. But she had always said to herself, “<i>Je</i> <i>me vengerai</i>.”</p>
<p>She kept her word.</p>
<p>Vere was in her captivity at Szarisla; and the Duchesse de Sonnaz—moving from one château to another, and entertaining circles of guests for the shooting at their own mighty place of Ruilhières—said easily in the ear of the two or three great ladies who were her most intimate associates, that there had been a scene at Félicité; she had tried to mediate between her old friend and his wife, but vainly, so far as peace went; Zouroff had forbidden the Princess to receive Corrèze, and Corrèze had been found there at evening in the gardens; oh, there was nothing serious—Vera was a young saint—but all the same there had been a scene, and Zouroff had sent his wife to Szarisla.</p>
<p>Then the two or three whom she told told others, and so the tale ran, and grew as it ran, and was believed. The world was satisfied that the Princess Zouroff was in penitence in Poland.</p>
<p>“I think they were lovers many years ago. I remember, when she was a mere child, seeing her in a boat with Corrèze; she had come from Havre with him; her mother was distracted. I suppose Zouroff and the Nelaguine knew nothing of it,” said the Princess Hélène Olgarousky, who made one of the brilliant autumn party at Ruilhières where Zouroff was not.</p>
<p>“Be sensible, <i>mon ami</i>,” had said the Duchesse Jeanne; “now your wife is away I cannot receive you—it would not do. Oh, in winter, when we are all in Paris again, you may come and see Paul as usual. But stay at Ruilhières you will not; no—no—no. Three times, No!”</p>
<p>She had no beauty, and no youth, she had no heart, and no conscience; she had been his friend for fifteen years, and he usually tired of any woman in less than fifteen days. Yet Sergius Zouroff chafed at the interdiction to stay at Ruilhières, as though he were eighteen, and she seen but an hour before; and found himself waiting with impatience for the moment of his return to Paris, with a vague sense that without this woman life was stupid, empty, and purposeless.</p>
<p>He missed the goad to his senses and his temper with which she knew so well how to guide him, as the tamed elephant turned loose misses the prick of the mahout’s steel. But she, who knew that the elephant too long left to himself turns wild, and comes never again to his mahout’s call, took care not to leave Zouroff too much to himself. When the first shooting-party broke up at Ruilhières, she left Duc Paul with some men to slay the pheasants, and went, for the sake of little Claire, who was not strong, to Arcachon and to Biarritz.</p>
<p>There Zouroff went occasionally when she would allow him. He went alone. He would no more have dared to take the mulattress or any other newer toy within sight of Jeanne de Sonnaz now, than he would have dared to take them into his Tsarina’s presence.</p>
<p>He had insulted his wife, but he dared not insult his mistress. She spoke to him often of his wife.</p>
<p>“You cannot keep Vera in Poland all winter,” she said one day in the fragrant alleys of Arcachon while Berthe and Claire played before them with little silk balloons.</p>
<p>“I shall do so,” he said gloomily.</p>
<p>“Impossible! They will call you a tyrant, an ogre, a fiend. You must have her in Paris.”</p>
<p>“Not unless she receives you.”</p>
<p>“Do not make me ridiculous, I beg of you,” she said with some impatience. “You mean,—if she will consent not to receive Corrèze.”</p>
<p>Zouroff was silent. He knew that he did not mean that. But it was the fiction which his ruler had set up between them.</p>
<p>“That is why you have sent her to Szarisla,” continued Jeanne de Sonnaz. “All the world knows that, though of course we put a fair face on it. The idea of talking of her not receiving me. If she did not receive me, Paul would have to shoot you, which would have its inconveniences—for you and Paul.”</p>
<p>She laughed a little, and impaled a blue butterfly on the sharp point of her tortoiseshell cone. Zouroff still said nothing; a sort of vague remorse touched him for a moment, as little Claire, whose balloon was entangled in a shrub, cried out, “Where is the princess? Why is she never with us now? She would get down my balloon. You are too cross.”</p>
<p>Zouroff released the toy, and said roughly, “Run to your sister, Claire, you tease us.”</p>
<p>“Madame Vera never said I teased,” said the child sullenly, with a pout, as she obeyed, and joined her elder sister.</p>
<p>“Where is Corrèze?” said her mother.</p>
<p>“<i>Nom empesté</i>!” swore Zouroff, “how should I know where a singer may be?”</p>
<p>“It is very easy to know where a great singer is. Comets are watched and chronicled. He was shooting in Styria, at Prince Hohenlohe’s, last month. Why do you not know? Do you have no reports from Szarisla?”</p>
<p>“He is not there,” said Zouroff angrily. He hated his wife, but he was jealous of her honour, even though it would, in a sense, have gratified him to be able to say to her, “You are no higher than the rest.”</p>
<p>“He may not be there,” said the Duchesse de Sonnaz carelessly. “On the other hand, it is not very far from Styria to Poland, and he is singing nowhere in public this autumn. Are your reports to be trusted?”</p>
<p>“Ivan would tell me anything,” said Zouroff moodily. “He writes me weekly of her health; he says nothing happens; no one goes—”</p>
<p>“Ivan is incorruptible, no doubt,” said Jeanne de Sonnaz, a little drily.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You are always asking me what I mean? I am no Sphinx, my dear friend, I am very transparent. I mean, that since your wife is there, it seems to me improbable that she does not, or will not, see Corrèze—”</p>
<p>Zouroff ground his heel on the turf with impatience, but he kept silent.</p>
<p>“I think it would be worth your while to make sure that she does not see Corrèze. I am quite aware that if they do meet, it will be merely a knight meeting a saint,—</p>
<div>
<p>
Pauvres couples, à l’âme haute,<br>
Qu’une noble horreur de la faute<br>
Empêche seule d’être heureux.<br>
</p>
</div>
<p>and that he will—<br>
<div>
<p>
Baise sa main sans la presser:<br>
Comme un lis facile à blesser<br>
Qui tremble à la moindre secousse—<br>
</p>
</div>
<p>and all the rest. But still—if only as a moral phenomenon, it might be worth watching, and Ivan, on whom you depend, is, though a very superior servant, still only a servant.”</p>
<p>“What would you have me do? Go myself?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think you should go yourself. It would prevent people saying unpleasant things or untrue ones. You must have your wife back in Paris, or you must be very certain of all that passes at Szarisla, or you may be made to play a foolish part—a part you would not like to play, when you have shut your wife up in it for her safety.”</p>
<p>“Jeanne,” said Zouroff gloomily, with his eyes fixed on the turf they were treading. “There is no one to hear, and we may speak as we mean; Vera does not return to me until she consents to receive you; there is no question of her honour; she will have that intact as if she were in a convent; she is made like that; she is no ‘lis <i>facile à blesser,’</i> she is made of steel. She knows everything, and she will no longer know you. To protect your name I exile her. She may live and die in Poland.”</p>
<p>She heard him, knowing very well that he said the simple fact, yet her eyes grew angry, and her teeth shut tight.</p>
<p>“You are all imbeciles, you Russians,” she said contemptuously. “You have only one remedy for all diseases—Siberia! It does not cure all diseases; Nihilism shows that. Corrèze is your best friend since you want to be free.”</p>
<p>“If he set foot in Szarisla he shall be beaten with rods!”</p>
<p>Jeanne de Sonnaz, as they passed under the tamarisk trees, looked at him coldly, and crossed her hands lightly on her gold-headed cane as she leaned on it.</p>
<p>“On my word I do not understand you. Are you in love with your wife?”</p>
<p>“Jeanne!”</p>
<p>“I do not accept divided homage,” said his friend with close-shut teeth; “and jealously is a form of homage. Perhaps the truer form.”</p>
<p>“One may be jealous of one’s honour—”</p>
<p>“You have none,” said Jeanne de Sonnaz coolly. “Your wife told you so long ago. You have rank, but you have not honour. You do not know what it means. My poor Paul does, but then he is stupid and <i>arriéré</i>. I think if I told Paul to kill you, it might perhaps arrange things—and then how happy they would be, these—</p>
<div>
<p>Purs amants sur terre égarés!”</p>
</div>
<p>Zouroff looked at her fixedly; his face grew anxious, sullen, and pale.</p>
<p>“Jeanne, say out; what is it you want me to do?”</p>
<p>“I want to reconcile your wife and you, of course,” said Jeanne de Sonnaz, driving her cane through the yielding turf. “That, of course, first of all, if possible. If impossible, I would have you divorced from her. Things, as they are, are ridiculous; and,” she added, in a lower breath, as the children and their balloons drew near, running against the wind, “and they may in time compromise me, which I do not choose to permit.”</p>
<p>Zouroff understood what she required of him; and he felt a coward and a brute, as his sister had called him.</p>
<p>The lily might not be so easy to bruise, but it was easy to soil it.</p>
<p>“Corrèze is certainly in Styria,” she added, as the children joined them.</p>
<p>Zouroff stood looking down on the green turf and the bright blossoms of the asters with moody eyes; he was thinking—what beast of prey was ever so hard of grip, so implacable in appetite, as a cruel woman? And yet this woman held him.</p>
<p>He dared not disobey, because he could not bear to lose her.</p>
<p>That autumn day, so sunny, balmy, and radiant in the sheltered gardens and forests of Arcachon, was winter at Szarisla. Sudden storms and heavy falls of snow had made the forests bare, the plains white; the winds were hurricanes, the thermometer was at zero, and the wolves ranged the lonely plateaux and moorlands in bands, hungered and rash. Szarisla in autumn was colder and drearier than Félicité could ever be in mid-winter, and the great, bare pile of the castle buildings rose black and sombre from out the unbroken world of whiteness.</p>
<p>There was an equally unchangeable melancholy around; it was in the midst of a district intensely and bitterly national; the Princes Zouroff were amongst the most accursed names of Poland, and the few, far-scattered nobles who dwelt in the province would no more have crossed the threshold of Szarisla than they would have kissed the cheek of Mouravieff, or the foot of the Gospodar. Vere lived in absolute solitude, and knew that it was as virtually also a captivity as was ever that of Mary, or of Arabella, Stuart.</p>
<p>Of course she was the Princess Vera, the mistress of Szarisla nominally and actually, but none the less she knew that every hour was watched, that every word was listened to, and that, whilst there was obsequious deference to all her commands, yet, had she expressed a wish to leave the place, she would have been reverentially entreated to await the wishes of the Prince, and would not have a found a man in her stables bold enough to harness her horses for her flight.</p>
<p>She had arrived there late one evening, and, despite the fires, the lights, the torches in the courts, the large household assembled in the entrance, a chill like that of the catacombs seemed around her, and she had felt that living she entered a grave.</p>
<p>Szarisla was an absolute solitude. The nearest town was a three days’ journey of long, bad roads; and the town, when reached, was an obscure and miserable place. The peasantry were sullen and disaffected. The district was under the iron heel of a hated governor, and its scanty population was mute in useless and gloomy resentment. She had no friend, no society, no occupation save such as she chose to make for herself; she was waited upon with frigid ceremonial and etiquette, and she was conscious that she was watched incessantly. Many women would have lost their senses, their health, or both, in that bitter weariness of blank, chill, silent days.</p>
<p>Vere, whose childish training now stood her in fair stead and service, summoned all her courage, all her pride, and resisted the depression that was like a malady, the lassitude that might be the precursor of mental or bodily disease. She rode constantly, till the snow fell; when the snow came, and the frost, she had the wild young horses put in the sleigh, and drove for leagues through the pine woods, and over the moorlands. Air and movement were, she knew, the only true physicians. Little by little she made her way into the homes, and into the hearts of the suspicious and disaffected peasantry; it was slow work, and hard, and thankless, but she was not easily discouraged or rebuffed. She could do little, for she was met at all times in her wishes for charity by the adamantine barrier of “the prince forbids it;” she had no more power, as she bitterly realised, than if she had been his serf. But all that personal influence could do, she did; and that was not little. She was the first living creature who had borne the name of Zouroff that had not been loathed and cursed at Szarisla.</p>
<p>Personal beauty is a rare sorcery, and when the fair face of the Princess Vera looked on them through the falling snow in the forests, or the dim light of their own wood cabins, the people could not altogether shut their hearts to her, though she bore the accursed name.</p>
<p>She was very unhappy; wearily and hopelessly so, because she saw no possibility of any other life than the captivity here, or the yet more arduous captivity of the great world, and in her memory she always heard the song,</p>
<div>
<p>
Si vous saviez que je vous aime,<br>
Surtout si vous saviez comment!<br>
</p>
</div>
<p>But she would not let her sorrow and her pain make slaves of her.</p>
<p>The wild and frequent storms of wind and snow tried her most hardly, because they mewed her in those gloomy rooms, and sunless corridors, which had seen so much human tyranny and human woe, and the long, black nights, when only the howl of the hurricane and the howl of the wolves were heard, were very terrible; she would walk up and down the panelled rooms through those midnight hours, that seemed like an eternity, and wondered if her husband had wished to drive her mad that he had sent her here. Her French women left her, unable to bear the cold, the dreariness, the loneliness; she had only Russians and Poles about her. At times in those lonely, ghastly nights, made hideous by the moans of the beasts and the roar of the winds, she thought of the Opera-house of Paris; she thought of the face of Faust. Then in that emptiness and darkness of her life she began to realise that she loved Corrèze; began to understand all that she cost to him in pain and vain regret.</p>
<p>If she would receive Jeanne de Sonnaz she could go back; go back to the splendour, the colour, the light of life; go back to the world where Corrèze reigned, where his voice was heard, where his eyes would answer hers. But it never once occurred to her to yield.</p>
<p>Now and then the truth came to her mind that Sergius Zouroff had sent her to this solitude not only as a vengeance, but as a temptation. Then all the strength in her repelled the very memory of Corrèze.</p>
<p>“Would my husband make me like Jeanne de Sonnaz,” she thought with a shudder of disgust, “so that I may no longer have the right to scorn her?”</p>
<p>And she strove with all her might to keep her mind calm and clear, her body in health, her sympathies awake for other sorrows than her own.</p>
<p>She studied the dead languages, which she had half forgotten, with the old priest of Szarisla, and conjured away the visions that assailed her in those endless and horrible nights, with the sonorous cadence of the Greek poets; and in the daytime, when the frost had made the white world firm under foot, passed almost all the hours of light sending her fiery horses through the glittering and rarefied air.</p>
<p>So the months passed, and it was mid-winter. Letters and journals told her that the gay world went on its course, but to her it seemed as utterly alien as it could do to any worker in the depths of the salt or the quicksilver mines that supplied his wealth to Prince Zouroff. The world had already forgotten her. Society only said, “Princesse Vera is passing the winter in Poland; so eccentric; but she was always strange and a saint;” and then, with the usual little laugh, Society added, “There is something about Corrèze.”</p>
<p>But the world does not long talk, even calumniously, of what is absent.</p>
<p>Prince Zouroff was on the boulevards; he gave his usual great dinners; he played as usual at his clubs; he entered his horses as usual for great races; the world did not concern itself largely about his wife.</p>
<p>She was in Poland.</p>
<p>She committed the heaviest sin against Society, the only one it never pardons. She was absent. No one had even the consolation to think that she had her lover with her.</p>
<p>Corrèze was singing in Berlin.</p>
<p>Madame Nelaguine, forcing herself to do what she loathed, went across Europe in the cold, wet weather as swiftly as she could travel, and visited Szarisla.</p>
<p>She strove to persuade her sister-in-law to accept the inevitable, and return to the Hôtel Zouroff and such consolations as the great world and its homage could contain.</p>
<p>“Be reasonable, Vera,” she urged, with the tears standing in her keen, marmoset-like eyes. “My dear, society is made up of women like Jeanne de Sonnaz. Receive her, what does it matter? It is not as if you loved your husband, as if your heart were wounded. Receive her. What will it cost you? You need never even see her in intimacy. Go to her on her day, let her come to you on yours. Show yourself half an hour at her balls, let her show herself at yours. That is all. What does it amount to? what does it cost? Nothing.”</p>
<p>“Little, no doubt,” answered Vere. “Only—all one’s self-respect.”</p>
<p>And she was not changed or persuaded.</p>
<p>“I shall live and die here, very likely,” she said at last, weary of resistance. “It is as well as any other place. It is better than Paris. Your brother has sent me here to coerce me. Go back and tell him that force will not succeed with me. I am not a coward.”</p>
<p>Madame Nelaguine, grieved and yet impatient, shuddered, and left the bleakness and loneliness of Vere’s prison-house with relief, and hurried home to the world and its ways, and said impetuously and bitterly to her brother, “Do not darken my doors, Sergius, while your wife is shut in that gaol of ice. Do not come to me, do not speak to me. You are a brute. Would to heaven Jeanne de Sonnaz were your wife; then you would be dealt with aright! Are you mad? do you wish to make her faithless? Can you think she will bear such a life as that? Can you leave a woman as young as she without friends, lovers, children, and expect her to change to snow, like the country you shut her in?—are you mad? If she shame herself there any way—any way—can you blame her? Can you take a girl, a child, and teach her what the passions of men are, and then bid her lead a nun’s life just when she has reached the full splendour and force of her womanhood—?”</p>
<p>“She is a saint, you say,” he answered with a smile; and he and his sister never spoke from that hour. In the boudoir of the Faubourg St. Germain his friend knew well how to surround him with an influence which little by little isolated him, and alienated him from all who had the courage to speak of his wife.</p>
<p>Jeanne de Sonnaz had one set purpose, the purpose which she had let him see in her at Arcachon; and until she should succeed in it she suffered no hand but her own to guide him.</p>
<p>The lily might have a stem of steel, and never be bent; but it could be broken.</p>
<p>Soilless though it might remain in its solitude amidst the snow, it should be broken; she had said it in her soul.</p>
<p>“<i>Ce que femme veut, l’homme veut</i>,” was the proverb as her experience read it.</p>
<p>All that there had been of manliness in Sergius Zouroff’s nature resisted her still in this thing that she sought; he still had a faith in his wife that his anger against her did not change; in his eyes Vere was purity incarnate, and he could have laughed aloud in the face of suspicion. To ruin by open doubt and calumnious accusation a creature he knew to be sinless, seemed to him so vile that he could not bring himself to do an act so base.</p>
<p>He sent her into captivity, and he kept her there without mercy, but to hem her in with falsehood, to dishonour her by affected belief in her dishonour, was a lower deep than he could stoop to, even at the bidding of his mistress.</p>
<p>That her solitude was the sharpest and most terrible form of temptation he knew well, and he exposed her to it ruthlessly; willing she should fall, if to fall she chose. But whilst she was innocent, to assume and assert her guilty was what he would not do. Nay, there were even times, when the fatal drug of Jeanne de Sonnaz’s presence was not on him, that he himself realised that he was a madman, who cast away the waters of life for a draught of poison, a jewel for a stone.</p>
<p>But he thrust aside the thought as it arose. He had surrendered himself to the will of his mistress. He had put his wife away for ever.</p>

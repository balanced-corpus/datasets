<!--CHAPTER 35.<br>—A STRANGE REVELATION-->
<p>“Is Captain Fitzallan in?” asked Dr. Creasey, poking his head out of the window of the cab which had brought him up to the bar racks in Dublin, where “The Eagles” were then lying.</p>
<p>“Yessir,” answered the faithful Pinner, who was seldom for many minutes absent from the passages and doorways about his master’s quarters.</p> 
<p>Creasey jumped out of the cab and made his way hurriedly upstairs. He was determined to see Fitzallan, and feared that if he was recognized before he got into the room he might be stopped, or have the door slammed in his face. He rapped at it hastily, and was greeted with an indifferent “Come in.”</p>
<p>As soon as he set foot in the room, and the occupant saw who his visitor was, Captain Fitzallan sprang to his feet, with a whirlwind of passion rising in his bosom, and roared, in a voice of thunder, an inquiry as to what this double-dyed villain wanted.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, however, so broken and careless had the man become, his fury left him, and he sank back in his chair, before he was answered, with what was very nearly an air of listless or wearied indifference. The other noted the change almost as soon as it appeared, and he withheld his reply until the young officer had sunk again into his seat. Then he said, very calmly, for he had steadied his nerves, and regained all his old impudent courage, with a a strong dose of brandy, before he left his hotel,</p>
<!-- There is a misprint in the manuscript of the double "a" in the previous sentence-->
<p>“I want to have a few moments’ private’ conversation with you, Captain Fitzallan, and I hope you will listen to me with quietness, while I unfold my business.”</p>
<p>“Go on,” said the other, with a tone of perfect carelessness, and just as if he was speaking to his servant on the most ordinary matter of detail. — “Go on. I suppose you have spent all the money you plundered me of, and want more. You’ve had that paper you gave me, stolen again from my quarters, and, to say the truth, I’ve been expecting you.”</p>
<p>“I’m not a thief, nor the master of thieves.”</p>
<p>” Are you not? I thought you were both.”</p> 
<p>Creasey bit his lips. He would far sooner have been received with the hottest passion than with this listlessness of utter want of concern in what was going forward.</p>
<p>“I did not steal that paper, sir, and you have no right to say so.”</p> 
<p>“It doesn’t matter — it’s gone. I’ve expected you, as I said before. What do you want?”</p> 
<p>“Well — ahem! Do you mind my sitting down on this chair?”</p>
<p>“Not in the least. Lie down on the sofa if you like. It’s all the same to me. Only be quick with whatever you’ve got to say. I’m for duty very shortly.” And he began to trim his nails with a penknife lying on the table. The doctor sat down, and went on:</p>
<p>“Captain Fitzallan, I am sorry to tell you — really sorry, I can assure you — that I’ve made a grave mistake in your business — in the story, you know!”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know very well. In the story that I was the son of Private Smythe. Have you nothing else to tell me? I knew it was a d—d lie all along.”</p>
<p>“In some respects it was — in others not. I’ve been out to India since I saw you last, and — ahem! — it’s an awkward thing to tell.”</p>
<p>“Then don’t tell it.”</p>
<p>“I must. I heard in England — in Chorlbury, in fact — enough to excite my suspicions that I had gone on a false scent—”</p>
<p>“I know you did.”</p> 
<p>—”On a false scent altogether, and I determined to go out—”</p>
<p>“Your plunder having become exhausted.”</p>
<p>“These interruptions, Captain Fitzallan, may be intensely funny, but I fail to see the joke; and you’ll excuse my saying that, in business, they are singularly out of place and obstructive.”</p>
<p>“Never mind their fun — they’re <i>true</i>. How ever, get on with your speech; I’ll not interrupt you any more. Only pray be quick.”</p>
<p>“Well, I did go out, to Bombay, and thence I went to the mofussil, and to Calcutta, and a number of other places, picking up an item here, a proof there, a corroboration in the other place; and all has resulted in my obtaining and holding legal evidence, of such a strong nature as it will be impossible to refute that — in fact, to the effect — I mean, to prove to demonstration — that I was on the wrong scent as to who your real father was.”</p>
<p>The doctor had evidently expected that this statement would fall on the listener with all the crushing weight of a thunderbolt; but he was utterly mistaken, for, beyond a slight raising of the eyebrows, an instinctive gesture often made when people feel that they are expected to evince surprise, Fitzallan did not seem to take the slightest heed of what his informant was saying.</p>
<p>“Do you understand me, Captain Fitzallan? I say I was on the wrong scent as to who your real father was.”</p>
<p>“Understand you? —perfectly. And who, if it’s not an impertinent question, do you make me out to be this time?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you apprehend the gravity of the situation, sir. Are you aware that, if it can be proved you certainly were <i>not</i> correctly described in the will as Henry Koberts, you would lose the property you hold now?”</p>
<p>“So my solicitor says. Anything else?”</p>
<p>“Yes, plenty else. I can prove you are not Henry Roberts, nor Henry Smythe either, but some one very different indeed. The proofs are overwhelming, Captain Fitzallan — over whelming beyond all measure, and—”</p>
<p>“And,” said the other, rapidly, interrupting the doctor, but subsequently speaking very slowly, the while gazing at his opponent as though he would pierce his very soul — “and, Dr. Creasey, you want to see what bargain you can drive with me for again maintaining silence? You want me to buy you off, as I bought you off before? Is it not so?”</p>
<p>“It is so!” cried the other, in tones of the most brazen impudence; “it is so, if you choose to put it in that way. I throw off the mask altogether, and I declare that I will have a fixed annuity out of that property you enjoy, to the deprivation of the proper heir, for the holding of my tongue. Talk of robbing, and pretend to make me the object of your scorn and contempt! I fling it back in your face, Captain Fitzallan, and with interest! Where I’ve made a few dirty hundreds, or paltry thousands, you have robbed the rightful heir of tens and hundreds of thousands; and it is you who are the real rogue, not I!”</p>
<p>“Have you done?”</p>
<p>There was every appearance — and Creasey could not but regard it as only an appearance, well acted — of the most profound indifference on the part of the young officer; and, indeed, he yawned during the very height of Creasey’s indignant declaration of their being accomplices in a joint sort of robbery.</p>
<p>“Yes, Captain Fitzallan, I <i>have</i> done. But mark my words — I’m in earnest, and, before Heaven! this time there is no mistake, no shadow of error or duplicity — my version is absolute, undeniable fact; and if you do not accede to my terms, I swear to my Maker I will go straight to the real heir, and in three months’ time you will be a penniless pauper!”</p>
<p>He had worked himself up into a furious passion — just the very thing he had most desired to avoid, but for the life of him he was unable to control himself under the cutting, contemptuous indifference of this lost man before him. The latter, after a pause, during which the doctor glared at him with almost absorbing rage, then spoke just as calmly as he had been speaking all along.</p>
<p>“Dr. Creasey, I despise your threats just as I despise yourself. I’ll not give you one single farthing more in this world, under any consideration whatever; that’s my answer to you, my unqualified answer, and you may just take yourself away as quickly as you came, for, if you stayed here until midnight, you would hear nothing else from me.”</p>
<p>The doctor absolutely laughed out hysterically in his baffled rage and surprise.</p>
<p>“<i>That’s</i> your answer, Captain Fitzallan — your real, deliberate, and only answer?”</p>
<p>“That’s my answer — make the best of it. You will get no other, and may spare yourself the trouble of asking for it. And now, if you have nothing more to say, will you excuse me calling attention to the fact that there is the door?”</p>
<p>The utmost contempt, the coolest want of concern in the business under discussion, the almost entire absence of any interest whatever in this fellow, and in his schemes for further plunder, were evident in Captain Fitzallan’s manner as he rose and pointed to the entrance, and the doctor was fairly staggered by a reception that he had never even dreamed of. He had come prepared for an interview of the most stormy character; he thought it not altogether impossible that, on the spur of the moment, the enraged officer would have him expelled from the barracks with ignominy, or even might give him into custody on a charge which he could not sustain regarding the former transaction between them; but he had never imagined for one moment that he would be received with careless contempt, and an indifference that he now saw plainly enough was real, and not assumed. This course of conduct threw him out of his reckoning entirely, and for the moment he was completely nonplussed. But Dr. Creasey was by no means the manner of man to give up all hopes of victory because he was beaten in the preliminary skirmish, and he returned to the combat with renewed vigour.</p>
<p>“You do not seem to take my meaning, Captain Fitzallan. Do not deceive yourself into thinking that this affair is, like the last, founded on hearsay. The evidence I hold has been prepared by careful, wide-awake lawyers. It cannot be refuted, and, if I choose, you hold the Fitzallan property no longer than the few months necessary to comply with legal necessities, and bring the matter, merely <i>pro forma</i>, before the Courts.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, I quite understand it. If I don’t — and I don’t — consent to subsidise you, you place yourself in communication with the next heir. You prove that I am not Henry Eoberts, that I never was, that therefore the property has been willed to me with a flaw that cannot be got over, and that the next heir walks into it as a mere matter of course. That is so?”</p>
<p>“That <i>is</i> so. You have it exactly.”
<p>“Well, I’ve given you my answer — not one farthing more shall you have, if it was to save either your life or my own. What more do you want? My words are plain enough, and again I beg to tell you there lies the door. Be good enough to avail yourself of it. And, see, you needn’t trouble yourself to come here again. If you do, I shall have you removed by the guard.”</p>
<p>Dr. Creasey had become very nervous — in fact, he was beaten now, and he knew it. Still he had one shot in the locker that he thought might tell, and he proceeded to deliver it.</p>
<p>“Perhaps you would not be so cool if you knew all I know, Captain Fitzallan.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps not, but I’d chance it.”</p>
<p>“Who do you think your father really was?”</p>
<p>“Certainly not Private Smythe — that fact my instinct tells me. For the rest, I do not any longer care one brass button.”</p>
<p>“Sir, I will <i>make</i> you care!” cried the other, losing all self-control at being thus baffled by a man who, barely a year ago, was as plastic clay in his hands — “with two words I will make you care. Your father was a man you know well — too well for your own happiness.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Who was he, then? This grows amusing.”</p>
<p>“He was, and is, Colonel de Courcey Calverley!”</p>
<p>The young officer turned just a trifle pale as this mine was sprung upon him, but, in truth, he was far too much broken, too wretched in his bitter black despair at the loss of Lady Clara, to care much for, or even to feel much of the most astonishing circumstances the world could produce; and beyond a slight shock — a shock that but a year ago would have been powerful as some fearful earthquake — he hardly grasped the magnitude of the communication thus made by the villain before him.</p>
<p>“Ha!” he said, with something of a gasp, “that’s the latest version, is it ?”</p>
<p>Then there was a pause, during which the two men looked at one another, each expecting the other to speak, each determined to pursue his own course — Creasey that of driving a bargain for money, if human means could accomplish it; Fitzallan, that of allowing things connected with his history and prospects to proceed in their own way, with little or no assistance, or even attention from himself.</p>
<p>The doctor was the first to break silence:</p>
<p>“That’s the latest version, the absolutely truthful version, Captain Fitzallan. And now what have you got to say to me?”</p>
<p>“This. Have you proof — I mean strict, legal proof, that will stand the test of the Law Courts, of what you say?”</p>
<p>“As I told you before, I have the most undeniable proofs. The fact is as I tell you, and cannot for one half-hour be disputed.”</p>
<p>“Well” — there was coming again over Fitzallan that horrible, dreary indifference which now seemed to be with him even stronger than a second nature — “well, and what do you expect me to do?”</p>
<p>“Do, sir?” roared out the other in a rage — “do whatever the devil you like! But expect no mercy from me. I go straight away to — to the next heir, and before Autumn, Captain Henry Fitzallan, or Calverley, if it pleases him better, will be a dishonoured and penniless pauper. That’s what I’ll do!”</p>
<p>Fitzallan had meanwhile rung the bell, and presently the faithful Pinner appeared at the door. His master spoke to him with the utmost <i>sang-froid</i>.</p>
<p>“Pinner, just step over to the guard-room, and tell the sergeant to send a corporal and a file of men to turn this fellow out of barracks.”</p>
<p>“Yessir,” and Pinner disappeared with alacrity.</p>
<p>“You may spare yourself the trouble, sir,” said Creasey, foaming over with rage; “I’ve beaten you once, and I’ll beat you again. Good bye, Captain Fitzallan. Next time we meet perhaps you will be a little more humble.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps so,” said the other, dreamily; and before he had recovered from his vision, the doctor had taken his hat and was making his way downstairs with all speed. He jumped into his cab, and just managed to escape through the gates in time to be saved the degradation of being put out by the grinning soldiers forming the guard.</p>
<p>He drove straight to the nearest telegraph office, and despatched the following message to Padre Cupper: “He shows fight; very cocky, and won’t listen to reason; shall be back tomorrow in town, and will at once visit B —, and set the ball rolling. Get all your papers, &c., ready to meet me.”</p>
<p>“First-ration bugle gone, sir,” said the orderly sergeant, putting his head into Fitzallan’s room a few moments after the doctor’s departure.</p>
<p>“All right, sergeant — I’ll be with you in a moment.”</p>
<p>He rose, put on his sword and sash, and in a few minutes was inspecting the cutting up and distributing of great joints of beef and mutton for the next day’s use (it was Saturday), with as much calm and quiet as if the whole question of his parentage had not been newly raised, and in a more novel manner than any he had hitherto dreamed of. He really did not care, now, one jot whom they made him out to be; and the value of human affliction was beginning very plainly to be seen in his case, for it was evident that the question of self was rapidly turning into quite a secondary one, and that, while growing careless to his own interests, he was becoming careful for those of his neighbours.</p>
<p>For when he got back to his quarters, his duty being accomplished, he began to examine this re-awakened question of his birth, in so far only as it would affect others. He was so deadened by the terrible mental anguish, culminating in total prostration, which he had so recently gone through, that really and truly Creasey’s statement as to Colonel Calverley being his father, had astonished him in the least possible degree. He did not give himself the trouble — indeed, he had not the power — to think the circumstances fairly out, and he accepted the strange news almost at once without further thought. He believed this latest story, as he would have believed any that was suggested to him on the point, for the reason that his case was altogether so mysterious as to be at the present beyond his comprehension; and he was prepared to act upon it just as if the “over whelming proofs,” of which this Creasey talked so glibly, were already fully before his eyes. He did not care to dispute the statement for a moment as regarded himself, but he did set to work to attend to it with a view of protecting in the best manner possible the interests of others.</p>
<p>As he had told Mrs. Paulton, he had quite made up his mind to sell out and lose all, as soon as he had heard from Lady Clara Burton; and he meant what he had said at that time about waiting until he got that answer he was so feverishly expecting. But it never came, and as days lapsed into weeks, and weeks into months, the hope that was in him began to fade and to die away; then it passed into the yawning grave ever receiving the dead wishes, aspirations, and expectations of poor human nature: black despair settled down on him in a gloom he could not regard but as eternal: and he came to feel that he might as well go at once, and lapse into that profound obscurity which he had promised himself, as wait day by day sickening unto death under the blighting poison rising miasma-like from the corruption of buried hopes.</p>
<p>Thus self became as nothing to him, and if there was no great positive virtue in its super session under circumstances over which he had little or no control, there was the negative good that he accepted the inevitable with a willing mind, and found his only anxiety to be one for the good of persons who were almost strangers to him.</p>
<p>He knew that no one could blame him for holding the Fitzallan property by every means in his power, but at the same time he felt that it would be more just for him to give it up, now that he felt almost certain that he was <i>not</i> Henry Roberts, whoever else he might really be. It mattered not to him whether he was Smythe or Calverley, he would not dispute the case, which would doubtless be at once commenced against him; indeed he would give up the estates with out any proceedings at all, and thus strict legal justice would be accomplished, without trouble or worry to either side. But what was to be done about this Miss Esther Wyatt, who, for all he knew to the contrary, was quite dependent on the annuity she received from him — an annuity contingent on his being General Fitzallan’s inheritor? He could not, in justice, suddenly deprive her of her subsistence, and perhaps leave her to starve; and yet if he gave up the property, that was, in all probability, what would come to pass. He pondered over this view of the matter long — for weeks — and earnestly, and then he arrived at a resolution which promised to secure her against absolute total loss, and would at the same time satisfy his own conscience, so far as that could be done.</p>
<p>His idea, he felt, was Quixotic, or, rather, would be so regarded by the world; but not for that would he hesitate to put it in action. He would write to Mr. Martin to tell him at once the new phase into which his business had lapsed since the discovery made by Creasey, and he would direct the lawyer to take such immediate steps as would be necessary to place the next heir — he thought it was Mr. Belmore, though he was not quite clear on the point — in possession of the Fitzallan property, without more delay than the legal formalities would demand. But first of all he would take certain steps for the benefit of Esther Wyatt, though he did not intend to speak of them to Mr. Martin — at least at first — lest that gentleman might throw obstacles in the way, or at all events subject Fitzallan to entreaties and propositions which he could not entertain. His commission — though indeed he had never been quite clear as to which he held, that which he had gained on the field of battle, or the one procured for him by General Fitzallan — his commission was, at all events, his own; and that he determined to sell at once, get as much over-regulation (and he thought he should receive a handsome sum) as was possible, and then apply the whole of the proceeds to the purchase of an annuity for Esther Wyatt. Thus he would save the poor lady from absolute want, he would be giving up what he held wrongly in the eye of the law, if not of equity; and as for himself, and what would become of him — well, that was a matter, just now, of the most supreme indifference. The light of his life was quenched; what reason was there to care for what became of the lamp that had contained it?</p>
<p>When he had so made up his mind, he did not delay in putting his resolution into practice; but at the same time he went about the affair with a circumspection that few would have given him credit for. He called the seniors of the two commissioned grades below him to his quarters, and, without any eagerness, or excitement, or evidence that it was <i>necessary</i> for him to retire from the Service, he announced that he was thinking of doing so, and would send in his papers if sufficient inducements of a pecuniary nature were held out to him by thosa who would benefit by his withdrawal. The lieutenant and ensign concerned had long before expected that some such offer would be made to them, but it had been delayed so far beyond the time anticipated that they had again commenced to despair, and indeed had expressed their conviction that Fitz would not sell at all unless a good bit of money was got up to purchase him out. Accordingly, they had questioned their juniors of both ranks as to what sum could be made up, and when Fitzallan put his proposition, they were prepared with an answer that was tolerably accurate. They mentioned the over-regulation money that could be given; Fitzallan expressed himself satisfied with it, and the bargain, so far as it could be, was completed there and then.</p>
<p>Immediately Fitzallan sent in his application, “to be allowed to retire from the service by the sale of my commission;” and a sigh of relief went forth from almost the entire regiment when it became known that the only man who had ever raised a painful scandal in its ranks was about to leave it for good and all. The fact was telegraphed out to Colonel Calverley without an hour’s delay, and that noble warrior was laid by the heels with a fresh and most violent attack of gout, as a consequence of the reception of the news. The telegram was never shown to Lady Clara, nor what it contained even hinted at, and indeed her ladyship had no idea whatever, having been out when the message arrived, that there was any connection between her uncle’s fresh attack and the receipt of a missive from England.</p>
<p>But she knew that her uncle was terribly agitated and upset — that some interior struggle of unexampled fierceness (for him) was going on in his mind, and that, unless he speedily regained his ordinary quiet and calm, he must succumb to the disease from which he suffered such incessant pain. He had told her that that incessant agitation was the result of the law business connected with his little property — it was a mere trifle for a man in his position — business in which she sometimes helped, so far as copying letters, &c., went; and in her own innocent truthfulness she was quite content with the explanation, and prayed fervently that all the worry of it might immediately pass away, and leave her dear uncle once more at rest.</p>
<p>And the old man kept his couch in agony of mind as of body; and he cursed and blasphemed, in his rage against himself and against all the world, whenever that sweet girl was absent or out of ear-shot. And he lied to himself and to his God, for he said, “These things have come on me as a hideous mischance of fortune!” while he well knew that they fell upon him as judgments that could no longer be held back — that the sins of his youth were punishing him in the unrepentant days of his age. But he defied fortune as he defied God; and, indeed, to him, miserable worldling of worldlings, the two terms were little short of convertible.</p>
<!--There is a break between these paragraphs-->
<p>Mr. Martin received Captain Fitzallan’s communication without very much astonishment. He had become aware that his client’s mind had received a shock from what had occurred in connection with Lady Clara Burton, that had, in a measure, paralysed it; and he had nearly come to the conclusion, before the receipt of the final letter, that Fitzallan’s abandonment of the service, and of the property, was a mere question of time. Mr. Martin had, like all of his profession, seen an immense amount of suffering in the course of his life, but he had never before known a man so completely altered by mental trouble as was his client. Of course, and because of his professional instincts and training, he resisted with might and main the efforts of Captain Fitzallan to his own ruin, but Mr. Martin soon came to perceive that such resistance was perfectly futile; and though he strenuously continued it, he felt convinced that it was perfectly vain.</p>
<p>Nor was he much surprised at this new ground the scoundrel Creasey had broken. Mr. Martin had never taken very kindly to the Smythe version of the origin of Fitzallan; and from the investigations into the matter which he had made on his account, and, unknown — at least, to the extent to which they really went — to his client, he had become satisfied that Creasey’s story was <i>not</i> correct in all particulars, though he, Mr. Martin, had been unable as yet to get at what he considered a satisfactory solution of the strange circumstances. It was quite possible that Colonel Calverley really was the father of the unfortunate young man, who seemed to be a mere football for the kicks of Dame Chance; and if he was, and if he knew it (argued Mr. Martin), then there could hardly be on the face of the earth a more pestilent scoundrel — far superior in sustained villainy to even Creasey himself — than this same Colonel de Courcey Calverley, commanding Her Majesty’s “Eagles.” On one point Mr. Martin was quite resolved — that he would <i>not</i>, under present circumstances, accept his client’s directions as to making over the property, until the fullest and most satisfactory investigation had been made into all the particulars of this most singular case; and he proceeded at once to put his resolution into trim for being acted upon.</p>
<p>The great and immediate point, however, was to get his client to remain at rest until there were real grounds for taking decisive action, and to attain that end he wrote him a long letter — not indeed full of sound and fury, but most certainly signifying nothing. He told the Captain — it was the literal truth, even if nothing more — that he was taking prompt steps to set the case properly in motion; he hinted his opinion that there might be still further revelations, which would possibly give the business an entirely new colour; and he counselled three things — absolute confidence and reliance in himself (Mr. Martin), just as absolute calm and self-restraint; and if at all possible the obtaining of “urgent” leave to come over to London, and be on the spot for proper consultations with his legal adviser.</p>
<p>To that letter Captain Fitzallan briefly replied, expressing his satisfaction that Mr. Martin had set the matter of his former communication in motion; stating that he was quite prepared for any revelations, no matter of what nature; that he was perfectly calm and self-restrained, and that it was out of the question, besides being otherwise undesirable, his seeking to obtain leave just now. He added that he had every reliance in Mr. Martin’s abilities and judgment, but he omitted all mention of “confidence,” for the reason that he had, as yet, kept concealed from the solicitor the fact of his having sent in his papers of retirement. He justified to himself that want of complete confidence on the ground that what he was doing was for the best for Esther Wyatt; though of course it could not be otherwise regarded by any man of business like Mr. Martin than aa folly, pure and unadulterated. In his present mental state he had no desire for further conflict or further discussion with his solicitor on any disputed point; he wanted to do mere justice, and then to sink for ever into a profound obscurity, to be ended only with the moment of death. He had abandoned all hope in this world, and he did not care to have his motives, any more than his future actions, canvassed and dragged into light by any man, even though that man was his own solicitor, acting for the best according to his lights.</p>

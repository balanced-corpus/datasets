<!--chapter title: FROM THE GRIP OF THE LAW-->

<div><p>The Dream came to me as I lay<br>
Beneath the waving palm,<br>
It led me forth upon my way,<br>
It broke upon my calm,<br>
It whispered to me as I went<br>
Beneath the forest green,<br>
The Message that my God had sent<br>
To break my sleep serene.</p>

<p>Ah me! I travailed brave and strong,<br>
To set the wry World right,<br>
To succour those who suffered wrong,<br>
To fight the Holy Fight;<br>
And if the Wicked win the day<br>
‘Tis Allah’s will, I wean,<br>
Glad to His peace I’ll pass away,<br>
Who have His Vision seen!<br>
<i>The Song of the Dreamer of Dreams.</i></p>

<p>In the East men not infrequently suffer sadly because
they are so unfortunate as to possess ideas. In the
West, on the other hand, a man may hold all manner of
extravagant theories without necessarily being brought
by them to an evil end. The reason of this is very
plain. The less excitable European does not always
think it incumbent upon him to put all his theories
into practice, whereas the ideas which come to an
Oriental have a habit of running away with their
owner, leaving him no peace, until they have succeeded
in landing him in some very unsavoury place, such as
the Andaman Islands, or the Central Gaol.</p>

<p>The White Man, looking calmly at the age into
which he has been born, and at all the circumstances
of his surroundings, may tell himself that the times are
not yet ripe for the adoption of his more advanced
theories. This is a comforting view to take, for the
man who looks upon life and its difficulties in this
common-sense light runs no risks, while he has further
the consolation of thinking that he is blessed with an
intellect more far-seeing than those of his fellows. If
he has ideas very badly indeed, he may sit down and
write about them; and we all know that the profuse
ink-flux is an exceedingly efficient safety-valve. By
its means large quantities of bile and other disagreeable
fluids may be carried off, which, without some
such relief, might conceivably hurry their victim into
impossible action, dangerous to society, and still more
hazardous to himself. The inability of the Celt to
appreciate the fact that half a hundred excellent reasons
may exist for not putting a beautiful theory into
practice without more ado, is one of the qualities
that make the most Westerly people of Europe so
incongruously like the nations of the East. The
Russians, being to all intents and purposes an Oriental
race, share this inability with other Asiatic peoples.</p>

<p>But the majority of Brown Men go further than
this, for they can see no steps between the inception
of an idea and its realisation. Their natures are so
constructed that they cannot easily be made to understand
that all really sound theories are sure to be tried
upon their merits, if you only wait long enough, but
that for this to happen, the theory itself must have
some intrinsic value of its own. Even could they
appreciate this feet, it would not help them, for they
are impatient of delay. They want to see their
theories put into practice now, at once, during their
own lifetime. They are unable to look forward calmly
to the days when their children’s grandchildren will
enjoy many good things to which they must ever
remain strangers. ‘Why should we do so much for
Posterity? What has Posterity done for us?’ was
the impassioned exclamation of the excellent Sir Boyle
Roach, and the feeling expressed in this remarkable
phrase finds an echo in many an Oriental heart.</p>

<p>Moreover the Man with an Idea, if he belong to an
Asiatic race, never stays to ask himself whether his
theory is really for the good of the greatest number.
An intense belief in its merits comes to him with the
idea itself, and his utter faith in it is thus, from the
very first, both firm and unquestioning.</p>

<p>Now in Europe and Asia alike, the first object or
the political theorist is to break down the Present; but
while the White Man peers eagerly into the Future,
and his hands itch to fashion it according to his heart’s
desire, the Brown Man’s eyes are fixed dreamily upon
the Past. The White Man seeks to build up What
Ought To Be; the Brown Man longs to reconstruct
What Has Been; and since the unlettered Oriental
has none of the safety-valves which may bring relief
to the European, the Idea is wont to hurry him into
ill-considered and ill-advised action. Then, if the
Present chances to be presided over by the British
Government, that unwieldy monster lifts up its foot,
and stamps upon the Man with an Idea; and he and
those who have followed him thereafter suffer many
and heavy things because of the faith that is in them.</p>

<p>In the Malay State of Pahang there was once a
Man with an Idea. He had begun life as dog-boy to
a Prince; and the latter, after many wars, wrested the
throne from its rightful owners, and became a King.
As the new Monarch was a keen sportsman, and
appreciated the skill of the dog-boy, it followed that
the latter presently found himself the possessor of a
high-sounding title, a long and straggling river, and a
steady income, derived from ‘squeezing’ the couple
of thousand peasants who had their homes in the
valley through which this river ran. In an independent
Malay State, jobs on this magnificent scale
excite no adverse comment; and the simple villagers
bowed down before the ex-dog-boy, and feared him
exceedingly, as one who held unlimited power in his
hands.</p>

<p>I knew him well in those days, and he certainly
was a remarkable man. His knowledge of wood-craft
was unsurpassed, even among the aboriginal tribes of
jungle-dwellers, with whom, at certain seasons, he was
wont to herd, garbed, like them, in a scanty loincloth,
fashioned from the bark of the <i>trap</i> tree. He
was gifted with great physical strength, invincible
courage, much cunning, and a really marvellous
imagination. This latter possession is of no small
value to a Malay of the Peninsula, for in no land, and
among no other people, may a man more easily induce
others to take him at his own valuation. A huge
granite boulder, weighing some five tons, is still
pointed out, lying high up on the bank of the river,
over which the ex-dog-boy ruled, and the traveller,
who passes it, is told how the Chief plucked it with
one hand from the river bed, and cast it aside where it
now lies, because it chanced to obstruct the passage of
his dug-out. The Chief himself was responsible for
this remarkable statement, and no man dreamed of
doubting his word. Like the man who was the
bravest Knight in France, ‘he said so, and <i>he</i> ought
to know.’</p>

<p>Thus the ex-dog-boy’s reputation waxed very great
in the land, and he flourished exceedingly; and the
good old times ran gaily through the hour-glass in the
bad old way, until Pahang became a Protected State,
and the servants of the British Government began the
ungrateful and laborious task of teaching an unregenerate
people the elementary differences between
right and wrong, and between <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>.</p>

<p>The bulk of the people were well pleased, for peace
and plenty—strangers in their villages—began to draw
near, and to smile upon them. But the Chiefs could
not, of course, regard matters in quite the same light.
When a large district lies before him, from which he
may pick and choose all that his heart may desire,
without asking absurd questions as to ownership;
when his income is what he may elect to exact in fine
and cess from the cowed villagers, who dare not resist
him; when he is not cursed with a conscience; and
when he has no bowels of compassion in his anatomy,—
even though he be married half a dozen deep, a man
may succeed in living very much at his ease. But
when all these things, upon which he has learned to
rely, sink away suddenly from under him, as the Earth
drops downwards as you gaze at it from the car of a
rising balloon; when power, and wealth, and cherished
manorial rights,—such as were wont to make life so
sweet to him, so exceeding bitter to his neighbours,
—are all reft from him in a moment; when he is
called upon to live up to a standard of morality with
which he has no sympathy; and when his only compensation
is a monthly stipend,—the very regularity of
which robs life of half its excitement,—a man is apt to
become morose and taciturn, and to spend much time
in dreaming of the good old days.</p>

<p>Such was the experience of the ex-dog-boy; and
upon a certain day, as he lay tossing upon his mat,
and pondering moodily upon the Past, the Idea came
to him. Then, in that hour, several hundreds of souls
—men, and tender women, children at their mothers’
skirts, and little babies at the breast—were doomed to
terrible suffering, and, in too many instances, to a
lingering and untimely death.</p>

<p>The Idea was, of course, that the ex-dog-boy and
his people should rise up against the representatives
of the British Government, and should drive them
screaming from the land. The ex-dog-boy had nothing
to scale things by, and he knew that the White Men
and their followers were few. The matter seemed
easy, and he counted on the other Chiefs, who shared
his grievances, and his love of the good old times, to
join him, and share also in his risks. The peasants,
he knew, would follow the Chiefs in a war directed
against their best interests, from sheer force of habit,
and because the feudal feeling was still strong within
them; and in so judging the event proved him to be
right. But the other Chiefs lacked his courage, so
the rising never became general, though aid was lent
to the ex-dog-boy by every secret means that could
suggest themselves to his numerous well-born sympathisers.</p>

<p>And here it is that the Muhammadan has the
advantage of the Christian. If the latter wars with
the Powers that Be, he may be an Anarchist, or a
Socialist, or a Nihilist, but he is by no means necessarily
regarded as a Christian Hero. Some Christians
may be found to sympathise with him, but their
sympathy is in no sense connected with their religious
beliefs. But with the Muhammadan it is different.
If those against whom he rebels chance to belong
to any other Faith, no matter what the cause
of quarrel, no matter how lax the rebel’s own
practice may be, his revolt against authority is at once
raised to the dignity of a <i>Sabil Allah</i>, or Holy War
against the Infidel. It becomes a reproach to any
Muhammadan to side against him; all who aid him
thereby serve God and His Prophet; and in this lies
the real strength of a Muhammadan population. </p>

<p>Wonderful it is how powerful are those words ‘<i>Sabil
Allah</i>‘ among even the least fanatical of Muhammadans.
Men who never pray, not even on Friday; men who
break the Fast of Ramathân for thirty days each year;
men to whom the Faith is nothing but a name, and
whose knowledge of its tenets would disgrace an
ignorant European, can still be fired to enthusiasm,
when the sorriest and most selfish rebel among them
dignifies his storm in a tea-cup by calling it a Holy
War.</p>

<p>This merely affords one more instance of the
marvellous cohesion of the Muhammadans. Their
Faith, which is hedged about by pride and hate,
causes them to regard the professors of all other
religions with a passion of disdain, such as no modern
Christian can easily realise; and it has, withal, the
power to bind men one to another, as nothing else
can do. The old, simple, unquestioning Faith of the
Middle Ages, when the two thousand odd Christian
Sects were as yet uninvented, and when, speaking
broadly, all men held the same teaching upon all
points of theology, may have had some very similar
effect upon its professors; but the warlike Creed of
Muhammad has for its very marrow a desire to exterminate
all other Faiths—putting infidel men to the
sword, and leading their women-folk captive,—a spirit
which is certainly not to be found in the Gospels of
Christ.</p>

<p>This is the rough outer edge which Muhammadanism
presents to those who are not of the Faith;
but among themselves, those who believe in Allah and
the Prophet, exercise to one another a large and
generous charity, that may well put to shame the
Christians, to whom that virtue, in its highest practice,
should surely belong.</p>

<p>The ex-dog-boy opened the game by firing upon
a party of Europeans from the heavy jungles which
fringed the banks of the narrow river over which he
had once ruled supreme. He killed a few people, and
wounded some others. Then he chanced to catch
Sikh, who had lost his way in the jungle, and him he
strangled with a rattan, after making him, while still
living, the victim of nameless mutilations. Thus the
first blood was to him; and his people followed him
like sheep, with their old fear of him, and their belief
in his prowess waxing strong within them.</p>

<p>But his next move in the game was a mistake.
Malays chiefly conduct their warfare from behind
stockades, the attacking party constructing their rude
works at a safe and convenient distance from those of
the enemy. Much breath is expended in shouts and
vaunting challenges, and large quantities of gunpowder
are burned, but after war has raged for many
months a mere handful of casualties have to be counted,
for no attempt is made to rush a stockade so long as
any watch is kept within it. The ex-dog-boy believed
that White Men fought upon a like principle; so when
he took the field, he built numerous forts, all of which
were promptly destroyed.</p>

<p>I shall not follow him through the various stages
of the campaign which ensued, but eventually he
became convinced that he and his people must make
their way out of Pahang if they would win to safety.
He dared not travel by any known route, but his
skill in wood-craft has been spoken of. He took to
the jungle, with some six hundred men, women, and
children, and during the space of five months he
wormed his way through untraversed forests, guiding
himself wholly by the knowledge which he possessed
of the river-systems of the country, until after many
adventures, and almost unparalleled hardships, the
strange journey was accomplished, and the miserable
remnant, that had survived the march, won clear of
the country.</p>

<p>If you know the East Coast of the Malay Peninsula
well, you can make your way up and down it, and
across and across, and through and through, by following
the net-work of narrow footpaths which thread
the jungles here, there, and everywhere. Travelling
in this fashion is not easy, for the trails are almost
blind in places, and every now and then a wood-knife
must make a way through the forest before a man
may pass. But the fugitives dared not follow well-known
paths, or any paths at all, save in the wildest
and least frequented parts of the forest, and even then
they were constantly harassed by their enemies. For
the rest, they cleared their own way through the
depths of a Malayan jungle, which is more like one
enormous thick-set hedge, bound fast by ropes innumerable,
stayed at every point by giant trees, than
anything else which the untravelled Englishman can
easily imagine. Half a mile a day was a good journey
in such country; and when the food failed, a few
yards was almost more than the stricken wretches could
accomplish. Their line of march was marked by
<i>bâiyas</i> and <i>îbul</i>, and other wild palms, which had been
felled, that men might fill their empty stomachs with
the edible shoots. At every point the earth had been
grubbed up, as by a thousand moles. This marked
the places where jungle roots and yams had been dug
for. At spots where the <i>kĕpâyang</i> fruit grew plentifully
the refugees had camped for over a week, and
many new graves marked their resting-place, for the
<i>kĕpâyang</i> bears an ill name.</p>

<div><p>Kĕpâyang fruits so green and fair,<br>
How like my Love are they!<br>
To eat thereof I do not dare,<br>
Yet cannot throw away!</p></div>

<p>says the Malay rhyme; but those who run from the
grip of the Law are foredoomed to the suffering of
many things, and by a starving stomach no food, no
matter how unhealthy, may be lightly rejected.</p>

<p>For the first three months or so the rebels kept more
or less together, for deserters were dealt with severely
by the Chief, and at night-time, round the fires of the
camp, he told blood-curdling tales of the vengeance of
the White Men, filling his simple followers with a
fear that made them prefer a lingering death in the
forests to even a chance of capture. But when the
cruel grip of hunger began to wring their empty
stomachs, those among the rebels who still had the
strength to do so, pushed on, devouring the jungle
foods as they went, while the weak and feeble lagged
hopelessly behind in a land where there was no
gleaning. </p>

<p>The forests were dotted with little knots of stragglers,
and we gathered them in, filled them with
good food, and sent them home to their villages, with
peace upon their faces, and in their eyes glad wonder
at the treatment meted out to them. We followed up
the main body of the rebels, and fought them again and
again in the blind jungles, where nought could be
seen save trees and dripping greenery, with the thick,
white smoke-clouds bellying through between trunks
and leaves, or hanging low in the still air. Here men
were struck dead not seeing the hand that smote them,
while the rifles sang out sharply, and clearly, and
fiercely, breaking through the forest in a thousand
echoes, amid the discordant war-yells of the enemy,
and the answering roar of our own people.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the fifth month the chase grew
hotter, and the little bands of survivors dwindled daily
in number. We followed them up relentlessly, for
Pahang stood at gaze, irresolute concerning the action
which it would be wise for it to take while the success
or failure of the Government hung uncertainly in the
balance. Sometimes we lost all trace of the fugitives
for weeks together ; sometimes, for a day or two, we
were hot upon their trail, and we had a stirring little
brush with them in those dreary forests every other
hour. The stragglers became more and more numerous,
while the Chief and his fighting-men pressed
forward with increased eagerness as they neared the
Kĕlantan boundary. The distress of the fugitives became
daily more acute, and never shall I forget the
horror of those days, and the heartrending scenes of
which I was a witness.</p>

<p>Sometimes it would be a small knot of stragglers,
mostly women and ghastly little children—children
whose care-worn faces seemed to bear the weight of a
hundred years of pain and sorrow. We would find
them sitting huddled together, in utter, dull despair,
looking at us almost calmly from out the awful hollows
of their deep-set eyes. How well I know that miserable,
squalid group, and the sick passion of pity which
the sight of it awakens! They never doubt but that
death awaits them, but even that seems to them to be
preferable to any prolongation of the keen yet lingering
agony from which they are suffering. They are in
the last stages of famine. Their skulls show sharp and
angular, with knobs of protruding temple, and prominent
cheek-bones visible beneath the taut, dry skin.
Their knees, their elbows, every joint in their shrunken
bodies, are bosses of bone, huge, and round, and ugly,
from which depend brittle, stick-like limbs, hanging
feeble and inert. Their feet and hands resemble the
talons of some unclean night-fowl, and their ribs rise
clear, each one of them as separate and as distinctly
marked as the bold, black stripes upon a tiger’s hide.
Their stomachs alone are swollen and inflated, dreadfully
out of all proportion to their wasted frames, but
the roundness is that of disease, not the curves of health.
Their eyes are the eyes of wild beasts when food is set
before them, and like animals they throw themselves
upon it, seizing and tearing it in the fury of their
hunger. But when the first few mouthfuls have been
devoured, their strange, feeble listlessness returns, and
the slow, painful languor of their movements makes
them resemble more and more closely a weird band of
spectres in some ugly Dance of Death </p>

<p>Sometimes we would find a man, sitting with his
head fallen forward between his knees, with his back
against a tree, with his arms pendent and nerveless,
and his legs drawn convulsively up against his empty
stomach. His body would be a mere bag of bones,—
slender, frail bones, in a wofully tight casing of yellow,
fever-parched skin. Such an one would too often be
beyond all human aid, his shrunken gullet refusing to
swallow the brandy which we forced through his set
teeth. His mouth would be half full of some horrible
trash, with which he had tried to stay the pangs of his
hunger, stuff which he had lacked the power even to
eject. His glassy eyes would stare horribly into our
pitying faces, and without a word he would pass away
while we stood around him.</p>

<p>Wonderful devotion was shown to one another by
some of these poor folk in their common necessity.
Once we found a man sitting gaunt and grim, by the
side of one whom he had loved. He was too weak to
be able to bury his dead, but he would not leave the
useless skin and bone, which hunger had transformed
into a mummy, for the beasts of the forest to devour.
He would neither eat nor move until the body had
been washed and buried, according to the rites of the
Muhammadans; and those who did these last offices
told me that the dead man’s mouth was full of rice
which he had been unable to swallow,—the last hoarded
handful that the starving father had forced upon his
dying son!</p>

<p>On another occasion we found a little party of
three, a man and his wife, with their baby at her breast.
All were in sore straits for lack of food, and the woman
had quite lost the use of her legs. The man carried
her upon his bowed back, bound to him by an old
<i>sârong</i> or native waist-cloth. In his hands were two
bundles, containing all that remained to them of the
wreck of their household goods. The woman nursed
the fretful baby in the hollow of her left arm, and with
her disengaged hand she sought to clear the way for
her man, hacking feebly at the lower branches of the
trees, and at the thick underwood with a clumsy wood-knife.
She was quite a young girl, while the man was
middle-aged, and neither of them were at all good to
look upon, but when they gazed at one another I saw
the love-light well up in their eyes. Just before we
chanced upon them this poor family had struggled, in
the manner which I have described, over the summit
of a hill nearly a thousand feet in height, whence they
had again descended into the plain. I know not
how long this part of their journey had taken them,
nor what measure of toil, and pain, and heart-breaking
effort had been the man’s ere half his self-imposed task
had been accomplished; but whatever he may have
suffered, and however great the strain that he had put
upon his endurance, I know that his first care was for
the woman, when we set food before them. I remember,
too, that he insisted upon helping to carry the
litter upon which we laid her, though he could hardly
stagger along unaided when the strain to which he had
nerved himself had been removed. When we got the
girl to one of the field hospitals he watched beside her,
tending her with a constant care and gentleness very
pitiful to sec; and even in her last agony her eyes
followed him lovingly. But though he failed to stay
the life that ebbed so fast away from her, I cannot
think that his love, and his labour, and his suffering,
and his pain, were utterly wasted.</p>

<p>But, perhaps, the saddest incident of all was that
which befell at the very end of the Disturbances, when
we were hunting the vanguard of the rebels through
the forests that cluster around the borders of Kĕlantan.
They had still a few of their women and children
with them, but the men were nearing safety and
plenty, so those who sank by the way, too utterly worn
out to make a further effort, were now often deserted
even by their own kinsfolk.</p>

<p>We were close upon the track of the rebels, whose
footsteps we had been following all day, and we were
expecting every moment to come up with them. The
afternoon was far advanced, and we hoped to find
them in camp. Some of the tracks were so fresh that
water was still oozing into the depressed toe-prints,
and the Dyak trackers in front were beginning to
bristle with excitement, like hounds on a hot scent.
The evening hymn, which all the jungle creatures
join in singing as the sun sinks, was ringing through
the forest, the parrots calling shrilly one to another as
they swooped upon the clouds of flying insects, the
birds thrilling and quavering upon almost every tree,
while the <i>cicada</i> raised their strident tocsin to tell that
the day was dead.</p>

<p>Suddenly, through all the tumult of the animal and
insect world, there broke upon our ears a cry that
made our heart-beats quicken. It was the whine of a
little child; but to us it meant that a camp which we
hoped held the advance party of the rebels—the men
whom we had so long pursued, yet had never once
taken unawares—was close at hand. We crept
forward as noiselessly as we were able, turning into
the bed of a stream and wading down the shallows.
Presently the Dyak trackers, who were leading,
stiffened like pointers, and the next moment four of
them fired a volley. Their orders had been to hold
their fire until they received the word, but Dyalcs are
ill to hold when the chance of killing presents itself.
I rushed forward, and came up with the Dyaks in time
to see that they had fired into a small camp on the
river bank, and pushing past them I ran into the little
cluster of temporary sheds. One man lay dead with a
bullet through his stomach; another, huddled up
under a torn and shabby velvet coverlet, was squirming
with fear, and crying to us to slay him speedily, if
indeed we desired to take his life.</p>

<p>In the centre of the camp sat a woman with a little
child, a girl of perhaps five years of age, clinging convulsively
to her. Both mother and child were screaming
in a manner most pitiful to hear. I turned the
man with the coverlet over with my foot, and bade
him hold his peace, as no man had any intention of
harming him. He was in the last stages of dropsy,
brought on by the hardships which he had endured in
the damp, comfortless jungles, and he sat there, a
horrible sight, calling upon his bloated carcase to burst
if he were in thought or deed inimical to the British
Government.</p>

<p>Disregarding him, I pushed on to where the
woman sat, and strove to reassure her.</p>

<p>‘Peace, Sister!’ I said. l There is no one here who
desireth to hurt thee.’</p>

<p>‘Not hurt me?’ she cried, with a fresh outburst of
screams. ‘Not hurt me? Behold!’</p>

<p>She had been sitting cross-legged on the ground,
but as she spoke, she kicked her left leg forward, and
it opened in the middle of her shin, until the heel
snapped limply against the inside of her knee. A red
chasm opened like the mouth of a shark, wide, and
gaping, and horrible to see, and a spurt of warm blood
spattered me from head to foot. She rolled over on
her back in a dead faint. The bones of her leg were
both sundered by the cruel Snider bullet, which to all
intents and purposes is an expanding missile, and the
severed arteries pumped the blood out in little eddying
jets. The ground on which she lay speedily became
covered with a broad patch of scarlet, clotting in
cracking blebs and blisters, upon which a thousand
flies settled and feasted horribly, and while we strove
vainly to staunch the flow of blood, the little girl sat
placidly at her mother’s side, munching a captain’s
biscuit, which we had given to her, clasping it greedily
between her tiny hands. The utter insensibility of
the child to her mother’s sufferings, and the ease with
which - food distracted her attention from all other
things, was not the least ghastly feature of that painful
scene.</p>

<p>Presently the wounded woman began slowly to
recover consciousness. Her head rolled restlessly from
side to side, a low groan escaped her, and her eyes
opened and fixed themselves upon me as I knelt by her
side leaning over her. The look they wore—the look
of some tender, hunted animal gazing despairingly at
her captor—made the lump rise queerly in my throat.
Her lips were painfully forming words, and I bent low
to catch them. They came faint, and halting, and
broken with suffering, but even in that moment of
agony the mother’s heart was with her child.</p>

<p>‘Wilt...thou...slay...my...child...in
like manner ? ‘</p>

<p>‘O Sister!’ I cried, in the familiar vernacular
phrase which makes all folks akin. ‘O Sister, thou
knowest that we had no desire to harm thee. It was
a bullet that had gone astraying, a bullet that had lost
its way which did thee this hurt. Have no fear for
thy child.’</p>

<p>‘If thou slayest her not,’ came the painful whisper,
‘she is still as one already dead, living as she will do,
having neither father nor mother, nor any relative to
tend or love her.’</p>

<p>‘Peace, Sister!’ I said. ‘I myself will tend and
love her. Have no fear for her.’</p>

<p>The woman looked up at me wonderingly, stupidly,
until the meaning of my words at last forced itself
upon her tortured brain. Then, with a supreme
effort, she raised herself into a half-sitting posture.</p>

<p>‘Say that again!’ she screamed, and I repeated the
words of my promise.</p>

<p>‘Swear that thou wilt tend her!’ she cried next,
and I swore solemnly in the name of God. Then
she sank back exhausted, but with peace upon her
face.</p>

<p>‘It is well,’ she murmured, ‘and now leave me
with my child for a little space before I die.’ </p>

<p>I left her, and as I turned away I saw her draw the
emaciated little creature to her heart, while her face
spoke of love unfathomable, and her lips moved pain-
fully, as they formed the words of the baby language
—that tenderest of all tongues—which only mothers
and little children, the purest of our kind, know and
understand.</p>

<p>We camped on the opposite side of the stream, and
the night fell dark and impenetrable. At about eight
o’clock a pure baby’s voice broke the stillness. </p>

<p>‘Come and fetch me,’ it cried. ‘Come and fetch
me, for my mother is dead!’</p>

<p>And presently the poor little starving girl, whose sad
experience had taught her so early to recognise death,
was carried across the stream in the arms of one of my
Malays, and was laid to sleep beside me upon my mat.
Next day she was put into a knapsack, fashioned of
rattan, and sent to the rear; and, as I write these lines
five years later, the sound of a merry laugh is borne in
to me from the place where the children of my native
followers are playing together in my compound.
The laugh rings out in the shrill pure treble of happy
childhood, and when I hear it I pause in my work, and
wonder whether the child’s mother looks down upon
her little one, and is satisfied that after all her life has
not been quite a loveless one.</p>

Stephen Marsh, member of the College of Surgeons, supplied a noteworthy illustration of the incompleteness 
of human—and indeed animal—cunning. The stoat that fastens on the hare’s throat has no eyes or ears for 
the keeper swinging his ash-stick over the head of the exultant little bloodsucker. The black cormorant, 
perched upon the slippery ridge of weed-fringed rock, and poising itself with flap ping wings and eager neck 
outstretched for a plunge among the gleaming mackerel, quite forgets that on its crag above the osprey waits, 
with glittering eye and ruffled plumes, ready to swoop down almost to the sea itself, and rob the robber. Politicians 
are often as shortsighted in their simple greed as stoats and cormorants can be; and other men of professed 
astuteness, from the disreputable rigger of the thimbles to the respectable rigger of the money-market, are just 
as liable to blindness as are politicians. 
</p>
<p>
Lord Ulswater’s rebellious instrument was a keen edge-tool, dangerous to handle. Mr. Marsh may perhaps have 
had no special aptitude for the art of healing, but he was able, and, in his way, adroit. For the clumsy 
coarseness with which he had conducted his attempted negotiation with William Morgan, he was not, after all, 
so very much to blame: he could not fairly be expected to anticipate the honourable instinct that debarred 
the discarded suitor from taking a share in the plot to ruin, by legal means, the man who had stolen from him 
the dearest prize that life held; and the ex-Bursch of a secondrate German university, who had learned to view 
the world through a hazy atmosphere of bad tobacco-smoke, bad beer, bad poetry and metaphysics, and whose 
after-experiences had tended to sour and degrade him, might be pardoned for believing the worst of those with 
whom he came in accidental contact.
</p>
<p>
While, however, Mr. Marsh was keeping heedful watch on the new M.P. for Oakshire, by whose help he trusted to 
secure a fulcrum for the lever that should topple down John, Lord Ulswater, from his pride of place, he 
absolutely neglected to secure himself from being the object of any similar scouting operations ; and yet, all 
that morning, from the hour when he first threw open his window to admit the welcome summer wind into the den 
of a dressing-room in which he stood, forcing his hand to be steady as he reaped his steel-hard beard with the 
sharp razor, an eye had been upon him, and his outgoings had been observed with a care that would have startled 
him not a little.
</p>
<p>
When the town omnibus, garish in its summer coat of red and green, like a Brazil parrot, came tinkling and 
clanging on its rattling wheels and complaining springs, to the surgeon’s huge stucco-fronted house, its 
arrival was not unnoticed. Mr. Marsh’s presence of mind, as displayed in that little matter of the pistol, 
was remarked also by the same eye-witness who saw the omnibus drive round to take the doctor up, and who had 
known the doctor’s intentions as to his trip to the metropolis, almost as early as the doctor himself.
</p>
<p>
It has been mentioned that a cattle-fair had lately been held at an inland town within easy reach of Shellton, 
and that certain cattle-vans, destined to convey beef to the all-devouring mouth of London, were attached to 
the train at that station. The beef aforesaid being still in the shape of live oxen, capable of suffering from 
thirst, and heat, and dust, and confinement, and, moreover, provided with a due complement of horns and hoofs, 
wherewith, at the last extremity of wretchedness, to avenge the wrongs of the bovine race upon its tyrants, 
sundry stout drovers, with iron-pointed ash-plants in their hands, and brass badges worn inside their greasy 
fustian coats, were in attendance on these four-footed travellers. One of these cow-compelling persons, a sturdy 
fellow, who wore a red cotton handkerchief tied so loosely round his brawny throat that the lower part of his 
face was almost wholly hidden by its broad folds, and whose mangy brown cap was slouched down to his very eyes, 
was obtrusively active in his vocation, dealing such thwacks with his tough stick that the flanks of his 
unoffending charges sounded again to the blows, and swearing with much vigour and relish, yet never losing a 
chance of following, with his roving, deep-set eyes, the proceedings of Mr. Marsh.
</p>
<p>
The hero of the red pocket-handkerchief was evidently an outsider. Hard as he struck among the bullocks, as, 
blundering, and bellowing forth their wonder and alarm, they were hustled into the vans, and packed head and 
tail, like sardines in a box, his manipulation of the stick was rather that of a brilliant amateur than of a 
trained professional. He did not know the tender spots, or ply the goad which he as well as the others carried, 
in defiance of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, in the same perfection as the rest. Also, 
whereas the other men chatted or swore at each other quite familiarly as Jack and Harry, no one addressed the 
broad-shouldered personage by name.
</p>
<p>
“Doing old Nat’s work, ain’t he?” one fellow gruffly asked of another, pointing over his shoulder at the knight 
of the red kerchief.
</p>
<p>
“Ay, ay,” was the answer. “Old Nat’s that drunk he won’t be fit to do anything these three days. The chap stood 
a goodish drop of beer over there at the <em>Three Fishers</em>. Old Nat gave his job, he did, but he wouldn’t 
be so jolly green as to lend him his badge and his licence. What the man wants to take cattle up to market for, 
I don’t know, unless he expects to crib a beast or two, but I’ll go bail I look too sharp to be gammoned by a 
Johnny Raw.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll bet a pint, and a pint at the back o’ that, you do, Mr. Tradgett,” said the admiring underling who was 
lieutenant to this Smithfield cattle-captain, and then added in a lower tone, that the freshman was a queer 
sort of strongish customer, and not one to quarrel with, if so be it could be helped; a remark which, confirmed 
as it was by the stout make and resolute aspect of the new recruit, carried conviction to the mind of the head 
drover.
</p>
<p>
In all professions there is a corporate feeling antagonistic to interlopers, and thus it proved in the present 
instance. These rugged bullock-drivers eyed their amateur comrade askance, and gave him the cold shoulder, very 
much as second-year Christ-church men, or second-enlistment soldiers, or regular members of a county-hunt, are 
apt to survey a novice suddenly thrust into their company. There was a freemasonry among them, and the lastcomer 
had not the pass-words of the order. But the man with the red handkerchief swathed about his thick neck seemed 
to care very little indeed for the lack of cordiality with which he was treated by his colleagues, but busied 
himself in his new duties, keeping all the while a wary watch upon the opposite platform.
</p>
<p>
“You’d better get in again, sharp, or you’ll be left behind, my buck,” an excitable railway policeman had shouted, 
at the very time when the scene between Fortunatus Morgan and Mr. Marsh, consequent upon the accidental dropping 
of the pistol, had come to a close, and the surgeon, jumping into a first-class carriage, was hastily handing to 
the guard the difference of price between his second-class ticket and the full fare. “Do you hear me, there, you 
in the red neckhandkercher?” screamed the policeman again, as the bell rang and the engine whistled responsive. 
It <em>was</em> very provoking. The train had been made up for some time, and with much toil; only one or two 
laggards among the second-class passengers were yet to be pushed or persuaded into their places; the luggage was 
being flung into the van as they pitch coke into a furnace; and there was one of those drover fellows, the noisy 
one with the red handkerchief and mangy cap, standing in the middle of the platform, gaping at young Squire Morgan 
and the surgeon, as if they had been playactors—so the policeman afterwards declared—performing for his especial 
amusement.
</p>
<p>
“You get in, will yer?” growled the head-drover, with a <em>sotto-voce</em> accompaniment of oaths, looking out 
from his perch near the cattle; and the stout man with the red kerchief slowly obeyed.
</p>
<p>
“What the (Pandemonium) did it signify to you, staring at those swells?” austerely demanded the chief herdsman. 
But he got no answer, and perhaps expected none, the new-comer merely hitching his shoulder round as he began 
to chew a lump of strong negrohead tobacco that he took from his waistcoat pocket, the rules of the railway 
company not permitting the solace of a pipe. When, however, the train had got a few miles on its upward journey, 
the volunteer drover proved himself to be possessed of more clubbable qualities than he had previously been 
credited with, since, from a red bundle that lay at his feet, and which had for envelope a cotton handkerchief 
similar to that which encircled its proprietor’s throat, he produced some cold meat and bread, a black bottle 
containing gin, and a pack of well-thumbed cards, and thus enabled his fellow-travellers to while away the time 
in a fashion much to their taste.
</p>
<p>
“How did you get all them blue patterns on your arms, mate?” asked Mr. Tradgett, the drover-in-chief, curiously 
eyeing the dark-blue tattooing that marked the sturdy wrists of the amateur in cattle-tending.
</p>
<p>
“Some was done with gunpowder, regular, and some with the infernal cuttle-fish dye the black fellows use.—That 
mermaid’s neat, and so’s the anchor <em>with</em> a true-lover’s knot!” said the person addressed, looking down 
with a pardonable pride, like that of the owner of some famous picture-gallery, on the designs stamped indelibly 
upon his skin.
</p>
<p>
“And the letters W.H.—that’ll stand for your name, I suppose?” inquired another of the group.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe they will, and maybe they won’t,” sulkily answered the tattooed gentleman, shaking the black bottle, in 
hopes that a little gin might still remain in it. But the gin was all drunk, and the card-playing had languished 
of late, seeing that the red-kerchiefed man had won as many shillings, sixpences, and copper coins as could well 
be extracted from the pockets of the company. Red Kerchief was none the more popular in consequence. The winner 
is generally viewed with anything but affection, and above all, when he adds the offence of mystery to that of 
gaining other people’s money. Who was this honorary member of the drovers’ club? the legitimate constituents of 
the society began to ask themselves. He had distributed his gin very freehandedly, no doubt, but then what 
business had he to hold such cards, and to back his luck by such skill? At Blind Hookey, at Van John, at Beggar 
my Neighbour, at whist, he had won, and won, and won till they would stake no more, and were half inclined to set 
upon him, pick a quarrel with him, and pommel him to a jelly. Who was he?
</p>
<p>
When the train reached London, Red Kerchief’s late comrades had still more reason to ask the question, since, 
without even affecting to “bear a hand” in getting the cattle out of their waggons, utterly regardless of the 
commands or curses of the foreman, off the travelled man of the tattooed wrists and brown cap went, with a quick 
step, following in the wake of Mr. Marsh, M.R.C.S.
</p>
<p>
The surgeon, unencumbered by any luggage more ponderous than his little black bag, was not long in springing into 
the first cab whose driver would consent to receive a solitary male passenger. But before he could find this 
compliant if repining Jehu, Mr. Marsh had had to hail the charioteers of some eight or nine hack vehicles, the 
Phaetons of every one of which, on the look-out for ladies, children, nursemaids, canvas-covered trunks, birdcages, 
lap-dogs, and rocking-horses, were deaf to his appeals; and this gave time for Red Kerchief to come stealthily 
up, and, ensconced behind a wooden pillar, to note Mr. Marsh’s proceedings. The nose-bag was jerked away from the 
head of the patient brute in the shafts, the hard reins were gathered up, and with a cut of the frayed whip, the 
horse was set in motion. The cab went off at a slow trot. Red Kerchief set off at a trot too, following the cab.
</p>
<p>
A good runner was this man, who had been tattooed in some out-of-the-way part of the world, and who had just taken 
French leave of his self-imposed duties as a drover. The day was hot, and the London atmosphere oppres sively 
sultry, the heavy air seeming to reek with vapours of every organic origin, and to be at the same time loaded 
with carbon, and gritty with the powdered granite of the roads. But the pursuer held his own well, keeping the 
cab constantly in sight, and shewing no symptoms of distress. A well-dressed man, running through London streets 
at such a pace, would have been set down as an escaping pickpocket or ring-snatcher, and even a boy would probably 
have provoked a cry of “Stop thief!” But such men as Red Kerchief, who have the look of porters, messengers, 
doers of jobs miscellaneous, henchmen of the London Demos, are privileged to run. The police never thought of 
inquiring of the swift-footed Ganymede, as he went by, wherefore he hurried thus.
</p>
<p>
At the corner of Arundel Street, Strand, Mr. Marsh paid off his cab. From habit, rather than from any apprehension, 
he cast one scrutinising glance around him. Leaning against a post, with his back turned, was a sturdy man in a 
red neck-handkerchief, dressed in fustian and a cap ; you may see a myriad such, any day, in the streets of London. 
Mr. Marsh went his way, not giving the fustian-clad form a second thought, and Bendigo Bill, looking over his 
shoulder, watched him as he went.

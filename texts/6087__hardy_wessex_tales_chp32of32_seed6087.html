<!--CHAPTER VII—THE WALK TO WARM’ELL CROSS AND AFTERWARDS-->
<p>As the goods had all to be carried to Budmouth that night, the excisemen’s
next object was to find horses and carts for the journey, and they went
about the village for that purpose. Latimer strode hither and
thither with a lump of chalk in his hand, marking broad-arrows so vigorously
on every vehicle and set of harness that he came across, that it seemed
as if he would chalk broad-arrows on the very hedges and roads.
The owner of every conveyance so marked was bound to give it up for
Government purposes. Stockdale, who had had enough of the scene,
turned indoors thoughtful and depressed. Lizzy was already there,
having come in at the back, though she had not yet taken off her bonnet.
She looked tired, and her mood was not much brighter than his own.
They had but little to say to each other; and the minister went away
and attempted to read; but at this he could not succeed, and he shook
the little bell for tea.</p>
<p>Lizzy herself brought in the tray, the girl having run off into the
village during the afternoon, too full of excitement at the proceedings
to remember her state of life. However, almost before the sad
lovers had said anything to each other, Martha came in in a steaming
state.</p>
<p>‘O, there’s such a stoor, Mrs. Newberry and Mr. Stockdale!
The king’s excisemen can’t get the carts ready nohow at
all! They pulled Thomas Ballam’s, and William Rogers’s,
and Stephen Sprake’s carts into the road, and off came the wheels,
and down fell the carts; and they found there was no linch-pins in the
arms; and then they tried Samuel Shane’s waggon, and found that
the screws were gone from he, and at last they looked at the dairyman’s
cart, and he’s got none neither! They have gone now to the
blacksmith’s to get some made, but he’s nowhere to be found!’</p>
<p>Stockdale looked at Lizzy, who blushed very slightly, and went out
of the room, followed by Martha Sarah. But before they had got
through the passage there was a rap at the front door, and Stockdale
recognized Latimer’s voice addressing Mrs. Newberry, who had turned
back.</p>
<p>‘For God’s sake, Mrs. Newberry, have you seen Hardman
the blacksmith up this way? If we could get hold of him, we’d
e’en a’most drag him by the hair of his head to his anvil,
where he ought to be.’</p>
<p>‘He’s an idle man, Mr. Latimer,’ said Lizzy archly.
‘What do you want him for?’</p>
<p>‘Why, there isn’t a horse in the place that has got more
than three shoes on, and some have only two. The waggon-wheels
be without strakes, and there’s no linch-pins to the carts.
What with that, and the bother about every set of harness being out
of order, we shan’t be off before nightfall—upon my soul
we shan’t. ‘Tis a rough lot, Mrs. Newberry, that you’ve
got about you here; but they’ll play at this game once too often,
mark my words they will! There’s not a man in the parish
that don’t deserve to be whipped.’</p>
<p>It happened that Hardman was at that moment a little further up the
lane, smoking his pipe behind a holly-bush. When Latimer had done
speaking he went on in this direction, and Hardman, hearing the exciseman’s
steps, found curiosity too strong for prudence. He peeped out
from the bush at the very moment that Latimer’s glance was on
it. There was nothing left for him to do but to come forward with
unconcern.</p>
<p>‘I’ve been looking for you for the last hour!’
said Latimer with a glare in his eye.</p>
<p>‘Sorry to hear that,’ said Hardman. ‘I’ve
been out for a stroll, to look for more hid tubs, to deliver ‘em
up to Gover’ment.’</p>
<p>‘O yes, Hardman, we know it,’ said Latimer, with withering
sarcasm. ‘We know that you’ll deliver ‘em up
to Gover’ment. We know that all the parish is helping us,
and have been all day! Now you please walk along with me down
to your shop, and kindly let me hire ye in the king’s name.’</p>
<p>They went down the lane together; and presently there resounded from
the smithy the ring of a hammer not very briskly swung. However,
the carts and horses were got into some sort of travelling condition,
but it was not until after the clock had struck six, when the muddy
roads were glistening under the horizontal light of the fading day.
The smuggled tubs were soon packed into the vehicles, and Latimer, with
three of his assistants, drove slowly out of the village in the direction
of the port of Budmouth, some considerable number of miles distant,
the other excisemen being left to watch for the remainder of the cargo,
which they knew to have been sunk somewhere between Ringsworth and Lulstead
Cove, and to unearth Owlett, the only person clearly implicated by the
discovery of the cave.</p>
<p>Women and children stood at the doors as the carts, each chalked
with the Government pitchfork, passed in the increasing twilight; and
as they stood they looked at the confiscated property with a melancholy
expression that told only too plainly the relation which they bore to
the trade.</p>
<p>‘Well, Lizzy,’ said Stockdale, when the crackle of the
wheels had nearly died away. ‘This is a fit finish to your
adventure. I am truly thankful that you have got off without suspicion,
and the loss only of the liquor. Will you sit down and let me
talk to you?’</p>
<p>‘By and by,’ she said. ‘But I must go out
now.’</p>
<p>‘Not to that horrid shore again?’ he said blankly.</p>
<p>‘No, not there. I am only going to see the end of this
day’s business.’</p>
<p>He did not answer to this, and she moved towards the door slowly,
as if waiting for him to say something more.</p>
<p>‘You don’t offer to come with me,’ she added at
last. ‘I suppose that’s because you hate me after
all this?’</p>
<p>‘Can you say it, Lizzy, when you know I only want to save you
from such practices? Come with you of course I will, if it is
only to take care of you. But why will you go out again?’</p>
<p>‘Because I cannot rest indoors. Something is happening,
and I must know what. Now, come!’ And they went into
the dusk together.</p>
<p>When they reached the turnpike-road she turned to the right, and
he soon perceived that they were following the direction of the excisemen
and their load. He had given her his arm, and every now and then
she suddenly pulled it back, to signify that he was to halt a moment
and listen. They had walked rather quickly along the first quarter
of a mile, and on the second or third time of standing still she said,
‘I hear them ahead—don’t you?’</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ he said; ‘I hear the wheels. But what
of that?’</p>
<p>‘I only want to know if they get clear away from the neighbourhood.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said he, a light breaking upon him. ‘Something
desperate is to be attempted!—and now I remember there was not
a man about the village when we left.’</p>
<p>‘Hark!’ she murmured. The noise of the cartwheels
had stopped, and given place to another sort of sound.</p>
<p>”Tis a scuffle!’ said Stockdale. ‘There’ll
be murder! Lizzy, let go my arm; I am going on. On my conscience,
I must not stay here and do nothing!’</p>
<p>‘There’ll be no murder, and not even a broken head,’
she said. ‘Our men are thirty to four of them: no harm will
be done at all.’</p>
<p>‘Then there <i>is</i> an attack!’ exclaimed Stockdale;
‘and you knew it was to be. Why should you side with men
who break the laws like this?’</p>
<p>‘Why should you side with men who take from country traders
what they have honestly bought wi’ their own money in France?’
said she firmly.</p>
<p>‘They are not honestly bought,’ said he.</p>
<p>‘They are,’ she contradicted. ‘I and Owlett
and the others paid thirty shillings for every one of the tubs before
they were put on board at Cherbourg, and if a king who is nothing to
us sends his people to steal our property, we have a right to steal
it back again.’</p>
<p>Stockdale did not stop to argue the matter, but went quickly in the
direction of the noise, Lizzy keeping at his side. ‘Don’t
you interfere, will you, dear Richard?’ she said anxiously, as
they drew near. ‘Don’t let us go any closer: ‘tis
at Warm’ell Cross where they are seizing ‘em. You
can do no good, and you may meet with a hard blow!’</p>
<p>‘Let us see first what is going on,’ he said. But
before they had got much further the noise of the cartwheels began again;
and Stockdale soon found that they were coming towards him. In
another minute the three carts came up, and Stockdale and Lizzy stood
in the ditch to let them pass.</p>
<p>Instead of being conducted by four men, as had happened when they
went out of the village, the horses and carts were now accompanied by
a body of from twenty to thirty, all of whom, as Stockdale perceived
to his astonishment, had blackened faces. Among them walked six
or eight huge female figures, whom, from their wide strides, Stockdale
guessed to be men in disguise. As soon as the party discerned
Lizzy and her companion four or five fell back, and when the carts had
passed, came close to the pair.</p>
<p>‘There is no walking up this way for the present,’ said
one of the gaunt women, who wore curls a foot long, dangling down the
sides of her face, in the fashion of the time. Stockdale recognized
this lady’s voice as Owlett’s.</p>
<p>‘Why not?’ said Stockdale. ‘This is the public
highway.’</p>
<p>‘Now look here, youngster,’ said Owlett. ‘O,
‘tis the Methodist parson!—what, and Mrs. Newberry!
Well, you’d better not go up that way, Lizzy. They’ve
all run off, and folks have got their own again.’</p>
<p>The miller then hastened on and joined his comrades. Stockdale
and Lizzy also turned back. ‘I wish all this hadn’t
been forced upon us,’ she said regretfully. ‘But if
those excisemen had got off with the tubs, half the people in the parish
would have been in want for the next month or two.’</p>
<p>Stockdale was not paying much attention to her words, and he said,
‘I don’t think I can go back like this. Those four
poor excisemen may be murdered for all I know.’</p>
<p>‘Murdered!’ said Lizzy impatiently. ‘We don’t
do murder here.’</p>
<p>‘Well, I shall go as far as Warm’ell Cross to see,’
said Stockdale decisively; and, without wishing her safe home or anything
else, the minister turned back. Lizzy stood looking at him till
his form was absorbed in the shades; and then, with sadness, she went
in the direction of Nether-Moynton.</p>
<p>The road was lonely, and after nightfall at this time of the year
there was often not a passer for hours. Stockdale pursued his
way without hearing a sound beyond that of his own footsteps; and in
due time he passed beneath the trees of the plantation which surrounded
the Warm’ell Cross-road. Before he had reached the point
of intersection he heard voices from the thicket.</p>
<p>‘Hoi-hoi-hoi! Help, help!’</p>
<p>The voices were not at all feeble or despairing, but they were unmistakably
anxious. Stockdale had no weapon, and before plunging into the
pitchy darkness of the plantation he pulled a stake from the hedge,
to use in case of need. When he got among the trees he shouted—’What’s
the matter—where are you?’</p>
<p>‘Here,’ answered the voices; and, pushing through the
brambles in that direction, he came near the objects of his search.</p>
<p>‘Why don’t you come forward?’ said Stockdale.</p>
<p>‘We be tied to the trees!’</p>
<p>‘Who are you?’</p>
<p>‘Poor Will Latimer the exciseman!’ said one plaintively.
‘Just come and cut these cords, there’s a good man.
We were afraid nobody would pass by to-night.’</p>
<p>Stockdale soon loosened them, upon which they stretched their limbs
and stood at their ease.</p>
<p>‘The rascals!’ said Latimer, getting now into a rage,
though he had seemed quite meek when Stockdale first came up.
”Tis the same set of fellows. I know they were Moynton
chaps to a man.’</p>
<p>‘But we can’t swear to ‘em,’ said another.
‘Not one of ‘em spoke.’</p>
<p>‘What are you going to do?’ said Stockdale.</p>
<p>‘I’d fain go back to Moynton, and have at ‘em again!’
said Latimer.</p>
<p>‘So would we!’ said his comrades.</p>
<p>‘Fight till we die!’ said Latimer.</p>
<p>‘We will, we will!’ said his men.</p>
<p>‘But,’ said Latimer, more frigidly, as they came out
of the plantation, ‘we don’t <i>know</i> that these chaps
with black faces were Moynton men? And proof is a hard thing.’</p>
<p>‘So it is,’ said the rest.</p>
<p>‘And therefore we won’t do nothing at all,’ said
Latimer, with complete dispassionateness. ‘For my part,
I’d sooner be them than we. The clitches of my arms are
burning like fire from the cords those two strapping women tied round
‘em. My opinion is, now I have had time to think o’t,
that you may serve your Gover’ment at too high a price.
For these two nights and days I have not had an hour’s rest; and,
please God, here’s for home-along.’</p>
<p>The other officers agreed heartily to this course; and, thanking
Stockdale for his timely assistance, they parted from him at the Cross,
taking themselves the western road, and Stockdale going back to Nether-Moynton.</p>
<p>During that walk the minister was lost in reverie of the most painful
kind. As soon as he got into the house, and before entering his
own rooms, he advanced to the door of the little back parlour in which
Lizzy usually sat with her mother. He found her there alone.
Stockdale went forward, and, like a man in a dream, looked down upon
the table that stood between him and the young woman, who had her bonnet
and cloak still on. As he did not speak, she looked up from her
chair at him, with misgiving in her eye.</p>
<p>‘Where are they gone?’ he then said listlessly.</p>
<p>‘Who?—I don’t know. I have seen nothing of
them since. I came straight in here.’</p>
<p>‘If your men can manage to get off with those tubs, it will
be a great profit to you, I suppose?’</p>
<p>‘A share will be mine, a share my cousin Owlett’s, a
share to each of the two farmers, and a share divided amongst the men
who helped us.’</p>
<p>‘And you still think,’ he went on slowly, ‘that
you will not give this business up?’</p>
<p>Lizzy rose, and put her hand upon his shoulder. ‘Don’t
ask that,’ she whispered. ‘You don’t know what
you are asking. I must tell you, though I meant not to do it.
What I make by that trade is all I have to keep my mother and myself
with.’</p>
<p>He was astonished. ‘I did not dream of such a thing,’
he said. ‘I would rather have swept the streets, had I been
you. What is money compared with a clear conscience?’</p>
<p>‘My conscience is clear. I know my mother, but the king
I have never seen. His dues are nothing to me. But it is
a great deal to me that my mother and I should live.’</p>
<p>‘Marry me, and promise to give it up. I will keep your
mother.’</p>
<p>‘It is good of you,’ she said, trembling a little.
‘Let me think of it by myself. I would rather not answer
now.’</p>
<p>She reserved her answer till the next day, and came into his room
with a solemn face. ‘I cannot do what you wished!’
she said passionately. ‘It is too much to ask. My
whole life ha’ been passed in this way.’ Her words
and manner showed that before entering she had been struggling with
herself in private, and that the contention had been strong.</p>
<p>Stockdale turned pale, but he spoke quietly. ‘Then, Lizzy,
we must part. I cannot go against my principles in this matter,
and I cannot make my profession a mockery. You know how I love
you, and what I would do for you; but this one thing I cannot do.’</p>
<p>‘But why should you belong to that profession?’ she burst
out. ‘I have got this large house; why can’t you marry
me, and live here with us, and not be a Methodist preacher any more?
I assure you, Richard, it is no harm, and I wish you could only see
it as I do! We only carry it on in winter: in summer it is never
done at all. It stirs up one’s dull life at this time o’
the year, and gives excitement, which I have got so used to now that
I should hardly know how to do ‘ithout it. At nights, when
the wind blows, instead of being dull and stupid, and not noticing whether
it do blow or not, your mind is afield, even if you are not afield yourself;
and you are wondering how the chaps are getting on; and you walk up
and down the room, and look out o’ window, and then you go out
yourself, and know your way about as well by night as by day, and have
hairbreadth escapes from old Latimer and his fellows, who are too stupid
ever to really frighten us, and only make us a bit nimble.’</p>
<p>‘He frightened you a little last night, anyhow: and I would
advise you to drop it before it is worse.’</p>
<p>She shook her head. ‘No, I must go on as I have begun.
I was born to it. It is in my blood, and I can’t be cured.
O, Richard, you cannot think what a hard thing you have asked, and how
sharp you try me when you put me between this and my love for ‘ee!’</p>
<p>Stockdale was leaning with his elbow on the mantelpiece, his hands
over his eyes. ‘We ought never to have met, Lizzy,’
he said. ‘It was an ill day for us! I little thought
there was anything so hopeless and impossible in our engagement as this.
Well, it is too late now to regret consequences in this way. I
have had the happiness of seeing you and knowing you at least.’</p>
<p>‘You dissent from Church, and I dissent from State,’
she said. ‘And I don’t see why we are not well matched.’</p>
<p>He smiled sadly, while Lizzy remained looking down, her eyes beginning
to overflow.</p>
<p>That was an unhappy evening for both of them, and the days that followed
were unhappy days. Both she and he went mechanically about their
employments, and his depression was marked in the village by more than
one of his denomination with whom he came in contact. But Lizzy,
who passed her days indoors, was unsuspected of being the cause: for
it was generally understood that a quiet engagement to marry existed
between her and her cousin Owlett, and had existed for some time.</p>
<p>Thus uncertainly the week passed on; till one morning Stockdale said
to her: ‘I have had a letter, Lizzy. I must call you that
till I am gone.’</p>
<p>‘Gone?’ said she blankly.</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ he said. ‘I am going from this place.
I felt it would be better for us both that I should not stay after what
has happened. In fact, I couldn’t stay here, and look on
you from day to day, without becoming weak and faltering in my course.
I have just heard of an arrangement by which the other minister can
arrive here in about a week; and let me go elsewhere.’</p>
<p>That he had all this time continued so firmly fixed in his resolution
came upon her as a grievous surprise. ‘You never loved me!’
she said bitterly.</p>
<p>‘I might say the same,’ he returned; ‘but I will
not. Grant me one favour. Come and hear my last sermon on
the day before I go.’</p>
<p>Lizzy, who was a church-goer on Sunday mornings, frequently attended
Stockdale’s chapel in the evening with the rest of the double-minded;
and she promised.</p>
<p>It became known that Stockdale was going to leave, and a good many
people outside his own sect were sorry to hear it. The intervening
days flew rapidly away, and on the evening of the Sunday which preceded
the morning of his departure Lizzy sat in the chapel to hear him for
the last time. The little building was full to overflowing, and
he took up the subject which all had expected, that of the contraband
trade so extensively practised among them. His hearers, in laying
his words to their own hearts, did not perceive that they were most
particularly directed against Lizzy, till the sermon waxed warm, and
Stockdale nearly broke down with emotion. In truth his own earnestness,
and her sad eyes looking up at him, were too much for the young man’s
equanimity. He hardly knew how he ended. He saw Lizzy, as
through a mist, turn and go away with the rest of the congregation;
and shortly afterwards followed her home.</p>
<p>She invited him to supper, and they sat down alone, her mother having,
as was usual with her on Sunday nights, gone to bed early.</p>
<p>‘We will part friends, won’t we?’ said Lizzy, with
forced gaiety, and never alluding to the sermon: a reticence which rather
disappointed him.</p>
<p>‘We will,’ he said, with a forced smile on his part;
and they sat down.</p>
<p>It was the first meal that they had ever shared together in their
lives, and probably the last that they would so share. When it
was over, and the indifferent conversation could no longer be continued,
he arose and took her hand. ‘Lizzy,’ he said, ‘do
you say we must part—do you?’</p>
<p>‘You do,’ she said solemnly. ‘I can say no
more.’</p>
<p>‘Nor I,’ said he. ‘If that is your answer,
good-bye!’</p>
<p>Stockdale bent over her and kissed her, and she involuntarily returned
his kiss. ‘I shall go early,’ he said hurriedly.
‘I shall not see you again.’</p>
<p>And he did leave early. He fancied, when stepping forth into
the grey morning light, to mount the van which was to carry him away,
that he saw a face between the parted curtains of Lizzy’s window,
but the light was faint, and the panes glistened with wet; so he could
not be sure. Stockdale mounted the vehicle, and was gone; and
on the following Sunday the new minister preached in the chapel of the
Moynton Wesleyans.</p>
<p>One day, two years after the parting, Stockdale, now settled in a
midland town, came into Nether-Moynton by carrier in the original way.
Jogging along in the van that afternoon he had put questions to the
driver, and the answers that he received interested the minister deeply.
The result of them was that he went without the least hesitation to
the door of his former lodging. It was about six o’clock
in the evening, and the same time of year as when he had left; now,
too, the ground was damp and glistening, the west was bright, and Lizzy’s
snowdrops were raising their heads in the border under the wall.</p>
<p>Lizzy must have caught sight of him from the window, for by the time
that he reached the door she was there holding it open: and then, as
if she had not sufficiently considered her act of coming out, she drew
herself back, saying with some constraint, ‘Mr. Stockdale!’</p>
<p>‘You knew it was,’ said Stockdale, taking her hand.
‘I wrote to say I should call.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, but you did not say when,’ she answered.</p>
<p>‘I did not. I was not quite sure when my business would
lead me to these parts.’</p>
<p>‘You only came because business brought you near?’</p>
<p>‘Well, that is the fact; but I have often thought I should
like to come on purpose to see you ... But what’s all this that
has happened? I told you how it would be, Lizzy, and you would
not listen to me.’</p>
<p>‘I would not,’ she said sadly. ‘But I had
been brought up to that life; and it was second nature to me.
However, it is all over now. The officers have blood-money for
taking a man dead or alive, and the trade is going to nothing.
We were hunted down like rats.’</p>
<p>‘Owlett is quite gone, I hear.’</p>
<p>‘Yes. He is in America. We had a dreadful struggle
that last time, when they tried to take him. It is a perfect miracle
that he lived through it; and it is a wonder that I was not killed.
I was shot in the hand. It was not by aim; the shot was really
meant for my cousin; but I was behind, looking on as usual, and the
bullet came to me. It bled terribly, but I got home without fainting;
and it healed after a time. You know how he suffered?’</p>
<p>‘No,’ said Stockdale. ‘I only heard that
he just escaped with his life.’</p>
<p>‘He was shot in the back; but a rib turned the ball.
He was badly hurt. We would not let him be took. The men
carried him all night across the meads to Kingsbere, and hid him in
a barn, dressing his wound as well as they could, till he was so far
recovered as to be able to get about. He had gied up his mill
for some time; and at last he got to Bristol, and took a passage to
America, and he’s settled in Wisconsin.’</p>
<p>‘What do you think of smuggling now?’ said the minister
gravely.</p>
<p>‘I own that we were wrong,’ said she. ‘But
I have suffered for it. I am very poor now, and my mother has
been dead these twelve months ... But won’t you come in, Mr.
Stockdale?’</p>
<p>Stockdale went in; and it is to be supposed that they came to an
understanding; for a fortnight later there was a sale of Lizzy’s
furniture, and after that a wedding at a chapel in a neighbouring town.</p>
<p>He took her away from her old haunts to the home that he had made
for himself in his native county, where she studied her duties as a
minister’s wife with praiseworthy assiduity. It is said
that in after years she wrote an excellent tract called <i>Render unto
Caesar; or, The Repentant Villagers</i>, in which her own experience
was anonymously used as the introductory story. Stockdale got
it printed, after making some corrections, and putting in a few powerful
sentences of his own; and many hundreds of copies were distributed by
the couple in the course of their married life.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 1879.</p>

<!-- CHAPTER XXXIII <br> BY THE PLANTING -->
<p>
There is no sensation more delightful than that which results from the consciousness of having got one’s own way. Mrs. Musgrave was very happy. She had persuaded Armour, and, what was much more important, she had persuaded her husband, that it was really imperative to delay the arrangements for Ellie’s marriage. Delay was everything in her opinion; because she was convinced that with a little time her daughter would feel the advantages of becoming Mrs. Fenwick, the mistress of an ancestral home, and the representative of a ‘county family.’ 
</p>
<p>
It had certainly been rather painful to bear the evident distress of Ellie, although she had behaved submissively enough. But all things considered, she had every reason to be satisfied with the result of her day’s diplomatic exertions; and being sustained by the consciousness that she was doing ber duty she went to bed with an easy mind.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Musgrave, however, was not an early bird, and had no suspicion that her plans might be interfered with in consequence.
</p>
<p>
Armour was well contented with matters as they stood. He had come, as he believed, to a complete understanding with his future mother-in-law; and that he counted a great gain. At the expense of much self-sacrifice he had obeyed her behest, and had remained away from the house on the evening on which he had expected to see Ellie. But the request did not apply to the following morning; and, knowing Ellie’s habit of generally accompanying her father part of the way towards his office, he was out betimes and waiting by the planting in the expectation of meeting her.
</p>
<p>
Presently he saw them come forth from the side gate of Torthorl, and he advanced joyously towards them.
</p>
<p>
Think of a beautiful landscape, dull under mist which is suddenly cleared away by the sun: think of the heavy drops of dew in an instant transformed into diamonds by the light suddenly flashed upon them — that was Ellie’s face when she saw her lover.
</p>
<p>
She drew her arm from her father’s and almost ran towards him.
</p>
<p>
The father noted this, and although his pace had been slow before, it became slower now as he purposely hung back. Presently he found something the matter with one of the young trees which compelled him to stop. But his inspection was brief; he decided that there was nothing particular the matter with the plant, and he might leave it to the care of nature. So he could go on.
</p>
<p>
‘I am rather in a hurry this morning,’ he said as he approached the two, before their hands which had clasped in greeting were parted. There was something unusually grave in his voice and manner, which was rendered the more marked by the attempt to assume his jocose smile. ‘And I dare say you young folk will not be very sorry... . . I hope you don’t mean to try to make me believe that you are... . That’s right. I aye keep in mind that two are company and a third party is always in the way. I’ll see you later, Armour, probably.’
</p>
<p>
Then he passed on with long, hurried steps.
</p>
<p>
Armour grasped her hand again, and would have kissed her, but that he was checked by the strange expression of anxiety with which she looked after her father.
</p>
<p>
‘What is the matter with him?’ she said as if speaking to herself, and yet turning to Armour.
</p>
<p>
‘Only some case which is worrying him,’ was the gleeful reply; ‘some vagabond has escaped his clutches, and he is annoyed about it. Never you heed, he will get hold of the vagabond soon, and then he’ll be as merry as ever.’
</p>
<p>
‘No,’ said Ellie slowly and thoughtfully; ‘it is something about us that is troubling him. I cannot make out what it is, but he said to me last night that —’
</p>
<p>
She was puzzled how to explain the strange words which haunted her; but she felt that having gone so far she must complete the sentence in order to satisfy Armour. So she went on hesitatingly,
</p>
<p>
‘He said that perhaps it would be as well that you did not come here at present.’
</p>
<p>
She felt awkward in saying this, but she was astounded by the manner in which it was received. Armour for an instant looked abashed; then he laughed.
</p>
<p>
‘I know what is the matter,’ he cried confidently.
</p>
<p>
‘Tell me,’ was her eager exclamation.
</p>
<p>
‘The grey mare,’ he replied with great solemnity.
</p>
<p>
‘What!’
</p>
<p>
‘The grey mare,’ he repeated, trying to look more solemn than before, and holding up his hand with the forefinger extended as if about to deliver some admonition. ‘Now I am going to look into the future, and what do you think I see there?’
</p>
<p>
‘I don’t know,’ she answered, half amused and still perplexed about her father.
</p>
<p>
‘I see a man they call John Armour, with a grey pow and a portly person, who is supposed to be a man who has a will of his own — that is outside his house. Then I see inside the house a bonnie, gentlelooking lady they call Ellie Armour, who is supposed to be so sweet that she has no will of her own. But I see that same John Armour a perfect slave to her wishes, just because she is so sweet and so dear to him. Do you understand yet?’
</p>
<p>
‘Not quite.’
</p>
<p>
‘Well, the whole matter is this: your father wants to please your mother, and he wants to please you too. At this minute he does not see how he is to manage it, because it is her wish that you should not marry me. But he does not know that your mother and I have entered into a solemn league and convenant, and we are perfectly agreed upon all its conditions.’
</p>
<p>
‘My mother and you agreed!’ exclaimed Ellie bewildered.
</p>
<p>
‘Yes, and the conditions are perfectly fair. They involve everything that I desire  — your happiness.’
</p>
<p>
‘Did she say so?’
</p>
<p>
‘Of course she did, and I mean to help her with all my might to that end. What she wants is fair and reasonable, and it comes to nothing more than this, that you yourself are to decide whether you are to find happiness with me or no.’
</p>
<p>
‘But I have decided, and she says I’m wrong.’
</p>
<p>
‘No, no; she only says that your present conviction may be a mistake, and that you must have time to make quite sure that it is not so. I say grant the time — do you think it will make any difference?’
</p>
<p>
His face was beaming with confidence; he was smiling with the satisfaction of one who knows he is granting a concession which costs him nothing. Her face brightened, too, and the disengaged hand was placed on his arm.
</p>
<p>
‘No time can make any difference in me,’ she said simply.
</p>
<p>
And then —
</p>
<p>
Well, they were by the planting; there was a calm sough among the trees, and there were no eyes of people or houses upon them.
</p>
<p>
They walked to and fro along the side of the planting; and they were happy although they did not speak very much. Perhaps they were happiest in those moments of perfect silence when they walked side by side full of the sense of each other’s presence, and so, quite content. These are the momenta in which love is fullest of sweet imaginings: the brain is active with tender thoughts, and the mental eye is full of pleasant visions of a long and happy future.
</p>
<p>
What a pity these are only moments!
</p>
<p>
But fortunately in these moments there is concentrated the life of years; and it is worth living to realise them. So Armour and Ellie would have thought, had they not been too blessed in the present to reflect about it at all. One enjoys the perfume of a rose without pausing to speculate upon its source. Love grants brief spans of perfect happiness, and the lovers do not stay to inquire too curiously into the reason why.
</p>
<p>
He was there: that was enough for her. She was there: that was enough for him. Father and mother and all the world were forgotten by them: they only knew that they were together, and believed that they might be thus walking through life with the bright morning sun upon them and the pleasant aroma of the green trees about them.
</p>
<p>
What did they care about the calculations of Mrs Musgrave, founded upon her narrow experience of ordinary men and women? May-be she was right so far as concerned <em>them</em>. Undoubtedly she meant well, and was actuated by a pure motive. But they did not belong to the ordinary category. They were lovers, and all the commonplace ordinances of the world must yield to their love.
</p>
<p>
Listen to those birds: did ever birds sing so sweetly! Look at those trees: how fresh and fragrant they were. Look at this green field stretching down to the river; and look at the cows leisurely browsing or stolidly gazing at nothing. Was there ever a field so green -- were there ever cows so contented -- was there ever water gleamed so beautifully as the field and the cows and the river which appeared through the halo of their love?
</p>
<p>
They were very happy that morning, and the memory of it was a treasure to them afterwards.

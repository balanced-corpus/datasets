<title>Chapter 44 of MARCELLA by WARD</title>
<!-- Chapter 44 -->
<p>“I think I saw the letters arrive,” said Mrs. Boyce to her daughter. “And Donna Margherita seems to be signalling to us.”</p>

<p>“Let me go for them, mamma.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, I must go in.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Boyce rose from her seat, and went slowly towards the hotel.
Marcella watched her widow’s cap and black dress as they passed along
the <i>pergola</i> of the hotel garden, between bright masses of geraniums
and roses on either side.</p>

<p>They had been sitting in the famous garden of the Cappucini Hotel at
Amalfi. To Marcella’s left, far below the high terrace of the hotel, the
green and azure of the Salernian gulf shone and danced in the sun, to
her right a wood of oak and arbutus stretched up into a purple cliff — a wood starred above with gold and scarlet berries, and below with
cyclamen and narcissus. From the earth under the leafy oaks — for the
oaks at Amalfi lose and regain their foliage in winter and spring by imperceptible gradations — came a moist English smell. The air was damp and warm. A convent bell tolled from invisible heights above the garden; while the olives and vines close at hand were full of the chattering voices of gardeners and children, and broken here and there by clouds of pink almond-blossom. March had just begun, and the afternoons were fast lengthening. It was little more than a fortnight since Mr. Boyce’s death. In the November of the preceding year Mrs. Boyce and Marcella had brought him to Naples by sea, and there, at a little villa on Posilippo,
he had drawn sadly to his end. It had been a dreary time, from which
Marcella could hardly hope that her mother would ever fully recover. She
herself had found in the long months of nursing — nursing of which, with
quiet tenacity, she had gradually claimed and obtained her full share — a
deep moral consolation. They had paid certain debts to conscience, and
they had for ever enshrined her father’s memory in the silence of an
unmeasured and loving pity.</p>

<p>But the wife? Marcella sorely recognised that to her mother these last
days had brought none of the soothing, reconciling influences they had
involved for herself. Between the husband and wife there had been dumb
friction and misery — surely also a passionate affection! — to the end.
The invalid’s dependence on her had been abject, her devotion wonderful.
Yet, in her close contact with them, the daughter had never been able to
ignore the existence between them of a wretched though tacit
debate — reproach on his side, self-defence or spasmodic effort on
hers — which seemed to have its origin deep in the past, yet to be
stimulated afresh by a hundred passing incidents of the present. Under
the blight of it, as under the physical strain of nursing, Mrs. Boyce
had worn and dwindled to a white-haired shadow; while he had both clung
to life and feared death more than would normally have been the case.
At the end he had died in her arms, his head on her breast; she had
closed his eyes and performed every last office without a tear; nor had
Marcella ever seen her weep from then till now. The letters she had
received, mostly, Marcella believed, from her own family, remained
unopened in her travelling-bag. She spoke very little, and was
constantly restless, nor could Marcella as yet form any idea of the
future.</p>

<p>After the funeral at Naples Mrs. Boyce had written immediately to her
husband’s solicitor for a copy of his will and a statement of affairs.
She had then allowed herself to be carried off to Amalfi, and had there,
while entirely declining to admit that she was ill, been clearly doing
her best to recover health and nerve sufficient to come to some
decision, to grapple with some crisis which Marcella also felt to be
impending — though as to why it should be impending, or what the nature
of it might be, she could only dread and guess.</p>

<p>There was much bitter yearning in the girl’s heart as she sat, breathed
on by the soft Italian wind blowing from this enchanted sea. The inner
cry was that her mother did not love her, had never loved her, and might
even now — weird, incredible thought! — be planning to desert her. Hallin
was dead — who else was there that cared for her or thought of her? Betty
Macdonald wrote often, wild, “<i>schwärmerisch</i>” letters. Marcella looked
for them with eagerness, and answered them affectionately. But Betty
must soon marry, and then all that would be at an end. Meanwhile Marcella knew well it was Betty’s news that made Betty’s adoration doubly welcome. Aldous Raeburn — she never did or could think of him
under his new name — was apparently in London, much occupied in politics,
and constantly, as it seemed, in Betty’s society. What likelihood was
there that her life and his would ever touch again? She thought often of
her confession to Hallin, but in great perplexity of feeling. She had,
of course, said no word of secrecy to him at the time. Such a demand in
a man’s last hour would have been impossible. She had simply followed a
certain mystical love and obedience in telling him what he asked to
know, and in the strong spontaneous impulse had thought of nothing
beyond. Afterwards her pride had suffered fresh martyrdom. Could he,
with his loving instinct, have failed to give his friend some sign? If
so, it had been unwelcome, for since the day of Hallin’s funeral she and
Aldous had been more complete strangers than before. Lady Winterbourne,
Betty, Frank Leven, had written since her father’s death; but from him,
nothing.</p>

<p>By the way, Frank Leven had succeeded at Christmas, by old Sir Charles
Leven’s unexpected death, to the baronetcy and estates. How would that
affect his chances with Betty? — if indeed there were any such chances
left.</p>

<p>As to her own immediate future, Marcella knew from many indications that
Mellor would be hers at once. But in her general tiredness of mind and
body she was far more conscious of the burden of her inheritance than of
its opportunities. All that vivid castle-building gift which was
specially hers, and would revive, was at present in abeyance. She had
pined once for power and freedom, that she might make a Kingdom of
Heaven of her own, quickly. Now power and freedom, up to a certain
point, were about to be put into her hands; and instead of plans for
acting largely and bountifully on a plastic outer world, she was saying
to herself, hungrily, that unless she had something close to her to love
and live for, she could do nothing. If her mother would end these
unnatural doubts, if she would begin to make friends with her own
daughter, and only yield herself to be loved and comforted, why <i>then</i>
it might be possible to think of the village and the straw-plaiting!
Otherwise — the girl’s attitude as she sat dreaming in the sun showed her
despondency.</p>

<p>She was roused by her mother’s voice calling her from the other end of
the <i>pergola</i>.</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma.”</p>

<p>“Will you come in? There are some letters.”</p>

<p>“It is the will,” thought Marcella, as Mrs. Boyce turned back to the
hotel, and she followed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyce shut the door of their sitting-room, and then went up to her
daughter with a manner which suddenly struck and startled Marcella.
There was natural agitation and trouble in it.</p>

<p>“There is something in the will, Marcella, which will, I fear, annoy and
distress you. Your father inserted it without consulting me. I want to
know what you think ought to be done. You will find that Lord Maxwell
and I have been appointed joint executors.”</p>

<p>Marcella turned pale.</p>

<p>“Lord Maxwell!” she said, bewildered. “<i>Lord Maxwell—Aldous</i>! What do
you mean, mamma?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyce put the will into her hands, and, pointing the way among the
technicalities she had been perusing while Marcella was still lingering
in the garden, showed her the paragraph in question. The words of the
will were merely formal: “I hereby appoint,” &c., and no more; but in a
communication from the family solicitor, Mr. French, which Mrs. Boyce
silently handed to her daughter after she had read the legal
disposition, the ladies were informed that Mr. Boyce had, before
quitting England, written a letter to Lord Maxwell, duly sealed and
addressed, with instructions that it should be forwarded to its
destination immediately after the writer’s burial. “Those instructions,”
said Mr. French, “I have carried out. I understand that Lord Maxwell was
not consulted as to his appointment as executor prior to the drawing up
of the will. But you will no doubt hear from him at once, and as soon as
we know that he consents to act, we can proceed immediately to probate.”</p>

<p>“Mamma, how <i>could</i> he?” said Marcella, in a low, suffocated voice,
letting will and letter fall upon her knee.</p>

<p>“Did he give you no warning in that talk you had with him at Mellor?” said Mrs. Boyce, after a minute’s silence.</p>

<p>“Not the least,” said Marcella, rising restlessly and beginning to walk
up and down. “He spoke to me about wishing to bring it on again — asked
me to let him write. I told him it was all done with — for ever! As to my
own feelings, I felt it was no use to speak of them; but I thought — I
<i>believed</i>, I had proved to him that Lord Maxwell had absolutely given
up all idea of such a thing; and that it was already probable he would
marry some one else. I told him I would rather disappear from every one
I knew than consent to it — he could only humiliate us all by saying a
word. And <i>now</i>, after that!—”</p>

<p>She stopped in her restless walk, pressing her hands miserably together.</p>

<p>“What <i>does</i> he want with us and our affairs?” she broke out. “He
wishes, of course, to have no more to do with me. And now we force
him — <i>force</i> him into these intimate relations. What can papa have said
in that letter to him? What <i>can</i> he have said? Oh! it is unbearable! Can’t we write at once?”</p>

<p>She pressed her hands over her eyes in a passion of humiliation and
disgust. Mrs. Boyce watched her closely.</p>

<p>“We must wait, anyway, for his letter,” she said. “It ought to be here
by to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>Marcella sank on a chair by an open glass door, her eyes wandering,
through the straggling roses growing against the wall of the stone
balcony outside, to the laughing purples and greens of the sea.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she said unhappily, “it is most probable he will consent.
It would not be like him to refuse. But, mamma, you must write. <i>I</i> must
write and beg him not to do it. It is quite simple. We can manage
everything for ourselves. Oh! how <i>could</i> papa?” she broke out again in
a low wail, “how could he?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyce’s lips tightened sharply. It seemed to her a foolish
question. <i>She</i>, at least, had had the experience of twenty years out of
which to answer it. Death had made no difference. She saw her husband’s
character and her own seared and broken life with the same tragical
clearness; she felt the same gnawing of an affection not to be plucked
out while the heart still beat. This act of indelicacy and injustice was
like many that had gone before it; and there was in it the same evasion
and concealment towards herself. No matter. She had made her account
with it all twenty years before. What astonished her was, that the force
of her strong coercing will had been able to keep him for so long within
the limits of the smaller and meaner immoralities of this world.</p>

<p>“Have you read the rest of the will?” she asked, after a long pause.</p>

<p>Marcella lifted it again, and began listlessly to go through it.</p>

<p>“Mamma!” she said presently, looking up, the colour flushing back into
her face, “I find no mention of you in it throughout. There seems to be
no provision for you.”</p>

<p>“There is none,” said Mrs. Boyce, quietly. “There was no need. I have my
own income. We lived upon it for years before your father succeeded to
Mellor. It is therefore amply sufficient for me now.”</p>

<p>“You cannot imagine,” cried Marcella, trembling in every limb, “that I
am going to take the whole of my father’s estate, and leave
nothing — <i>nothing</i> for his wife. It would be impossible — unseemly. It
would be to do <i>me</i> an injustice, mamma, as well as yourself,” she added
proudly.</p>

<p>“No, I think not,” said Mrs. Boyce, with her usual cold absence of
emotion. “You do not yet understand the situation. Your father’s
misfortunes nearly ruined the estate for a time. Your grandfather went
through great trouble, and raised large sums to — ” she paused for the
right phrase — “to free us from the consequences of your father’s
actions. I benefited, of course, as much as he did. Those sums crippled
all your grandfather’s old age. He was a man to whom I was
attached — whom I respected. Mellor, I believe, had never been
embarrassed before. Well, your uncle did a little towards recovery — but
on the whole he was a fool. Your father has done much more, and you, no
doubt, will complete it. As for me, I have no claim to anything more
from Mellor. The place itself is ” — again she stopped for a word of which
the energy, when it came, seemed to escape her — “hateful to me. I shall
feel freer if I have no tie to it. And at last I persuaded your father
to let me have my way.”</p>

<p>Marcella rose from her seat impetuously, walked quickly across the room,
and threw herself on her knees beside her mother.</p>

<p>“Mamma, are you still determined — now that we two are alone in the
world — to act towards me, to treat me as though I were not your
daughter — not your child at all, but a stranger?”</p>

<p>It was a cry of anguish. A sudden slight tremor swept over Mrs. Boyce’s
thin and withered face. She braced herself to the inevitable.</p>

<p>“Don’t let us make a tragedy of it, my dear,” she said, with a light
touch on Marcella’s hands. “Let us discuss it reasonably. Won’t you sit
down? I am not proposing anything very dreadful. But, like you, I have
some interests of my own, and I should be glad to follow them — now — a
little. I wish to spend some of the year in London; to make that,
perhaps, my headquarters, so as to see something of some old friends
whom I have had no intercourse with for years — perhaps also of my
relations.” She spoke of them with a particular dryness. “And I should
be glad — after this long time — to be somewhat taken out of oneself, to
read, to hear what is going on, to feed one’s mind a little.”</p>

<p>Marcella, looking at her, saw a kind of feverish light, a sparkling
intensity in the pale blue eyes, that filled her with amazement. What,
after all, did she know of this strange individuality from which her own
being had taken its rise? The same flesh and blood — what an irony of
nature!</p>

<p>“Of course,” continued Mrs. Boyce, “I should go to you, and you would
come to me. It would only be for part of the year. Probably we should
get more from each other’s lives so. As you know, I long to see things
as they are, not conventionally. Anyway, whether I were there or no, you
would probably want some companion to help you in your work and plans. I
am not fit for them. And it would be easy to find some one who could act
as chaperon in my absence.”</p>

<p>The hot tears sprang to Marcella’s eyes. “Why did you send me away from
you, mamma, all my childhood,” she cried. “It was wrong — cruel. I have
no brother or sister. And you put me out of your life when I had no
choice, when I was too young to understand.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyce winced, but made no reply. She sat with her delicate hand
across her brow. She was the white shadow of her former self; but her
fragility had always seemed to Marcella more indomitable than anybody
else’s strength.</p>

<p>Sobs began to rise in Marcella’s throat.</p>

<p>“And now,” she said, in half-coherent despair, “do you know what you are
doing? You are cutting yourself off from me — refusing to have any real
bond to me just when I want it most. I suppose you think that I shall be
satisfied with the property and the power, and the chance of doing what
I like. But ” — she tried her best to gulp back her pain, her outraged
feeling, to speak quietly — “I am not like that really any more. I can
take it all up, with courage and heart, if you will stay with me, and
let me — let me — love you and care for you. But, by myself, I feel as if
I could not face it! I am not likely to be happy — for a long
time — except in doing what work I can. It is very improbable that I
shall marry. I dare say you don’t believe me, but it is true. We are
both sad and lonely. We have no one but each other. And then you talk in
this ghastly way of separating from me — casting me off.”</p>

<p>Her voice trembled and broke, she looked at her mother with a frowning
passion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyce still sat silent, studying her daughter with a strange,
brooding eye. Under her unnatural composure there was in reality a
half-mad impatience, the result of physical and moral reaction. This
beauty, this youth, talk of sadness, of finality! What folly! Still, she
was stirred, undermined in spite of herself.</p>

<p>“There!” she said, with a restless gesture, “let us, please, talk of it
no more. I will come back with you — I will do my best. We will let the
matter of my future settlement alone for some months, at any rate, if
that will satisfy you or be any help to you.”</p>

<p>She made a movement as though to rise from her low chair. But the great
waters swelled in Marcella — swelled and broke. She fell on her knees
again by her mother, and before Mrs. Boyce could stop her she had thrown
her young arms close round the thin, shrunken form.</p>

<p>“Mother!” she said. “Mother, be good to me — love me — you are all I
have!”</p>

<p>And she kissed the pale brow and cheek with a hungry, almost a violent
tenderness that would not be gainsaid, murmuring wild incoherent things.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyce first tried to put her away, then submitted, being physically
unable to resist, and at last escaped from her with a sudden sob that
went to the girl’s heart. She rose, went to the window, struggled hard
for composure, and finally left the room.</p>

<p>But that evening, for the first time, she let Marcella put her on the
sofa, tend her, and read to her. More wonderful still, she went to sleep
while Marcella was reading. In the lamplight her face looked piteously
old and worn. The girl sat for long with her hands clasped round her
knees, gazing down upon it, in a trance of pain and longing.</p>

<hr>

<p>Marcella was awake early next morning, listening to the full voice of
the sea as it broke three hundred feet below, against the beach and
rocky walls of the little town. She was lying in a tiny white room, one
of the cells of the old monastery, and the sun as it rose above the
Salernian mountains — the mountains that hold Paestum in their blue and
purple shadows — danced in gold on the white wall. The bell of the
cathedral far below tolled the hour. She supposed it must be six
o’clock. Two hours more or so, and Lord Maxwell’s letter might be looked
for.</p>

<p>She lay and thought of it — longed for it, and for the time of answering
it, with the same soreness that had marked all the dreams of a restless
night. If she could only see her father’s letter! It was inconceivable
that he should have mentioned <i>her</i> name in his plea. He might have
appealed to the old friendship between the families. That was possible,
and would have, at any rate, an <i>appearance</i> of decency. But who could
answer for it — or for him? She clasped her hands rigidly behind her
head, her brows frowning, bending her mind with an intensity of will to
the best means of assuring Aldous Raeburn that she and her mother would
not encroach upon him. She had a perpetual morbid vision of herself as
the pursuer, attacking him now through his friend, now through her
father. Oh! when would that letter come, and let her write her own!</p>

<p>She tried to read, but in reality listened for every sound of awakening
life in the hotel. When at last her mother’s maid came in to call her,
she sprang up with a start.</p>

<p>“Deacon, are the letters come?”</p>

<p>“There are two for your mother, miss; none for you.”</p>

<p>Marcella threw on her dressing-gown, watched her opportunity, and
slipped in to her mother, who occupied a similar cell next door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyce was sitting up in bed, with a letter before her, her pale
blue eyes fixed absently on the far stretch of sea.</p>

<p>She looked round with a start as Marcella entered. “The letter is to me,
of course,” she said.</p>

<p>Marcella read it breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Boyce, — I have this morning received from your solicitor, Mr.
French, a letter written by Mr. Boyce to myself in November of last
year. In it he asks me to undertake the office of executor, to which, I
hear from Mr. French, he has named me in his will. Mr. French also
enquires whether I shall be willing to act, and asks me to communicate
with you.</p>

<p>“May I, then, venture to intrude upon you with these few words? Mr.
Boyce refers in his touching letter to the old friendship between our
families, and to the fact that similar offices have often been performed
by his relations for mine, or <i>vice versa</i>. But no reminder of the kind
was in the least needed. If I can be of any service to yourself and to
Miss Boyce, neither your poor husband nor you could do me any greater
kindness than to command me.</p>

<p>“I feel naturally some diffidence in the matter. I gather from Mr.
French that Miss Boyce is her father’s heiress, and comes at once into
the possession of Mellor. She may not, of course, wish me to act, in
which case I should withdraw immediately; but I sincerely trust that she
will not forbid me the very small service I could so easily and gladly
render.</p>

<p>“I cannot close my letter without venturing to express the deep
sympathy I have felt for you and yours during the past six months. I
have been far from forgetful of all that you have been going through,
though I may have seemed so. I trust that you and your daughter will not
hurry home for any business cause, if it is still best for your health
to stay in Italy. With your instructions Mr. French and I could arrange
everything.</p>

  <p>“Believe me,</p>

  <p>“Yours most sincerely,</p>

  <p>“MAXWELL.”</p>

<p>“You will find it difficult, my dear, to write a snub in answer to that
letter,” said Mrs. Boyce, drily, as Marcella laid it down.</p>

<p>Marcella’s face was, indeed, crimson with perplexity and feeling.</p>

<p>“Well, we can think it over,” she said as she went away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyce pondered the matter a good deal when she was left alone. The
signs of reaction and change in Marcella were plain enough. What they
precisely meant, and how much, was another matter. As to him, Marcella’s
idea of another attachment might be true, or might be merely the
creation of her own irritable pride. Anyway, he was in the mood to write
a charming letter. Mrs. Boyce’s blanched lip had all its natural irony
as she thought it over. To her mind Aldous Raeburn’s manners had always
been a trifle too good, whether for his own interests or for this wicked
world. And if he had any idea now of trying again, let him, for
Heaven’s sake, not be too yielding or too eager! “It was always the
way,” thought Mrs. Boyce, remembering a child in white frock and baby
shoes — “if you wished to make her want anything, you had to take it away
from her.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the mere thought that matters might even yet so settle
themselves drew from the mother a long breath of relief. She had spent
an all but sleepless night, tormented by Marcella’s claim upon her.
After twenty years of self-suppression this woman of forty-five,
naturally able, original, and independent, had seen a glimpse of
liberty. In her first youth she had been betrayed as a wife, degraded as
a member of society. A passion she could not kill, combined with some
stoical sense of inalienable obligation, had combined to make her both
the slave and guardian of her husband up to middle life; and her family
and personal pride, so strong in her as a girl, had found its only
outlet in this singular estrangement she had achieved between herself
and every other living being, including her own daughter. Now her
husband was dead, and all sorts of crushed powers and desires, mostly of
the intellectual sort, had been strangely reviving within her. Just
emerged, as she was, from the long gloom of nursing, she already wished
to throw it all behind her — to travel, to read, to make
acquaintances — she who had lived as a recluse for twenty years! There
was in it a last clutch at youth, at life. And she had no desire to
enter upon this new existence — in comradeship with Marcella. They were
independent and very different human beings. That they were mother and
daughter was a mere physical accident.</p>

<p>Moreover, though she was amply conscious of the fine development in
Marcella during the past two years, it is probable that she felt her
daughter even less congenial to her now than of old. For the rich,
emotional nature had, as we have seen, “suffered conviction,” had turned
in the broad sense to “religion,” was more and more sensitive,
especially since Hallin’s death, to the spiritual things and symbols in
the world. At Naples she had haunted churches; had read, as her mother
knew, many religious books.</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Boyce in these matters had a curious history. She had begun
life as an ardent Christian, under evangelical influences. Her husband,
on the other hand, at the time she married him was a man of purely
sceptical opinions, a superficial disciple of Mill and Comte, and fond
of an easy profanity which seemed to place him indisputably with the
superior persons of this world. To the amazement and scandal of her
friends, Evelyn Merritt had not been three months his wife before she
had adopted his opinions <i>en bloc</i>, and was carrying them out to their
logical ends with a sincerity and devotion quite unknown to her teacher.
Thenceforward her conception of things — of which, however, she seldom
spoke — had been actively and even vehemently rationalist; and it had
been one of the chief sorenesses and shames of her life at Mellor that,
in order to suit his position as country squire, Richard Boyce had sunk
to what, in her eyes, were a hundred mean compliances with things
orthodox and established.</p>

<p>Then, in his last illness, he had finally broken away from her, and his
own past. “Evelyn, I should like to see a clergyman,” he had said to
her in his piteous voice, “and I shall ask him to give me the
Sacrament.” She had made every arrangement accordingly; but her bitter
soul could see nothing in the step but fear and hypocrisy; and he knew
it. And as he lay talking alone with the man whom they had summoned, two
or three nights before the end, she, sitting in the next room, had been
conscious of a deep and smarting jealousy. Had not the hard devotion of
twenty years made him at least her own? And here was this black-coated
reciter of incredible things stepping into her place. Only in death she
recovered him wholly. No priest interfered while he drew his last breath
upon her bosom.</p>

<p>And now Marcella! Yet the girl’s voice and plea tugged at her withered
heart. She felt a dread of unknown softnesses — of being invaded and
weakened by things in her akin to her daughter, and so captured afresh.
Her mind fell upon the bare idea of a revival of the Maxwell engagement,
and caressed it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Marcella stood dressing by the open window in the sunlight,
which filled the room with wavy reflections caught from the sea.
Fishing-boats were putting off from the beach, three hundred feet below
her; she could hear the grating of the keels, the songs of the boatmen.
On the little breakwater to the right an artist’s white umbrella shone
in the sun; and a half-naked boy, poised on the bows of a boat moored
beside the painter, stood bent in the eager attitude of one about to
drop the bait into the blue wave below. His brown back burnt against the
water. Cliff, houses, sea, glowed in warmth and light; the air was full
of roses and orange-blossom; and to an English sense had already the
magic of summer.</p>

<p>And Marcella’s hands, as she coiled and plaited her black hair, moved
with a new lightness; for the first time since her father’s death her
look had its normal fire, crossed every now and then by something that
made her all softness and all woman. No! as her mother said, one could
not snub that letter or its writer. But how to answer it! In imagination
she had already penned twenty different replies. How not to be grasping
or effusive, and yet to show that you could feel and repay
kindness — there was the problem!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, from that letter, or rather in subtle connection with it, her
thoughts at last went wandering off with a natural zest to her new realm
of Mellor, and to all that she would and could do for the dwellers
therein.</p>

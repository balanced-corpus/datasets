<!-- MR. HARRISON'S CONFESSIONS. <br> CHAPTER I -->
<p>
The fire was burning gaily. My wife had just gone upstairs to put baby to bed. Charles sat opposite to me, looking very brown and handsome. It was pleasant enough that we should feel sure of spending some weeks under the same roof, a thing which we had never done since we were mere boys. I felt too lazy to talk, so I ate walnuts and looked into the fire. But Charles grew restless.
</p>
<p>
“Now that your wife is gone upstairs, Will, you must tell me what I’ve wanted to ask you ever since I saw her this morning. Tell me all about the wooing and winning. I want to have the receipt for getting such a spicy little wife of my own. Your letters only gave the barest details. So set to, man, and tell me every particular.
</p>
<p>
“If I tell you all, it will be a long story.”
</p>
<p>
“Never fear. If I get tired, I can go to sleep, and dream that I am back again, a lonely bachelor, in Ceylon; and I can waken up when you have done, to know that I am under your roof. Dash away, man! ‘Once upon a time, a gallant young bachelor—’ There’s a beginning for you!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, then, ‘once upon a time, a gallant young bachelor’ was sorely puzzled where to settle, when he had completed his education as a surgeon. —I must speak in the first person; I cannot go on as a gallant young bachelor. — I had just finished walking the hospitals when you went to Ceylon, and, if you remember, I wanted to go abroad like you, and thought of offering myself as a ship-surgeon; but I found I should rather lose castein in my profession; so I hesitated, and while I was hesitating, I received a letter from my father’s cousin, Mr. Morgan, — that old gentleman who used to write such long letters of good advice to my mother, and who tipped me a five-pound note when I agreed to be bound apprentice to Mr. Howard, instead of going to sea. Well, it seems the old gentleman had all along thought of taking me as his partner, if I turned out pretty well; and as he heard a good account of me from an old friend of his, who was a surgeon at Guy’s, he wrote to propose this arrangement: I was to have a third of the profits for five years; after that, half; and eventually I was to succeed to the whole. It was no bad offer for a penniless man like me, as Mr. Morgan had a capital country practice, and, though I did not know him personally, I had formed a pretty good idea of him, as an honourable, kind-hearted, fidgetty, meddlesome old bachelor; and a very correct notion it was, as I found out in the very first half-hour of seeing him. I had had some idea that I was to live in his house, as he was a bachelor and a kind of family friend; and I think he was afraid that I should expect this arrangement, for when I walked up to his door, with the porter carrying my portmanteau, he met me on the steps, and while he held my hand and shook it, he said to the porter, ‘Jerry, if you’ll wait a moment, Mr. Harrison will be ready to go with youto his lodgings, at Jocelyn’s, you know;’ and then turning to me, he addressed his first words of welcome. I was a little inclined to think him inhospitable, but I got to understand him better afterwards. ‘Jocelyn’s,’ said he, ‘is the best place I have been able to hit upon in a hurry, and there is a good deal of fever about, which made me desirous that you should come this month, — a low kind of typhoid, in the oldest part of the town. I think you’ll be comfortable there for a week or two. I have taken the liberty of desiring my housekeeper to send down one or two things which give the place a little more of a home aspect, — an easy chair, a beautiful ease of preparations, and one or two little matters in the way of eatables; but if you’ll take my advice, I’ve a plan in my head which we will talk about to-morrow morning. At present, I don’t like to keep you standing out on the steps here, so I’ll not detain you from your lodgings, where I rather think my housekeeper is gone to get tea ready for you.’
</p>
<p>
“I thought I understood the old gentleman’s anxiety for his own health, which he put upon care for mine, for he had on a kind of loose grey coat, and not hat on his head. But I wondered that he did not ask me in-doors, instead of keeping me on the steps. I believe, after all, I made a mistake in supposing he was afraid of taking cold; he was only afraid of being seen in <em>dishabille</em>. And for his apparent inhospitality, I had not been long in Duncombe before I understood the comfort of having one’s house considered as a castle into which no one might intrude, and saw good reason for the practice Mr. Morgan had established of coming to his door to speak to every one. It was only the effect of habit that made him receive me so. Before long, I had the free run of his house.
</p>
<p>
“There was every sign of kind attention and forethought on the part of some one, whom I could not doubt to be Mr. Morgan, in my lodgings. I was too lazy to do much that evening, and sat in the little bow-window which projected over Jocelyn’s shop, looking up and down the street. Duncombe calls itself a town, but I should call it a village. Really, looking from Jocelyn’s, it is a very picturesque place. The houses are anything but regular; they may be mean in their details; but altogether they look well; they have not that flat unrelieved front, which many towns of far more pretentions present. Here and there a bow-window — every now and then a gable, cutting up against the sky — occasionally a projecting upper story — throws good effect of light and shadow along the street; and they have a queer fashion of their own of colouring the whitewash of some of the houses with a sort of pink blotting-paper tinge, more like the stone of which Mayence is built than anything else. It may be very bad taste, but to my mind it gives a rich warmth to the colouring. Then, here and there a dwelling-house has a court in front, with a grass-plot on each side of the flagged walk, and a large tree or two — limes or horse-chestnuts — which send their great projecting upper branches over into the street, making round dry places of shelter on the pavement in the times of summer showers.
</p>
<p>
“While I was sitting in the bow-window, thinking of the contrast between this place and the lodgings in the heart of London, which I had left only twelve hours before, — the window open here, and, although in the centre of the town, admitting only scents from the mignonette boxes on the sill, instead of the dust and smoke of — Street, — the only sound heard in this, the principal street, being the voices of mothers calling their playing children home to bed, and the eight o’clock bell of the old parish church bimbomming in remembrance of the curfew; — while I was sitting thus idly, the door opened, and the little maid-servant, dropping a courtesy, said —
</p>
<p>
“‘Please, sir, Mrs. Munton’s compliments, and she would be glad to know how you are after your journey.’
</p>
<p>
“There! was not that hearty and kind? Would even the dearest chum I had at Guy’s have thought of doing such a thing? while Mrs. Munton, whose name I had never heard of before, was doubtless suffering anxiety till I could relieve her mind by sending back word that I was pretty well.
</p>
<p>
“‘My compliments to Mrs. Munton, and I am pretty well: much obliged to her.’ It was as well to say only ‘pretty well,’ for ‘very well’ would have destroyed the interest Mrs. Munton evidently felt in me. Good Mrs. Munton! Kind Mrs. Munton! Perhaps, also, young, —handsome, —rich, —widowed Mrs. Munton! I rubbed my hands with delight and amusement, and resuming my post of observation, began to wonder at which house Mrs. Munton lived.
</p>
<p>
“Again the little tap, and the little maid-servant:
</p>
<p>
“‘Please, sir, Miss Tomkinsons’ compliments, and they would be glad to know how you feel yourself after your journey.’
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know why, but Miss Tomkinsons’ name had not such a halo about it as MRs. Munton’s. Still it was very pretty in Miss Tomkinsons to send and inquire. I only wished I did not feel so perfectly robust. I was almost ashamed that I could not send word I was quite exhausted by fatigue, and had fainted twice since my arrival. If I had but had a headache, at least! I heaved a deep breath: my chest was in perfect order; I had caught no cold; so I answered again —
</p>
<p>
“‘Much obliged to the Miss Tomkinsons; I am not much fatigued; tolerably well; my compliments.’
</p>
<p>
“Little Sally could hardly have got downstairs, before she returned, bright and breathless: —
</p>
<p>
“‘Mr. and Mrs. Bullock’s compliments, sir, and they hope you are pretty well after your journey.’
</p>
<p>
“Who would have expected such kindness from such an unpromising name? Mr. and Mrs. Bullock were less interesting, it is true, than their predecessors; but I graciously replied —
</p>
<p>
“‘My compliments; a night’s rest will perfectly recruit me.’
</p>
<p>
“The same message was presently brought up from one or two more unknown kind hearts. I really wished I were not so ruddy-looking. I was afraid I should disappoint the tender-hearted town when they saw what a hale young fellow I was. And I was almost ashamed of confessing to a great appetite for supper when Sally came up to inquire what I would have. Beef-steaks were so tempting; but perhaps I ought rather to have water-gruel, and go to bed. The beef-steak carried the day, however. I need not have felt such a gentle elation of spirits, as this mark of the town’s attention is paid to every one when they arrive after a journey. Many of the same people have sent to inquire after you, —great, hulking, brown fellow as you are, —only Sally spared you the infliction of deviating interesting answers.

<!-- chapter title "Husband and Wife" -->
<p>The Callanders had gone and the house was quiet. Stratheldon had not stirred from his rooms. The door opening upon the suite he occupied when in retirement was kept scrupulously locked. Mrs. Callander had made several attempts to penetrate to him, but she was, in every instance, inexorably denied. His lordship was indisposed. His lordship was much occupied with his writing. His lordship had been reading late into the night and was now resting, Morgan insisted, respectfully, but with his tall height planted firmly in the doorway.</p>
<p>“I believe that man never sleeps,” Mrs. Callander reported, angrily. “Whatsoever time one goes he is always on guard, and, if Stratheldon ordered it, would cheerfully throw one over the staircase. Thank heaven Tony is tolerably nimble with his fists !” She wrote notes marked “imperative !” but though doubtless the contents were as insistent as she superscribed the envelopes she received no answers beyond those which were in Morgan’s respectful and restrained verbiage.”</p>
<p>And the Callanders had engagements which compelled them to return to town. Renée was thankful enough to see that the last of her provoking sister-in-law, whose temper and malice had reached a climax since Stratheldon’s retirement. But she sent a little regretful sigh after Tony’s broad shoulders, as she watched the carriage down the drive. Tony had been very good to her, and his presence seemed to safeguard her against the terrors of the house.</p>
<p>“Leslie’s the best chap in the world,” he said to her at parting. “But he don’t see enough life. Got too many notions. Try to have patience with him,” he enjoined, with a rueful smile.”</p>
<p>“You <em>poor</em> thing !” Mrs. Tony cried, with a dramatic shutter, proffered her cheek. “If you like to come with us even now at the last moment—”</p>
<p>But Renée disregarded the cheek and the suggestion. She still looked upon Mrs. Tony as the prime cause of her distress. For the first terror had been robbed of some of its sharpness by her later discovery.</p>
<p>Lancelot had departed earlier with Dr. Ram—Lancelot, who had proved another disappointment. For Lancelot, whether instigated by his mother, or acting from dislike, had sturdily resisted all her overtures.</p>
<p>So Renée was feeling sorely rejected by this family it had seemed so vast a privilege to enter, as she sat in the reactionary quiet of the Callander’s departure that morning of it.</p>
<p>The house was quiet in all truth. She shuddered in the great deserted drawing-room. The house was certainly not unlike the tomb he styled it.</p>
<p>“I shall throw you and Stratheldon on your own resources,” Mrs. Quintin said, airily. “So you will best rub down one another’s angles.”</p>
<p>“As though that were all !” had sighed Renée. For Renée, with a strength and discretion beyond her years had kept her own sore counsel, and Mrs. Quintin had no notion of the true facts of these lofty circumstances whereto her daughter had been elevated.</p>
<p>Chance took the girl some mornings subsequent to the Callanders’ departure to the bench beside the river. It was a mild, unseasonable day—seeing that December frost and cold were due, and she sat for some minutes in the old place.</p>
<p>History seemed to be repeating itself when presently she heard the well-known jarring rhythm and Stratheldon appeared approaching in his chair. His mien was one of the deepest dejection. His face was alarmingly pale. He looked like a man recovering from grave illness.</p>
<p>Stratheldon eyed her strangely as she went to meet him—eyed her as though she had been from a world wherewith he had lost touch. Then he came to himself. He stopped the chair and remained silent, searching her face.</p>
<p>“You were wishing it all undone,” he said, gloomily. “Well, it has been a mistake. Human persons are not pawns upon a chess-board, that one may play them in a game. But there were compensations, and I thought you might have made yourself content. I did not mean to throw my ugly life across your path, child.”</p>
<p>She was touched by his dejection, melted that he should so abase himself. “Oh, let us be friends !” she cried, on an impulse. “Once we were friends. And you talked with me, and read to me, and I seemed to me something to you. Can we not be as we once were, now that she has gone?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “There is knowledge between us now, Renée. Then you imagined me something I assured you I was not. Now you see me as a monster.”</p>
<p>“No,” she cried—”no. It is natural that she should be more to you than I. You have known her for so long. It is natural you should not have thought of me.”</p>
<p>He raised his head. His eyes travelled over her fair beauty. “No,” he said, with a melancholy smile, “it is unnatural. Nevertheless, it is true. Habit is stronger than nature.”</p>
<p>He broke off short. Then he murmured, more to himself than her : “Child—child, if you but knew what a lame, unhappy wretch your monster is !”</p>
<p>She found nothing to say. With that power he had over her, the power compounded of his strength, his mind, his aloofness, and the tragedy surrounding him, she was moved to weep, to touch his hand, even to lay her soft young cheek against the lean darkness of his, in sign of sympathy.</p>
<p>But he was so isolate, so self-centered, so iron-bound in his solitariness. She dared show no sign. She stood before him, speechless and timid. He was like a man enringed by rock, defended by the rampart he raised about him, of will, of unconformity, and segregation. Withersoever he went he carried isolation with him—isolation which was like an armor buckled on.</p>
<p>“If I could do anything for you,” she faltered, presently. “If I could help you—”</p>
<p>“Help me by being happy, dear,” he said, gently. “Don’t put the crime of a spoiled life upon me. I had thought you had little to lose. Let me see that at least you do not lose that little. My act was the act of a fool, for it appears that you have gained as little as it appears I have done.”</p>
<p>After a silence : “There is nothing you or anybody can do for me, Renée,” he said, with a dull smile. “Science has supplemented my disability. I move, if I wish, more rapidly than others walk. For the rest, I am a sour, disaffected fellow, fit only for a tub or cave. There is nothing I want. There is nothing anybody can do for me. I have everything—far more than I require. I am a hermit by inclination ; it is only one of the multiple mistakes for which fate is conspicuous that has made me titled, rich, and idle. There is nothing money buys for which I care.”</p>
<p>“But you look ill,” she urged.</p>
<p>“If I were ill,” he said, grimly, “it might be better for me. As it is, I do not know the meaning of the term. If it mean to be rid of fretting energy, if it mean ability to lie like a log with a spent brain, then heaven send me illness ! As I am the last person in the world to profit by wealth, so I am the last person in the world to have his forces tied by an accursed lameness to a cradle. And now,” he concluded, briefly, “I have discharged my conjugal debt. I have told you more about myself than I have told any other. I have been a dutiful husband. I shall not bore you again with long speeches. But do not suppose my burden insupportable. Only a fool or a coward shirks the disabilities which make all lives on long, interminable disability—only a fool or a coward, weaker than our friend the worm. For our friend the worm, if you remember, Renée, goes on groping, groping, tilling the ground for his arch-enemy, man, who presently rewards him with the spade or cruel heel.”</p>
<p>“But repentance,” Renée submitted, impulsively—”if a man has done wrong and has repented, does it not wipe out the wrong? There must be forgiveness somewhere.”</p>
<p>“Nothing is ever wiped out,” he asserted, with a harsh laugh. “In the whole range of being there is no such factor as atonement. Every act, good or bad, sets certain waves of effect rippling till all time. Nothing that is done can ever be undone. No effect can be reabsorbed into its cause.”</p>
<p>“But,” she ventured, opposing her girlish theologies to these inexorable fatalisms, “if a man has once done something that was wrong, can he not make up for it by doing right?”</p>
<p>“Who shall say which is the right, and which the wrong?” he said. “The thing that seems right may entail a whole series of wrongs. How then, Renée?”</p>
<p>“Oh, well,” she insisted, shaking a golden head, “one can only do what seems to him or to her to be right, you know. If wrong comes of it, must be somebody else’s fault, or some fault in the way things are arranged.”</p>
<p>“There speaks my philosopher,” he said, a little smile creeping out from the shadows of his mouth. “And is my philosopher once more my friend?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, eagerly. “I cannot live in anything but friendliness. And it would be dismally lonely for me here in this great house if we were not to be friends.”</p>
<p>After a silence: “You must get companions,” he urged, with sudden energy. “I never intended to make you nun counterpart to my monk. Fill the house, if you wish it. I shall never interfere with you. I am much in my rooms.”</p>
<p>“What do you do there?” she submitted. “I passed the door the other day and wondered. I looked up to your windows. But even on Tuesday, when the day was so beautiful and the trees were hung with frost as though they had been trimmed with lace, I did not see you.”</p>
<p>He smiled. “No,” he said ; “I am not much at my windows.”</p>
<p>“It would have done you good to be out,” she urged. “I took a long walk—almost to the old mill. It was delicious.”</p>
<p>“For those who can walk.”</p>
<p>“Well, you might have come with me in your chair,” she maintained ; “you cannot walk, and that, I suppose, has to be faced. The only thing to do is to make the best of it. And I should think the chair must be very comfortable.”</p>
<p>“For workers and weaklings,” he said, peevishly.</p>
<p>She ignored the peevishness. “It cannot be good always to come to this same place,” she said. “It would take your mind off your troubles, I think, if you were to go a different way.”</p>
<p>“But supposing I should take my mind with me. How then, Renée?”</p>
<p>She shook her head at him with sudden boldness. She smiled him a radiant smile. “You must leave it at home,” she said. “It must be a very tiresome mind to be always thinking the same thing.”</p>
<p>He stared at her. “The same thing,” he echoed. His tone was almost nettled. “Do you know I am writing a book upon the evolution of the soul? Do you suppose it contains but one idea?”</p>
<p>“Well, mind you don’t let the foot get into it,” she counselled, saucily. But her heart was in her mouth. Suppose he should tower up angrily and scold her.</p>
<p>He maintained a silence, distinctly mortified. It was a small sentiment for so large a person. It sat awkwardly upon him.</p>
<p>Then : “My Lady Stratheldon is pleased to be impertinent,” he said, grimly.</p>
<p>“Oh, you make too much of it,” she deprecated—”really you do. You would be much happier if you would only forget it. Other people are lame, and some are blind, and some are absolutely helpless.”</p>
<p>“And set me an example in fortitude.”</p>
<p>“Well, I know you have other troubles,” she said.</p>
<p>“Indeed. And what do you know about it?” He turned sharply upon her. “What other troubles have I?”</p>
<p>For a moment she was nonplussed. But the necessity for concealment lent her aid.</p>
<p>“One might think,” she responded, nimbly—”one might easily suppose you had some trouble on your mind.”</p>
<p>“Cease to suppose it,” he said, curtly. “Cease to consider my affairs at all.”</p>
<p>“Now you are angry.”</p>
<p>“No,” he said, impatiently. “But it is irksome to have persons probing one for mysteries. It is tiresome to be watched.”</p>
<p>There was a minute’s silence. Then : “Shall we return?” he suggested. He turned a glance skyward. “It is half-past one. But perhaps your imaginative fancy overlooks the commonplace of lunch.”</p>
<p>“Is the sky your watch?”</p>
<p>He pointed below them. “The river is my dial. When the shadow of the bridge lies parallel with the willow-stem it is one o’clock.”</p>
<p>They proceeded in silence, Renée finding little to say. She was embarrassed by the sense of her escape. She must not again so venture.</p>
<p>But she mustered her resources during lunch, chattering girlish fancies.</p>
<p>The mantle of seclusion was upon him. Sometimes he responded, more frequently he did not ; sometimes he did not even pretend to listen. But he lingered, smoking a cigarette above his coffee.</p>
<p>“And what does Kerleigh say now about its ugly duckling?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “Your prediction has come true,” she cried, gayly. “I have wings and a long, fine, snowy neck. I have blossomed into a sawn.”</p>
<p>“You mix your metaphors,” he objected, irritably. “Ducklings and swans do not blossom.” After a moment : “You see what a sour fellow I am, fit only for a cell and for books whose diction is above reproach.”</p>
<p>“I suppose people grow like that—in a cell,” she said, regarding him reflectively between the fringes of her long lashes. “Because really, you know, it was not of the slightest consequence so long as you understood what I meant.”</p>
<p>“You assuredly are the most ingenuous of philosophers,” he stated, staring at her.</p>
<p>He rose presently to leave. He turned at the door. “I shall not see you again to-day,” he said, with a half-smile. “I must finish a long chapter this evening.”</p>
<p>“But you must dine.”</p>
<p>“I dine in my cell.”</p>
<p>She mustered courage. “It will be horribly lonely for me,” she submitted, “to dine by myself in the great dining-hall with two men to wait on me.”</p>
<p>“Use some other and smaller room, and give instructions that only Meadows waits.”</p>
<p>“May I not dine with you?” She followed him across the room and stood before him, looking up with wistful eyes.</p>
<p>“In the cell,” he said, slowly, “on bread and herbs?”</p>
<p>She made little gesture of protest. “I can eat bread,” she asserted, “if there is nothing better. But we might have a pudding.”</p>
<p>The eyes upturned to him gleamed with a spark of coquetry. The white chin tilted mischievously.</p>
<p>He drew away from her, though his eye dwelled on her.</p>
<p>Suddenly he hardened. “No,” he said, “I cannot have you in the cell.”</p>
<p>He quitted the room, to return some minutes later.</p>
<p>“I tell you you must get friends,” he insisted. “I cannot have your loneliness upon my conscience. You will be moped to death. Even had I time—or inclination, I am no companion for you. Pray write at once and fill the house with friends.”</p>
<p>She had resumed her seat at the table. She sat with her chin in the cup of her hands.</p>
<p>“I prefer not,” she said, quietly. “I have no friends in Kerleigh. I know nobody but Kerleigh people and school-fellows.</p>
<p>“Invite your school-fellows, then. I suppose they are sufficiently grown up,” he added, with a species of helplessness, “to come without their mothers. Or you might invite the mothers.”</p>
<p>Renée smiled—a girlish smile—at the man’s simplicity. “Oh, they are sufficiently grown up,” she said; “but I want neither them nor their mothers. I don’t want anybody.”</p>
<p>“For Heaven’s sake be reasonable,” he protested. “You cannot live your life alone.”</p>
<p>“Let me try,” she said.</p>
<p>He stood looking down upon her, nonplussed. She was such a very small pawn that one would scarcely anticipate trouble from her checkmating.</p>
<p>“Are you obstinate?”</p>
<p>“I hope not,” she retorted, cheerfully.</p>
<p>“Then for Heaven’s sake be reasonable. You can be philosophic enough where other people’s affairs are concerned.”</p>
<p>She shook her shining head. “I think I am being philosophic,” she said. “If you are always going to leave me by myself I must learn to like being left by myself.”</p>
<p>He moved to a chair. He sat down opposite to her, perplexity and discomfiture in his face. “In the name of all that is provoking, what is to be done with you if you will not make the best of things?”</p>
<p>“I am trying to,” she insisted. “Since you leave me alone, I will try to enjoy being left alone.”</p>
<p>“What nonsense it is! How can a child like you enjoy being alone? You need somebody, of course, to—to play with.”</p>
<p>“I have given up skipping-ropes.”</p>
<p>He eyed her gloomily. “I am afraid you are obstinate,” he said. “You must know what I mean. I should have said you need somebody for companionship. There are the billiard and ball rooms; there are covered Badminton and tennis-courts; there are horses feeding their heads off in the stables ; there are carriages mildewing in the coach-houses—you cannot amuse yourself alone. For goodness’ sake be sensible, and fill the house with people. For goodness’ sake don’t afflict me with this nightmare of a healthy young woman walled up in a life of isolation and penance. You have everything to make yourself happy; anything you have not you have but to ask for.”</p>
<p>“Why,” she insisted, smiling, “I am no lonelier here than I was at home. Then I had only mother, and she did not play with me. And I can have mother now by walking across the park.</p>
<p>“This is a most horrible complication,” he said. He drummed his fists reflectively upon the table. “It is strange how things out of books, things that seem absolutely simple, suddenly and unexpectedly assume aggravating proportions and beset one. Who would have imagined she would not have set about making herself happy?”</p>
<p>She smiled at the helpless distress of him. His strong, sardonic face was crumpled with vexation.</p>
<p>“I am going to make myself happy,” she objected ; “and I will not be a horrible complication. I am fond of reading and walking, and I have my violin and piano, and there is always the park.”</p>
<p>“I have it,” he cried, brightening: “you must ride. Riding is the one thing, at all events, one can enjoy alone. Do you ride?”</p>
<p>“I learned at school,” she said.</p>
<p>“Then we will get you a hack. There is nothing suitable in the stable, and you shall choose a hack for yourself.”</p>
<p>He rose with an air of cheerfulness. He seemed almost elated by this genius inspiration. “You shall ride instead of moping,” he said, “and my conscience will be rid of some of its load; and no doubt, as time goes on, you will yield your obstinacy and invite your friends.”</p>
<p>He smiled her a relieved smile and left her. His step was buoyant upon the master-stroke wherewith he had settled the problem of her life. His lameness was scarcely perceptible.</p>
<p>“Now, how stupid—stupid!” Renée reflected after him. “How can a person so clever suppose that all a companionship a girl wants can be supplied by a horse?”</p>
<p>For Renée had yet to learn how very unintelligent on some points one’s intellectual superior may be!</p>
<p>But the horse was procured—a most admirable hack in all respects—and Renée went riding. And oftentimes as she went riding, with the groom at his decorous distance behind her, she reflected how very stupid so clever a man as Stratheldon might be.</p>
<p>Most days Stratheldon lunched with her, and some days dined. Oftentimes he sat down with abstraction in his eyes and mutterings upon his lips.</p>
<p>“Were you speaking to me?” she inquired of him once, as he had stared at her, moving his lips.</p>
<p>He came to himself. “Was I speaking? It was not conversation. I was merely sounding an alliterative metaphor for the heading of a chapter.”</p>
<p>“Must you be always thinking of things that are a thousand miles away?” she sighed. “Isn’t it very tiresome to live with your head in a book?”</p>
<p>“Tiresome?” he said. “Life otherwise would be a hell. What else does life hold?”</p>
<p>“Things,” she said; “people and things, sunshine and flowers, and music and happiness.”</p>
<p>“These are scarcely in my line,” he asserted, grimly.</p>
<p>“You do not even notice my new frock,” she chid him, playfully, yet wistfully.</p>
<p>They were seated at dinner, and Renée wore a white a gold “creation” which had occasioned its creator one sleepless night at least.</p>
<p>He brought his eyes from abstract introspections, turning them upon her in sudden vision. His eyes rested upon the charming throat and shoulders, and her white arms. The gold embroideries of the dress were repeated in the glinting of her hair.</p>
<p>“You are a very beautiful person,” he said gravely. His eyes lingered on her. “I have never denied that you are a very beautiful person.”</p>
<p>The dejection of him smote her. She stretched a timid hand and touched his arm.</p>
<p>“Oh, are you a little fond of me?” she cried, impulsively.</p>
<p>He drew away. He rose abruptly from his chair. “God forbid!” he cried, harshly, staring down on her with straining eyes. “It would be a crime, dear,” he added, seeing the sudden pallor of her face. “Never try to make me care for you. There are reasons that would make my love a crime.”</p>
<p>He turned and dragged himself away. With the opening of the door a sound between a sigh and groan travelled back to her. Then he was gone.</p>
<p>“How could it be a crime to care for me?” she reflected, indignantly. “Isn’t it more a crime to care for Margaret?”</p>

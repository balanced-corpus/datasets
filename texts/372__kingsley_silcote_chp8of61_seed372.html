<!--chapter title: CHAPTER VIII: <br> PAR NOBILE FRATUUM.-->

<p>Algernon’s modest allowance of 250<i>l</i>. a year had
been continued through the usual channel, all through
the time of his curacy, but, when he entered on
the duties of his incumbency, he was informed by
his father’s lawyer that it would be discontinued.
He submitted, with a sigh, without remonstrance or
remark, and gave up all hope of assistance from that
quarter. It was not that he proudly made any
resolution against accepting it; it merely seemed to
him utterly improbable that such help would ever
be offered, and utterly impossible that he should ever
ask for it. </p>

<p>But many apparent impossibilities have been done
for the sake of children. When he began to see that
he was poor, and getting poorer, the thought of their
future was quite enough to set aside any lingering
feelings of pride or fear, had any such been there.
He put his case through his lawyer, and was refused.
Old Silcote wished it to be understood that he could
hold no further communication with Mr. Algernon
Silcote.</p>

<p>Once, not long after this, the children fell ill of
measles, or some childish disorder, and a sad time the
poor widower had with them, and was still thanking
God that they were on the mend, and that he had
lost none of his precious little incumbrances, when a
message came from Silcotes, ordering the children to
be sent there for change of air, until they recovered
their health. The message came through Silcote’s
lawyer, and was given in as ill-conditioned a manner as
need be, but Algernon had no “proper spirit” whatever.
He thankfully sent the children off, and they
were kept there for above two months. He was very
thankful. “The ban then is not to descend to the
next generation,” he said. He thanked God for it.</p>

<p>The younger of his two visitors at Oxford, the bright-eyed
young Arthur, now grown to be the man we
saw him at Silcotes the night of the poaching affray,
paid him frequent visits as of yore. It was he who
brought the children back from Silcotes, with new
clothes, new toys, new roses in their cheeks, and, alas,
new wants and a new discontent at the squalid and
untidy home to which they had returned. Arthur,
who noticed everything, noticed Miss Dora turning
up her nose at several things, and heard one or two
petulant remarks from her in strong disparagement of
the <i>ménage</i> at No. 20, Lancaster Square; and he said
with his usual decision, “I shall stay a few days with
you, Algy. Dora, you are tired with your journey,
and consequently cross and disagreeable. Go to bed.
No, leave your doll here. I want it.” </p>

<p>Dora obeyed, reddening. “I’ll stay a day or two,
and whip these children in. They have been most
awfully spoilt by that very foolish aunt of ours. You
will require the aid of my influence for a short time,
until hers has become a thing of the past. What a
noble child that Dora is! Every element of good
about her. She has a will, and requires to have it
controlled by a stronger one. But she is a sweet
child.”</p>

<p>“Dora,” said Algernon, with perfect good faith,
“reminds me, in all her ways, of her mother.”</p>

<p>Arthur was just going to rap out in his short way,
“Lord forbid.” But he neither did that, nor what
he felt inclined to do a moment afterwards—burst
out laughing: he was getting that tongue of his under
command by now.</p>

<p>“Well, she is a very sweet child, and Reggy is
another. Reggy is an artist. Reggy will do great
things in art. Reggy will be a Royal Academician,
if those old dunderheads can ever be got to overcome
their inveterate jealousy against anything approaching
to talent and originality.”</p>

<p>Algy answered in commonplaces, not quite knowing
what words he was uttering, for he was confusedly
wondering how an undergraduate could have such
wonderful intuition about an art of which he was
entirely ignorant, as to see a future Royal Academician
in a child of nine, whose efforts hitherto had
been certainly below the average. But it was only
Arthur, he thought again with a smile,—Arthur the
omniscient.</p>

<p>Arthur went on. “I love and admire everything
you do, but I never admired you more than when
you gave up your pride, and allowed these children
to pay this visit.” </p>

<p>“I have no pride, Archy,” said Algernon. “And,
if I had, I could not display it in that quarter.”</p>

<p>Arthur looked at him keenly, and asked, “Why?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean on general grounds—on the ground
that you have no right to be proud to your own
father—or that you have no right to stand in your
children’s light? Or are there other grounds for your
not being proud?”</p>

<p>“The reasons,” said Algernon, “on which I acted
in sending my children to their grandfather at Silcotes
were just such as you have suggested: that I had no
right to be proud to my own father, and that I
should be wicked to stand in my children’s light.
You asked me then if there were other reasons why
I should show no pride in that quarter, I answer
that there are. We must understand one another, at
least partially, my dearest Arthur, even if that partial
understanding aids in our separation. I know that it
is to your good offices that I owe this recognition of
my children. Utter the question which I see hanging
on your lips.”</p>

<p>” I’ll utter it, Algy, though all the powers of the
Inferno shall never make me believe in you as anything
but the best man who ever walked. Here it is.
Did you, before Tom or I remember, ever—well—
make a fiasco?”</p>

<p>“Never! To you I will say the simple truth.
Though I’m not strong in brain, and have that want
of energy which comes from habitual ill-health, yet I
have lived as blameless a life as any of us poor sinners
can hope to lead.”</p>

<p>“Then what has caused this terrible injustice of
my father towards you?”</p>

<p>“He has not been unjust. He has been most
generous. Question on, and let us have it
out.”</p>

<p>“Has his extraordinary treatment of you arisen
from any facts in connexion with your mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I will now finish this conversation, and
we will never resume it. I was put in possession
of certain facts when I was seventeen. Now ask
yourself, but never ask me, what has made me
grey at six-and-thirty, and has produced in my father
that never-ending thought about self, and distrust
of others, which has made him very little better
than a lunatic.”</p>

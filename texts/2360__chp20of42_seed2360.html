<!-- CHAPTER VI<br>AFTER THE PARTY. -->

<p>Mr. Carlyle went into the library when the ladies disappeared; he had one or two papers he wished to look at before retiring. It was still early, he was accustomed to late hours, and tonight, being in a particularly satisfied frame of mind, was not at all inclined for sleep.</p>

<p>He sat there for about an hour, busily employed, when there was alow knock at the door, and upon his saying ” Come in !” there entered Mrs. Sykes, the housekeeper. She made a low curtsey, and said:</p>

<p>“You are surprised to see me, sir, and I never before came with such a heavy heart to speak to you.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mrs. Sykes, what is the matter? Isn’t the venison all right?</p>

<p>“It’s quite different from that, sir. I’ve lived here for forty years; you were a mere child when I first came; and proud enough your mother was of you. Since then I’ve seen much happen to the family, both good and ill—but I never knew anything like what’s going on now under your very eyes, and you know nothing about it, if all is true that I hear, sir; and I can’t hold my tongue no longer, though you may think I’m interfering where I’ve no business.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” said Mr. Carlyle; “which of the servants is plaguing you now?”</p>

<p>“It’s none of the servants, sir.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t help you until you tell me what it is,” replied her master, not in the least alarmed by her manner.</p>

<p>“No, sir; but I hardly know how to begin.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Sykes—don’t make troubles of nothing. If you’ve anything to tell me, do so; if not——”</p>

<p>“I didn’t come here to go away without telling you,” said Mrs. Sykes, interrupting her master, who, she feared, was going to send her out of the room; “and as there’s no one else to do it, I must. They say, sir, that Miss Castleton is an old friend of Mr. Wymerly, and has been meeting him ever so many times, out in the Park here.”</p>

<p>“And you listen to such stuff, Mrs. Sykes?” said Mr. Carlyle sternly.</p>

<p>“I should have been only too glad not to listen to it, sir,” said Mrs. Sykes with quiet dignity. “The first time it was said, I told the servants to hold their tongues, and mind their own business; but I’ve heard so much about it since, I couldn’t refuse to listen. The stable-boy, Will, told the coachman he saw them with his own eyes; the coachman repeated it in the servants’ hall, and now it’s the common talk downstairs. You believe Miss Castleton has gone to bed, sir, but Jane Cleaver has just been in to tell me that it’s no such thing, and that she has been sent out of the room because my lady, and her mistress, are quarrelling so. Now, sir—that’s not the sort of thing for a young servant to spread over the house.”</p>

<p>“There must be some mistake in all this, Mrs. Sykes,” said Mr. Carlyle with great self-possession. “I’ve heard enough. Be so good as to take my compliments to Miss Castleton, and request her to come down here to me. Without her mother,” he added, laying a strong emphasis on the last three words.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sykes, satisfied that her master was really roused, and would look into the matter, left the room without another word.</p>

<p>When Marion and her mother had reached the head of the stairs, they bid each other goodnight and went to their respective rooms, Lady Castleton saying, with some anxiety:</p>

<p>“You look very tired, dear Marion, but I hope you have enjoyed it.”</p>

<p>“An odd sort of enjoyment, mamma,” was the unwelcome reply.</p>

<p>“Well, well, dear; let’s hope the enjoyment is to come,” said Lady Castleton, attempting to kiss her again; but Marion turned abruptly away and went off to her room.</p>

<p>Arrived there, she shut the door, and, throwing herself down on the sofa, buried her face in her hands and groaned aloud.</p>

<p>Whichever way she turned her thoughts, everything was dark. It was too late now to do anything, and if it were not, Mr. Wymerly was irrecoverably lost.</p>

<p>“How utterly he despises me he has shown only too plainly to-night; and how could it be otherwise? I am the meanest creature alive; there is no excuse for me; it is all my own doing. And what a life before me! And I am so young, never from this moment until I die to have one moment’s happiness—to be tied to this dull, formal old man! Oh, I hate him! I hate him! How can I bear it! I can’t, but oh! how can I help myself? Oh! Lawrence; if you only knew what I am suffering, you would forgive me ; you would carry me off where we might be together, and happy!”</p>

<p>And then her despair made her work herself into a state of anger with Mr. Wymerly. Why had he given her up so easily? If he had really cared for her he might have known it was all her mother’s doing. What could a girl do when her mother opposed her, unless her lover helped her? And instead, he had gone away just when he ought to have stayed. It was cruel—too cruel!</p>

<p>She rose from her seat and walked backwards and forwards in the room: movement seemed to give her some relief. Her maid came to undress her, but was dismissed. Marion said she wanted no help. As the girl left the room Lady Castleton entered it; she also had been considering the present position with no little uneasiness, and came to the conclusion that she had better give Marion a little advice. Few mothers understand how often they defeat their own ends through a little advice—and Lady Oastleton least of all.</p>

<p>As she entered, Marion’s back was towards the door, she did not hear her come in, and it was with a little scream of terror she turned round when her mother began to speak.</p>

<p>“I am sorry I frightened you, Marion, but I had a few words I wanted to say to you, so I hope you’ll listen.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Marion sullenly, still standing.</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down, dear? we can speak more comfortably so.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, mamma, I want to go to bed.”</p>

<p>“I will not keep you a minute, dear, but really I do think you might look a little less miserable than you do. All this evening I have been in terror, lest Mr. Carlyle should ask me what was the matter with you.”</p>

<p>“I only wish he had, and what would you have said?”</p>

<p>“That I did not know, Marion. When girls have nothing to complain of, and have a brilliant future before them, it does appear in very bad taste to go about looking as if they had no prospect at all. If Lucy Carlyle were to look dull, I should think it natural enough, poor child; but she, on the contrary, always looks the picture of health and content. I wish you would take a lesson from her, dear.”</p>

<p>“Then I will tell you, mamma,” said Marion, with a shrillness in her tone which made her mother shiver. “It is because you are forcing me to marry a man I hate, whilst you know I ought to marry another, whom I love entirely.”</p>

<p>“My dear Marion, I think you might modulate the sound of your voice a little more, when you say such remarkable things as you have just done. The whole house will hear you,” and Lady Castleton opened the room door to see if there was any one near, and perceiving Jane Cleaver, she said, “You need not wait, your mistress will not want you tonight.”</p>

<p>So Jane, who had been listening with all her might, attracted in the first instance by the little scream Marion had given on her mother’s entrance, was obliged to go off, without, however, having heard much, except that there was quarrelling going on.</p>

<p>“I do not care who hears me,” said Marion, when her mother returned; “I only wish Mr. Carlyle would, and then, at least, he would know how his kindness is appreciated.”</p>

<p>“My dear Marion, you are over tired, let me give you a sedative,” said Lady Castleton, now really alarmed.</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma, and will that give me back my peace of mind ?—will it give me back my freedom?</p>

<p>“It will enable you to sleep, and to-morrow you will see things more rationally.”</p>

<p>Lady Castleton left the room to find an anodyne for Marion, but it was not where she expected; it was some time before she found it and could return to her daughter’s room. Marion meanwhile was working herself up every minute into an increased condition of misery and excitement. Lady Castleton had but just re-entered the room, when Mrs. Sykes came to the door, and delivered her message with no little satisfaction. There was no love lost between her and either of the two ladies.</p>

<p>On hearing it, Marion started up at once, and with a half-uttered “Thank God!” she rushed out of the room and down the stairs to the library. Her mother first tried to stop her, and then to follow, but Mrs. Sykes repeated, with so much meaning, that her master particularly desired to see the young lady alone, that she was obliged to turn off to her own room, full of apprehension.</p>

<p>When Marion opened the door, Mr. Carlyle rose, and said: “I am very sorry to ask you to come down at this time, but it is better for both of us that you should personally enable me to contradict a foolish piece of gossip I have just heard. I have no doubt whatever that you will be as shocked at it as anybody; but when such things are said, it is necessary to trace them, and put a stop to them at once.”</p>

<p>Whilst saying this, Mr. Carlyle had placed a chair for Marion; but she only leant her arms on the back of it, and continued standing.</p>

<p>“I believe I am right,” continued Mr. Carlyle, “that you were unacquainted with Mr. Wymerly until you heard of him in connexion with the election, and that you were introduced to him to-night for the first time?”</p>

<p>Marion made no reply.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlyle looked surprised, but continued:</p>

<p>“I have been told that you not only knew him before, but that whilst staying here as my engaged wife, you have met him in the Park.”</p>

<p>“It is perfectly true,” said Marion, in a husky voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlyle, who had reseated himself, here rose, and said with some excitement:</p>

<p>“True, Miss Castleton! Do I hear you rightly?”</p>

<p>Marion half came round the chair, and slipped on to it to prevent herself from falling, while she said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Carlyle, I have treated you shamefully. What I have done has no excuse whatever. I deserve whatever you may think of me. You have been deceived from first to last. I have longed, as no one ever longed before, to tell you the plain truth; but I had not the courage, and nobody knows how thankful I am you should hear it now.”</p>

<p>It was Mr. Carlyle’s turn to be silent now; it would be impossible to exaggerate his surprise and dismay. After a minute Marion continued:</p>

<p>“Though I do not tell it you as the least excuse, it is right you should know that more than a year ago, Mr. Wymerly and I met abroad; we became mutually attached, and were engaged to be married, when my mother, thinking we should not have enough to live on, insisted upon breaking off the engagement.</p>

<p>“Damn the mother,” muttered Mr. Carlyle.</p>

<p>“Since then I had not seen him, until one day I met him in the Park here; we spoke, and I discovered that I had never received various letters which he had written to me. If I had received them nothing would have made me engage myself to any one else. I then promised him to tell you how matters had been between ua, and to throw myself upon your compassion; but my courage failed me. I did not do so; for this I suffer my present humiliation. I know you cannot forgive me; I do not expect it.”</p>

<p>Her confession once begun, the relief was so intense to Marion that she neither stopped nor hesitated, and was only too glad to take the whole disgrace upon herself. It was far better than the intolerable burden of the past concealment.</p>

<p>To such a man as Mr. Carlyle—one who had always lived in prosperity, whose course of life had been so smooth that he had had no experience of the deeper sufferings of life, who had always held his head erect as he passed his fellow-creatures, and to whom those fellow-creatures had always doffed the hat, or dropped the curtsey, as was the fashion in rural districts to the great man of the place—Marion’s confession came as an almost incomprehensible blow. That a young girl, whom, although he was going to make her his wife, he looked upon almost as his daughter, should have been sufficiently worldly wise to behave as she had done, shocked him beyond measure. Mr. Carlyle, though neither clever, nor professing any morality beyond what is usual amongst gentlemen, a kind of easy-going virtue, which accommodates itself to the social position of those towards whom it is exercised, would have been quite incapable of treating a lady as Marion had treated him. He would not have felt the temptation that had induced Lady Castleton to act as she had done; nor would his imagination enable him to make any excuses for such a dereliction of the plain code of honour in such matters.</p>

<p>After Marion ceased speaking, Mr. Carlyle sat turning the astounding information he had just received over and over in his own mind, quite unable to make it out, and quite unconscious how long he had continued doing so, until a slight movement of Marion’s recalled him to her presence; and he turned towards her a look of such bewildered surprise, that guilty as she felt before, her distress now was redoubled, and she half moved towards him; when perceiving her intention, he waved her away with his hand, and forced her to stop short.</p>

<p>He then said, “Am I to understand, Miss Castleton, that you were intending to become Mrs. Carlyle, without the slightest personal regard for me?”</p>

<p>There was dead silence.</p>

<p>“That you were willing to take my gifts, and even to wear my jewels, whilst wishing to be the wife of another man?”</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“That you have done me the honour of making me an old fool in the eyes of my neighbours and friends, and would even have been good enough to avoid this by going through with the farce, had not your imprudence betrayed you to a stable boy, to whom I am indebted for my release.”</p>
    
<p>Marion started at this remark. It was a humiliation for which she was not prepared.</p>

<p>“I do not understand you, sir?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, but fortunately for myself I do. I did hope you would have been able to afford me some explanation of conduct which I will not characterise, but your silence is more truthful than your words might have been. For that I am indebted to you. I will not detain you any longer. Be so good as to inform your mother that my carriage will be at her disposal at the earliest convenience for both of you to leave here to-morrow morning. When you are Mr. Wymerly’s wife it will be a pleasant subject for conversation: the folly of the old man, and how well you got out of it.”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Carlyle rose, walked to the door, and opened it for Marion to pass out, which she did with feelings in which all sense of relief was overpowered by shame and remorse. She had expected that Mr. Carlyle would have been very angry with her; she almost feared he would have insisted upon her keeping to her engagement. She forgot that he was no longer a young man. She was quite unprepared to be treated with common sense, and to have her conduct placed before her in its true colours; and she left the room without any hope for the future, with the sole conviction that everything was at an end both with regard to Mr. Carlyle and Mr. Wymerly.</p>

<p>When the door was closed and Mr. Carlyle found himself alone again, he sat down in his chair, and endeavoured to continue the occupation which Mrs. Sykes had interrupted; but the attempt was vain, wounded vanity and self love tyrannised over his thoughts, mixed with no small quantity of disappointed affection.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlyle had never had any grand “<em>affaire du cceur</em>,” in his younger days. In Marion he had seen a fair young thing to cheer the declining years of life, when the animal spirits are less elastic, and life seems dull, looked at with sober eyes. She had been staying many weeks at Powdridge Court, he had come to look for her presence as a matter of course; and hurt as he was at her conduct, it was with a feeling of real sadness that he thought of himself left alone again, without any young life about him.</p>

<p>He threw himself back in his chair, while his eyes grew moist as he contemplated his shattered hopes. If Marion could have seen him then, she would have felt as she had not yet done, that it was not only with her own happiness that she had been playing. Absorbed with her own position, she had hardly thought at all about Mr. Carlyle, excepting as he stood in the way of Mr. Wymerly. She had never thought that he too might have feelings like other people; and even now her sense of shame was far more for her own deceitfulness and want of courage in avoiding being placed in a position that ought to be impossible to any one with right womanly feeling, than for any injury she might have done to Mr. Carlyle’s affections.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for Mr. Carlyle that it was not his habit to pity himself; his life had been too prosperous, his position too assured for that, and it was not long before his present mood, which he would have designated as sentimental weakness, gave way to a far different one, and one which permitted no return of softness and regret. He became very angry, very indignant that any one should have dared to treat him as Marion and her mother had done; and whilst this frame of mind was at its height; he rang the bell violently.</p>

<p>When the footman answered it, he desired that Mrs. Sykes should come to him immediately; and the man in delivering the order also reported that master seemed in a devil of a rage.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Sykes entered, Mr. Carlyle took ten guineas from his writing-table, and giving them to her, said, “Mrs. Sykes, you have done me a great service. I will thank you to receive back from Miss Castletonthe family jewels ; and to replace them where they are kept. Here is the key. Also, you will see that the two ladies leave this house to-morrow morning before twelve o’clock. I shall breakfast in this room; and I look to you to take care that I am not in any way troubled by their presence. I shall not see either of them again. These are my orders. I shall be obliged to you to see that they are strictly carried out.”</p>

<p>“I will do so, sir,” was all Mrs. Sykes replied. She knew her master too well to add anything more, and curtseying, left the room.</p>

<p>It was two long hours before Mr. Carlyle went to his own room. It was broad daylight before any sleep came to his relief.</p>

<p>When the door of the library was closed upon Marion, she crossed the hall very slowly, the influence of Mr. Carlyle still upon her; but arrived at the foot of the stairs, her heart gave a great leap of joy, and she rushed up them with an impetus that almost knocked her mother down, who was waiting for her return at the top of them.</p>

<p>“Well, Marion?”</p>

<p>“Indeed; it is well. I’m free, I’m free!” was Marion’s alarming exclamation, as her mother, taking hold of her arm, dragged her into her bedroom. Arrived there, and the door closed, Marion threw her arms round Lady Castelton’s neck and kissing her, exclaimed again, “Oh, mother, dear, I’m free, I’m free!”</p>

<p>Instead of returning her caress, Lady Castleton pushed her away, and said, “What do you mean, child?”</p>

<p>“Just what I say. Oh the joy!” answered Marion, walking rapidly backwards and forwards across the room.</p>

<p>“Marion, you try me too much. How can you be free?”</p>

“We’re to leave to-morrow morning, mother dear. All this hateful mockery is at an end. I’ve told Mr. Carlyle the truth, and now I can be myself again.”

<p>“Told him the truth! Leave to-morrow morning!” exclaimed Lady Castleton, aghast.</p>

<p>“Don’t vex yourself about it,” exclaimed Marion, somewhat startled by the expression of her mother’s face; “I could not marry that man, anything was better than that, and now it is quite impossible.”</p>

<p>“Marion,” said Lady Castleton, “you don’t know what you’ve done. I will tell you, and then, ungrateful girl, you can rejoice at the position in which you’ve placed me. I have done everything for you, and this is what you have done for me.” And Lady Castleton, taking up her purse, which was lying upon the table, opened it, placing upon the cloth the whole of its contents. Three sovereigns lay there, and a couple of shillings.</p>

<p>“Look, child; that is all the money I have in the world, or shall have for another two months, and I leave you to guess whether we can live upon that for the next two months. It is impossible for us to leave here to-morrow, quite impossible.”</p>

<p>“But, mamma, how can this be? We have always had enough to live upon till now.”</p>

<p>“How can it be? Because a thoughtless ungrateful child, who only thinks of her own happiness, and that she is much wiser than her mother, who has to provide the means for her subsistence, has reduced her poor old mother to this pass.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, mamma, how can you say such things?”</p>

<p>“Because it is true, Marion. You were engaged in a perfectly unexceptional manner; your future and mine were well assured. Few girls have such opportunities as you had. With your prospects, in order to do you honour, I did not hesitate to spend my income in procuring both for you and myself a wardrobe suited to those prospects. Mr. Carlyle, with that generosity which I have found in all my transactions with him, never let me have any expenses, and as I was to continue his guest until the wedding, and afterwards for as long as I pleased, I have spent every farthing I possessed, excepting what you now see before you, on your trousseau, and on the necessary dresses for myself. So now you can understand in what a position your conduct has placed us both.”</p>

<p>Almost a sensation of fear crept over Marion as her mother said this. It was the first time that she had been brought face to face with actual want of money. Even now, she did not know what it meant, but she saw there was a real difficulty; so she said, “I’m very sorry, mamma, but you would not have me sell myself.”</p>

<p>“I would not have you talk such nonsense, nor use such unladylike expressions. You may think it very fine to say you cannot sell yourself, but let me tell you, you have never had a chance. When people buy it is something that has value; you are simply worth nothing; no one will bid for you.”</p>

<p>After a pause, Lady Castleton resumed, “Mr. Carlyle has made you. many presents; where are they?”</p>

<p>“I will collect them, and leave them with the housekeeper, to return to him.”</p>

<p>“You had better do so; put them upon the table in your room, I will hand them to Mrs. Sykes; and now leave me.”</p>

<p>Marion spent the next two hours in preparing to leave. At last, thoroughly wearied out, she went to bed, and fell into so deep a sleep that she was quite unconscious that her mother came into her room during it.</p>

<p>Lady Castleton was dreadfully puzzled what to do. She was intensely mortified by the failure of her schemes just when they were on the eve of accomplishment. She had not given Marion credit for the inconvenient truthfulness she had just displayed. She felt it was no use planning for a daughter who could upset the wisest arrangements for a sentimental grievance. She had been accustomed to manage Marion. For the first time she realised that her little girl was an independent human being with a will of her own, who might one day also be her mother’s judge. Lady Castleton sat on a long while, pondering what her next step should be. She had no very near relations; the nearest was an uncle, a Mr. Stapleton, her own mother’s only brother. Though many years younger than her mother, he was now an old man. Some years before this he had married a young wife, by whom he had several daughters and one son. The thought of this son suddenly raised Lady Castleton’s drooping spirits. He could not be much younger than Marion. She would throw herself upon her uncle’s compassion. She had been shamefully treated by Mr. Carlyle. Both Marion and herself were victims.</p>

<p>If nothing came of it, at any rate it would give breathing time for future consideration. Lady Castleton determined, if possible, not to leave Powdridge Court the next day, but if she had to do so it might have its advantages; though it would not give her time for writing to her uncle, it would add to her claim upon his hospitality, that she was actually turned out of the house. Lady Castleton knew nothing of Mrs. Stapleton, and feeling it would be best to be provided against all possible contingencies, she went into her daughter’s room. There upon the table lay the various handsome presents Marion from time to time had received from Mr. Carlyle. Surveying them with greedy eyes, she finally selected a diamond bracelet and an Indian shawl. If necessary, she could raise a handsome sum upon them; if unnecessary, they could be returned at some future time. Lady Castleton carried them off into her own room, and, returning to her daughter’s, she re-arranged the table, throwing a cover over it, and trusting to the bustle of the morning preventing any one’s perceiving there were things missing. The only person she really feared was Marion; it was not at all likely that Mrs. Sykes should know all that had been given.</p>

<p>It was five o’clock before Lady Castleton lay down in her bed, which she did more for the sake of appearance than from any expectation of rest; her mind continued far too busy, no sleep came near her, so that it was a positive relief when the maid brought hot water in the morning, and put an end to the farce of repose.</p>

<p>Jane Cleaver waited upon both Lady Castleton and Marion, and she now brought a message from Mrs. Sykes, “requesting to know at what hour her ladyship would like to have the carriage?”</p>

<p>This question made Lady Castleton shiver. It told her that the whole household knew she was to go, but she answered it by saying she should be glad to speak to Mrs. Sykes, if she would be good enough to come to her now.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sykes soon made her appearance. A single glance at her countenance told Lady Castleton there was nothing to be gained in that quarter, but she received her very graciously, and said, “That she had not meant to have left for a day or two longer; she did not know if there would be any difficulty in her remaining on. Could the matter rest until she had spoken to Mr. Carlyle?”</p>

<p>“My master is not yet up, he is never called, and no one goes near him until he makes his appearance; when that may be is quite uncertain?”</p>

<p>“I would not have him disturbed on any account,” said Lady Castleton; “but perhaps I could remain, and settle afterwards about the carriage. I am sure he would be glad to accommodate me.”</p>

<p>“I had my orders last night, my lady. It is my business to carry them out; I never disobey my master.”</p>

<p>“Of course not; but I thought there might be some misunderstanding. The last time I saw Mr. Carlyle, I knew it was settled we should leave the day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I do not think there is any mistake,” replied Mrs. Sykes, in a most determined manner. “Shall I order the carriage at eleven o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Thank you; that will do nicely,” replied Lady Castleton, checkmated.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sykes was withdrawing when Lady Castleton called her back, and said:</p>

<p>“Upon the table in my daughter’s room, you will find some things which she wishes to be given to Mr. Carlyle, after our departure. Be so kind as to remove them while we are at breakfast, that there may be no confusion afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Very well, my lady,” was Mrs. Sykes’s reply, adding to herself when the door was closed: “I will take precious good care they are under lock and key before you leave, madam.”</p>

<p>At half-past eleven, Mr. Carlyle’s carriage drove through the gates of the park, conveying Lady Castleton and Marion to the railway station. Their luggage was to follow them, and to be left at the principal inn in the village near Mr. Stapleton’s residence.</p>

<title>Chapter 4 of THE SECOND YOUTH OF THEODORA DESANGES by ELIZABETH LINTON</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- CHAPTER IV -->
<p>
Few contingencies of human life were hidden from the wide experience of my three-score years and upward. The second sight of knowledge shewed me the shadow of the thing to come. I knew it all. Each hideous detail was plain before me, and I was powerless to avert the catastrophe that I knew was at hand. Sooner or later, it must be!
</p>
<p>
For the moment, however, I would do what I could; so I wired to Sir James a simple message: “Look after your son” — which I did not sign.
</p>
<p>
Then I sat still and waited on events, while the day passed and the night came on.
</p>
<p>
In these terrible hours I seemed to see deep into the truth, — is it the true truth, with nothing better beyond ? — of how the whole earth is wet with the tears and blood, while the air re-echoes with the cries and sobs, of suffering humanity; and how illusory are the joys which, when we are young and vigorous, distract our minds from the grief and terror which lies beneath the specious surface.
</p>
<p>
Of the bones of men is made the dust on which we tread; from the death of thousands comes the life which is our own. Wherever I looked was death, and the eternal scythe was never still. One more or less, what did it count in the illimitable sum? If his enemy or nature be the murderer, where to lay the blame? It is the law, and must be fulfilled by all alike. To-morrow, if not to-day — a week hence, if not now — and how short the respite even from youth to old age! Like a dream in the night passes the longest life; like a shadow over the river it hastens from its coming to its going. How few hours from the morning to the night! and how swiftly they run! So long to look forward to in one’s early youth, by memory, looking back, they are crumpled up into a few breaths — a few tears — some lost delights — some baffled hopes — some frustrated endeavours. And the end has to come! What matter when? When it comes, have we not then reached the great gate of peace — that Gate Beautiful which leads to the Garden of Eternal Rest?
</p>
<p>
A sharp ring at the door pealed through the house, and a letter was brought to me — sent by hand. It was addressed in Bertie’s handwriting and dated from his club; and it was a farewell to me for ever. He could not live, he said; and he would not. The shame and horror of it all were too much for him. On the one side was this newborn love for me as I was now — a love that could not accept denial and that as little could ask for a return; on the other was his memory of the past, which made the present like some hideous dream, some fiendish mockery. Between the two he had no choice but to die. He could not live without me, and he dared not think of me, still less ask me to be his. The past stood as an eternal barrier, but the present overpowered the past, though it could not ignore it. Wherefore — an everlasting farewell! It was all that was left him if he would preserve his self-respect or sanity itself. And then, with many wild words of fond endearment and passionate regrets, he ended — that revolver on the table — in his hand — so soon as he should have sent this letter!
</p>
<p>
It was the natural end of the fatal coil; and again I was neither surprised nor appalled. I simply went deeper into the darkness where yet I made out more clearly the true form of the reality of things. It was all merely part of the tragedy of life — life which means suffering, after the first vivid joys of youth and novelty have passed into the known and accustomed. I was grieved for the sorrow of his parents and for all that the boy himself had borne of anguish, shame, and the futile tortures of an impossible passion. Grieved — is there no stronger word? —  but I had no sense of guilt or conscious responsibility. I had done nothing to turn that sweet childish love for the kind old Granny of the past into the violent passion of a boy for a girl. What I had been I was still; and for the mischief wrought by this superimposed beauty — which was not my own — I was not accountable.
</p>
<p>
Yet I had to bear the blame of this, too: and the mother’s natural despair for the loss of her son — her darling and her hope — was accentuated by her horror of me, the cause.
</p>
<p>
What she wrote to me I cannot repeat. One does not care to chronicle the frantic curses of a bereaved mother; and I had no alternative but to let them pass as I would have let pass the cries of some wounded animal — as the savage onslaught of some creature from whom its young has been taken and who assailed the first person met with in its path.
</p>
<p>
She held me responsible as the conscious and intentional agent of all that had come upon her, as the wilful setter of the stage whereon this tragedy had been enacted. From the first she had resented the miracle of my rejuvenescence, but now she added to her hatred of the physical change, for which I was in nowise accountable, a hatred of me morally, which was so intense as to be scarcely sane. She could not and would not see that the whole thing was a tragedy in which I was an unwilling agent — that, if I were Cain, I was a sinless Cain, and the blood of that poor slain Abel was not on my head! She made me responsible from first to last and cursed me as Sisera’s mother might have cursed Jael.
</p>
<p>
But Sir James privately wrote me a little note which, while he too bade me farewell for ever — for, indeed, all the ties which had bound us for so many years in such strict friendship were now broken and cast to the winds — exonerated me from blame. “<em>Il dono fatale di bellezza</em>” he said, added to the familiar love of a life on another plane, was the sole cause of all that had been. I was certainly the cause, but the innocent cause; and he, for one, acquitted me. He still retained the love he had felt for me for so many years, but, as he put it to me, in the strange sad circumstances in which we stood, was not total severance the best that could be done?
</p>
<p>
Thus, then, ended my intercourse with the Ardours, which had lasted now for over five-and-twenty years in the closest relations possible between friends and unrelated blood. If by rare chance I met them in the open, Esther and Ellen “cut” me without even the pretence of not seeing me; but Sir James would look over to me with a certain sadness — a certain sweet and tender expression which had in it compassion, sorrow, forgiveness — and something else. And, whatever I might be doing, my daughter of former years made her disdain and reproaches visible. If I were walking she made me feel I was coarsely robust and unimpaired by remorse; if driving, I was vainglorious and ostentatious; if riding, I was lost to all sense of decency or fitness.
</p>
<p>
I seemed to have a double kind of faculty — the power to read thoughts as well as to interpret faces — and I could read Esther’s heart as though it were an open book. Poor sorely troubled daughter of my old age! Had she but forgiven me, and taken me to her heart again as I was, not minding what I seemed to be, she would have saved herself some pain and me infinite distress!
</p>
<p>
The last time I saw them I was painfully struck with the change in them all. I was walking towards the Park; they were coming from it, and we met face to face —without a chance of turning on either side. I stopped dead as I saw them, and with all the old impulsive love held out both my hands. I forgot the bitter “in between” and remembered only the former sweetness.
</p>
<p>
“Dear, dear Ess!” I said; “oh, speak to me, darling!”
</p>
<p>
She looked at me with unfeigned horror.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t touch me, murderess!” she said, and passed me by as swift as an arrow from the bow.
</p>
<p>
Oh what a change it all was! Sir James was grey, bent, withered — looking like a man of seventy rather than the age he was; and Esther’s beauty had gone together with her former trim care for her personal appearance. Both were buried with her happiness in poor Bertie’s terrible grave, and “the handsome Lady Ardour” as she used to be called, had now no more grace or beauty, no more dignity or charm than any fifth-rate provincial in a fifth-rate provincial town.
</p>
<p>
Ellen looked the embodiment of girlish misery — that mixture of unhappiness and discontent which would spoil the most lovely face in the world, and rob the most youthful of its freshness. It was plain that sorrow had soured her, while it had crushed her parents, breaking down Sir James into premature old age, and sweeping out of Esther all the sweeter charms of womanhood.
</p>
<p>
Not long after this I heard of dear James Ardour’s illness. He was struck down with paralysis, and, after a few days of miserable semi-consciousness, he died. Then Lady Ardour and her daughter left London for Rome, where Ellen fell a victim to that ever-present danger, typhoid fever; and then my poor Esther was left alone. Ah! how bitterly I lamented her estrangement from me! How gladly I would have comforted her, had she but let me! But this chapter in my book of life was closed for ever; and the first-fruits of my rejuvenescence were sorrow, despair, and death; eternal separation from the family I had loved best in the world; and a loneliness of soul to match my poor girl’s desolation of heart and life.
</p>
<p>
I was powerless to change my dear lost daughter’s decree. I did what I could, and some will say more than I ought, for even love must not overcome self-respect, and the peace of reconciliation may be bought at too heavy a price. Still, I put all this aside. I humbled myself before her, and besought her to forgive what was no more a voluntary thing on my part than if I had been an automaton or if it had been a dream that the poor boy had dreamt. I forgot the curse she had hurled at me, the reproaches she had heaped on me. I forgot, too, our old relations and wrote to her as a suppliant — a subordinate, if you like to call it so.
</p>
<p>
It was all in vain! To my first letter she returned no answer; my second she sent back unopened. The death, which had laid the others beneath the earth in those graves which would never be reopened — that death was not more complete with them than the moral death there was between her and me. Not only as my daughter but even as my friend — as my mere acquaintance — she had passed out of my life, and there was no one to replace her and hers.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most lonely creature standing between earth and sky was I, this same Theodora Desanges, whom crowds flocked to see — whose name was on every tongue — whose love men almost daily sought to win — and whose main endeavour was to keep some hours of the day uninvaded — some part of life sacred. It was all like giving husks for meal and a painted stone for bread. There was no reality in it. Too old in mind and experience for the young — too young in bodily strength and vigour for the old, I had no natural associates. The follies of youth, born of ignorance and thoughtlessness, which yet are so graceful and natural to youth, would have been as impossible to me now as when I looked the age I really was. But the gravity and the disillusionment belonging to one now past seventy and able to appraise life at its true value — these sat so ill on one of my apparent youth as to make me look insincere and ridiculous.
</p>
<p>
I was a mere flying-fish — chased in the air by the birds, pursued in the sea by the fishes, and safe in neither element. My former women friends deserted me; for, like Esther and Ellen, the pretty young creatures who had been in the ranks of the daughters or granddaughters of my generation, would have none of me rejuvenated, and only the more undesirable of my former slight acquaintances clung to my skirts, whereby they might be swept into a higher social sphere than that to which they naturally belonged.
</p>
<p>
Of these, indeed, I had enough and to spare, and my trouble was how to escape from their importunities; but of the former intimates of the second degree, though by no means so close as the Ardours had been, I had only three who treated me with common sense, neither affecting to consider me as a Girl of the Period — which phrase had just then taken the town — nor perpetually reminding me that I was a septuagenarian, and more, and therefore out of the run of things as things were. These three were Lady Jane, Alice Laing, and little Mrs. Listerton — with all of whom I had been on the plane of motherhood when I was old — or rather, with May Listerton I had been as the grandmother.
</p>
<p>
As for the men, young and middle-aged, for the most part they fell in love with me, and wondered at my irresponsiveness — each man thinking himself the most suitable. One and all revolted me — heaven only knows how much!
</p>
<p>
This was the transition time of manners. Remember, I was born and brought up and received my impress under the <em>régime</em> of politeness, before this had been changed for familiarity. I had called my father “sir” or “my lord” at the stateliest moments — he had been a bishop — and, even when a married man and a beneficed clergyman, my brother would not have dared to ask for a glass of wine at the table. No gentleman then smoked in the presence of ladies, and the etiquette of the ballroom was rigidly preserved. I shall never forget the first time I saw a young man lounge up to me with his hand in his pocket to claim me for a dance, nor when I heard Gwynn Carroll, an artist famous for his flesh tints and audacity, call to his hostess from the other side of the room: “Arethusa, come here!”
</p>
<p>
That episode of the hand and the pocket finished my desire of dancing, and Gwynn Carroll’s familiarity to Mrs. — , completed my disgust with the modern manner. Still, things were not so bad thirty years ago as they are now; but they were “on the down grade,” and I did not like them. It was not a pleasant experience to me, after the habit of respect due to my age, to be treated with an informality that had in it both familiarity and that kind of admiration which may be pleasant to very young girls, but which to me was, in some sense, an insult. But I could never impress upon certain of the “bucks” of that day — the fathers of the later Johnnies and Chappies — that I disliked their ways and loathed their flattery. The dignity of the stately past sat so ill on the freshness of the abounding present. The more irrepressible frankly laughed in my face; the less genial scowled, and the cynical sneered. And between them all fashionable society became simply hateful to me, and I determined to have no more of it.
</p>
<p>
It was the end of the season when I made this resolve. Gwynn Carroll, who always cited me as “the most beautiful bit of living mechanism” he knew, though he did not make love to me, as the phrase goes, protested against my resolve, as an offence against the claims of art, which he held to be paramount over all other considerations. He used to carry these claims so far, indeed, as to maintain the duty of all Beauty to lend itself to Art, no matter what was required, nor of what social rank the possessor.
</p>
<p>
“Beauty,” he used to say, “was a gift for the world at large to profit by. Like a fine voice or any other artistic talent it was not for an individual but for the community; and to withdraw the contemplation of it from that community was a theft and a grievous sin.
</p>
<p>
May Listerton had told him what I had said to Alice Laing one day, when I had been more than ever revolted by the change in manners, which so deeply offended my sense of what was befitting and well bred; and he caught at the end of the season as the first point of attack. His second was on his own especial ground.
</p>
<p>
“You say you will give up society, Mrs. Desanges?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes indeed!” I answered. “I do not care for it.”
</p>
<p>
“When you have sucked the orange of the season dry, you throw away the skin?” he laughed.
</p>
<p>
“We generally do,” I said.
</p>
<p>
“Hard on the skin,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Would you have us cherish it?” I asked. “Does not everything come to an end by time — the pleasure to be found in balls and parties with the rest?”
</p>
<p>
“But beautiful women have a duty to others,” he said. “You owe yourself to the world, Mrs. Desanges; and to withdraw from society while you are able to enter into it and are its brightest ornament is both selfish and sinful.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not see the selfishness and I deny the sin,” I answered coldly.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Gnothi Seauton</em>. May not others judge better than yourself? They know where the shoe pinches.”
</p>
<p>
“What nonsense!” I said wearily.
</p>
<p>
It was an impolitic thing to say. From me such a staunch stickler for the <em>bienséances</em> it was an outrage.
</p>
<p>
Gwynn Carroll prided himself on his downrightness. Underneath all his Bohemian gaiety he was a bit of tinder which a spark would set alight and a breath fan into a flame.
</p>
<p>
“You take refuge in the true feminine fortress,” he said, tossing up his head. “It is all nonsense talking to a woman when she declines to reason — perhaps when she cannot. What we men feel and think counts for nothing with the average female mind. Drag it and you will find — what? The Narcissus-like reflection of herself and nothing else.”
</p>
<p>
“Is this railing or argument?” I asked.
</p>
<p>
“Neither. It is fact,” he answered.
</p>
<p>
“The gospel according to Mr. Gwynn Carroll,” I said with a smile.
</p>
<p>
“Smile like that,” said my artist, suddenly changing his manner; “and you may slate me at your pleasure.”
</p>
<p>
Being histrionic as well as artistic and audacious he flung himself into an attitude of devotion; and, as ill luck would have it, at that instant May Listerton was announced — of all the women I knew the one whom, as it afterwards turned out, it was most essential that I should impress with my unapproachable and impregnable dignity. And she to “catch” me like this, with a man of Gwynn Carroll’s known indifference to restraints posturising before me as though I were a woman to be wooed, not being a goddess to be adored!
</p>
<p>
It was an unpleasant moment, for I was still sensitive to ridicule — that being one of the most deeply rooted and persistent feelings we possess — the earliest to arise and the last to leave us.
</p>
<p>
“I am <em>de trop</em>?” she said sweetly; but she laughed unpleasantly.
</p>
<p>
“On the contrary,” I said coldly, “you are to the moment. You could not be more opportune.”
</p>
<p>
Gwynn Carroll had by now risen to his feet. He was no more abashed than if he had been found turning over the leaves of a book.
</p>
<p>
“I was imploring this beautiful obdurate,” he said. “I was preaching to her George Eliot’s gospel of duty, and telling her how she owed herself to the world, and to art, and to others, and how she ought not to think of herself only. That was the key to the riddle.”
</p>
<p>
“I see,” said May Listerton drily. “It was an easy riddle and a pretty key.”
</p>
<p>
“It was all a piece of apery and folly,” I said disdainfully. “I am the last person in the world to whom such fantastic absurdities are welcome.”
</p>
<p>
“And the first to whom they come,” said May demurely.
</p>
<p>
“All beautiful women are born for the good of the world at large,” said Gwynn Carroll. “They owe a duty to society. No person with a gift has the right to hide it under a bushel; and the gift ofbeauty is of all others the most divine and the most imperative.”
</p>
<p>
“But what do you wish dear Mrs. Desanges to do?” asked May.
</p>
<p>
“Not to withdraw from the world as she threatens,” was the artist’s answer. “And more — I want her to sit to me for my portrait of Boadicea. Boadicea on a rock, surveying her scattered troops, and waiting for the advent of the Roman soldiers who are clambering up from below.”
</p>
<p>
“How pretty!” said May. “What would be her costume? Something <em>very</em> lovely, Mr. Carroll?”
</p>
<p>
“Drapery and a leopard skin,” was the answer. “Floating hair — buskined feet — bracelets — chains — diaphanous drapery, showing the fine contour of the limbs beneath, and the leopard-skin over half the naked breast.”
</p>
<p>
“And Mrs. Desanges does not take to the idea?” said May, with her pretty little air of artificial demureness.
</p>
<p>
“How can you ask?” I interposed, with my most crushing manner of contempt. “Am I the person to lend myself to this kind of affectation — this very postiche representation?”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Postiche</em> — why <em>postiche</em>?” flared out Gwynn Carroll.
</p>
<p>
“Diaphanous drapery and a leopard skin for a British queen of the time of Julius Caesar! Sandalled shoes and half-clad body! And you put that forward as an historical picture, Mr. Carroll? To me it is mere childishness — on a par with the artist who tumbled a scuttleful of coals into his back garden and painted from them the rocks which hemmed in the figures of Hagar and Ishmael in the desert!”
</p>
<p>
“An artist’s imagination goes beyond the need for vulgar accuracy and meticulous detail,” said Gwynn Carroll loftily.
</p>
<p>
“Not in my code of necessity,” I said. “Truth and verisimilitude are to me as the breath of life in a picture, as in all other things.”
</p>
<p>
“Your Philistinism is deplorable, Mrs. Desanges,” said Gwynn Carroll, shrugging his shoulders. “Your soul should be so pure, so high-soaring, so untrammelled; and it is, instead, so bound to the paltry things of life — to facts rather than to ideas.”
</p>
<p>
“Just so, and I hope ever will be so,” I answered. Which curt reply ended the conversation and the interview.
</p>
<p>
At that time there was a certain school of the emancipated, who carried their liberal ideas into the very millrace of moral anarchy. Free lovers — the marriage tie had no binding power with them. Artists — art was the beginning and end of life; the one thing needful, and the one thing to be served at all costs. What in later days poor Trilby did without shame or sense of wrong, they maintained all women should be willing to do for the furtherance of an artistic idea. To such as these no woman’s modesty was sacred, because they held it as something superfluous, hindering, and low, compared with the superior merits of art. They would take the head of the simplest and most virginal girl and put it on the naked bust and body of a fancy picture, and not see that they had committed an outrage — almost a sacrilege — nor that they had exposed their unwilling model to the gravest suspicion. If the face were one that lent itself to their idea, that was all they cared for. Wherefore they were a dangerous set of people to know, and Gwynn Carroll was the most dangerous of them all.
</p>
<p>
So, too, were the <em>littérateurs</em> associated with them. They were as ‘sacrilegious with the pen as were their brothers with the brush. They would draw to the life the character and personality of those they knew and make them do and say things in their books of the most damaging quality. It was all in the way of art, and to further the life-likeness as well as the dignity of literature, they said, and no one had a right to complain. Every hint they gathered up and amplified; every confidence they betrayed into “copy.” They were drawing-room spies and eavesdroppers, and there was no social stronghold into which they could not penetrate. Any one who knows the literature of the middle part of this century knows how the sentiment of personal portraiture — of social photography — dominates the fiction of a certain school. This coarsely lined individuality, as against the more generalised description of types — of which perhaps the most perfect example is Becky Sharp — was the precursor of the modern realistic novel. It began with persons, and has gone on to things, and between the two the more delicate suggestiveness of the idealist and the sketcher is nowhere to be found.
</p>
<p>
Allusiveness has given place to the crudest and most unveiled photography; and books which the young may read and get no harm from, because they are not understood, yet which to the experienced are as water drawn from the deepest wells of life, those books are no longer produced. Between the skim milk of sentimental superficiality and the dregs of realistic sensuality there is no mean. From “Le Pere Goriot” to “La Terre ” — from Thackeray to the Bodley Head — the gap is as wide as that from Leech to Aubrey Beardsley. And the period of which I am now writing was the period of transition in literature and art as well as in manners and dynasties.

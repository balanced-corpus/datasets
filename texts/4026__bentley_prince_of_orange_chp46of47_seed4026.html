<p>
The labours of the fleet — The flight of the Spaniards — Leyden relieved.
</p>
</div>
<p>
Boisot, the Admiral, who had been so sadly dispirited, now rallied, and buckled bravely to his work. When his galleys had a couple of feet and more of water, he made a feint on a road between Benthuisen and Zwieten; by this the enemy were deceived, while at midnight of the 1st of October, the Admiral advanced with twenty-five galleys on Soeterwoude, to the left of the Nordaa, where the Spaniards were strongly fortified. This division he led on in person, and Admiral Willemsohn, Colonel la Garde, and several renowned officers seconded him. The other wing of the fleet which had stretched out towards Zwieten, was in charge of the Vice-Admiral; and Philip van Assellier, the ordnance master, remained on the Nordaa, with a hundred store-ships, and the heavy gun-boats, guarded by ten galleys, until the passage should have been opened by the main body. 
</p>
<p>
Besides the Spanish trenches, there was a large dam called the church road to be occupied before the fleet could be brought up to Leyden. The Spaniards had occupied this with pickets in boats. Boisot’s galleys moved on this dam in extended order, with a strong body of sappers in about twenty boats, in their centre. When the water was so shallow that the galleys grounded, the Zealanders jumped into the water, and shoved the lightened vessel forward. The colossus, illuminated by a brisk fire, rolling about in the stormy night, terrified the Spaniards on the dam. After losing forty men, they fell back on the detachment that had fortified themselves in an angle of the dam. This detachment gave way also, and the Spaniards came up from the other side to their assistance. But the galleys lay to and administered such doses of grape shot, putting as many as three hundred bullets into one piece, that the defenders gave away <em>en masse</em>, and the sappers were landed on the dam. They cut through it, fortified it on both sides of the cutting, and La Garde took charge of the redoubt thrown up against Soeterwoude, while Grenu and several officers occupied the other. During all this time, the fleet had been bombarding Soeterwoude, and the Leydeners soon saw the column of fire sent up by the burning houses, which had been fired by the Zealanders and the French.
</p> 
<p>
The same night the fleet passed the cutting in the Church-road in face of the enemy. Assellier’s store-ships followed — only two of them were lost by missing the channel and grounding — the Spaniards took them. Beyond the Church-road they steered for Meerbrückenpolder: they found the intermediate land very insufficiently covered with water, but the Zealanders, not to be repulsed by any emergency, sprang into the water again, and pretty nearly carried the vessels by main strength into the deeper channel. 
</p>
<p>
When day came, and the Spaniards perceived that the Zealanders, who had cut their way through near Soeterwoude, were already in the Meerbrückenpolder, and making way for the Pfaffenmeere, which lay between Lammen (an almost impregnable redoubt thrown up, as will be recollected, at the junction of the roads) and Soeterwoude, they feared they should be surrounded, and their retreat cut off. The water, an element ever detested by the Spaniards, had risen another foot during the night, and Valdez himself was one of the first to get out of its way. A pathway was still open to Vorschooten, which they endeavoured to heighten with fascines. The Spaniards took flight along that from their fortified village. A little too late, Louis de Boisot observed their precipitate retreat; but he instantly sent the galleys to pursue them, while the ships directed their fire on the narrow way. The boatmen pulled the enemy off with their long boat-hooks, drowned them in the water, or tossed them into the boats, and killed them there. The Spaniards sprang into the water, but the Zealanders deserted their boats and followed them, hewing them down with their long swords in the waves. About a couple of hundred of the enemy met their end in this miserable way. The remnant of those who had been overtaken by the galleys, threw away their arms, and waded or swam direct through the flood, and those who were not drowned, at last reached the Leyden dam, and got to Vorburg. The hot arrogance of victory was slaked by a fearful cold bath, and the Spanish artillery at Soeterwoude, even the boats with wine, and other property of General Valdez, became a prize to the Zealanders.
</p> 
<p>
The besiegers lying in Lammen and Leyderdorf on the Rhine were spectators and witnesses of this scene. They saw Soeterwoude in flames in the middle of the water, their countrymen flying, the fleet appearing in the Meerburg waters which extend from the Meerbrückenpolder on the Rhine, and, passing Leyderdorf, obliquely fall into the river. The spectacle broke down their vaunted courage. The Spanish triangular redoubt, which commanded the Rhine at Leyderdorf and the Vliet at Lammen, was a source of such anxiety to the Admiral, that he wrote to the Prince, that if the storming attack which was to be made on Lammen should prove fruitless, they must wait for deeper waters, and then sail past the fort. Even after the breaches were made, he had too few soldiers to take a position fortified with so many guns, and so well manned.
</p> 
<p>
All their good fortune, their efforts, and past success, now depended on the resolute and intrepid defence of a fort commanded by a captain of that renowned race, the Dorias. The 2nd of October was passed in preparations for assaulting the fort. The outset was unfavourable. The Spanish shot damaged the fleet seriously. One single ball killed seven Zealanders at once. A sally by the Leydeners would materially help Boisot. The city commandant was momentarily waiting instructions for the purpose. But the pigeon carrying the despatch never reached the city. These feathered postmen had long been the aim of every sharpshooter;
and the most neutrally-minded pigeon could not fly over the Spanish lines in safety. 
</p>
<p>
The Admiral would have ascribed the inactivity of the Leydeners to their surrender at last, had not the besieged cheered every fresh step made by the fleet with enthusiastic joy. When the fire was opened on Lammen, and the blazing Church of Soeterwoude announced the capture of the General’s head-quarters, the Leydeners hung out flags from their towers. The women and children who pressed up to the walls were driven away, and all able-bodied men mustered to their posts. Even the relieved guard were brought up, and the craft was removed from all the waters, canals, and ditches in Leyden, to make way for the entrance of the store-ships. The Burgomasters came on the walls, and showed to their skeleton citizens the fort Lammen, beyond which the fleet was again brought to a standstill: 
</p>
<p>
“See, my brethren, in front of that redoubt are provisions. What say you, shall we leave them there, and die of hunger?” 
</p>
<p>
“No, no,” shouted the emaciated and powerless crowd, “never; we would rather pull down the fort with our nails.” 
</p>
<p>
The Vice-Admiral, Jost de Moore, who remained at the ruins of Soeterwoude by Boisot’s orders, called his officers to a council to debate how Leyden would be best reached, if the locks of the canal could not be taken. A proposal was made and carried not unworthy of the warriors who were gaining naval victories on dry land. A thousand dykers should be set to work day and night, to cut a canal east of the fort right into the city. The distance from the last water-basin would not be more than the third of a German mile, and the ground was covered, and in many places deep under water. 
</p>
<p>
The prodigious resolve was not carried out; for while the Zealanders were gnashing their teeth with rage before Lammen, and saw themselves, after the incredible labours of a week, on the last day, and that day Sunday, brought up within a stone’s throw of their goal, the Spaniards on their side looked with equal terror on the fleet as the Netherlanders with rage on the redoubt. A boat stole off from Worschooten to Lammen. It bore orders from Waldez to the commander of the fort to retire if a superior enemy was attacking him. For in the present position of the fleet it was not possible to come to their assistance. 
</p>
<p>
The boat had arrived during the night, the message quite extinguished the last sparks of Spanish courage. With the town in front, the fleet in their rear, the river Vliet on their left, and on their right an inundated descent, whose eddies appeared far more terrible in the darkness than the Zealanders themselves, and then the news that they must not reckon on support, they were completely disheartened. While the officers stood consulting with Doria, a clap of thunder resounded from the city, and shook the very air. They must have sprung a mine. The Spaniards thought nothing less than that the besiegers were throwing down their walls by force to make a sally en masse, and to take Lammen by storm. With one eye on the fleet, the other on the city, whose attack they knew was coming, the panic-struck Spaniards threw their arms into the water, and rushed out of their fort with such blind precipitation, that many of them tumbled headlong into the holes or ditches in their way, from whence they could not extricate themselves, and were drowned.
</p> 
<p>
The terrific report which had so alarmed the enemy, was the fall of an immense mass of the town wall, six and twenty rods in length, between the Cow-gate and the Burgundy Tower, which laid the city open at once to the besiegers, had they but known it, depriving the besieged of a protection at a critical moment when they could never have made it good with living men. The fleet was anchored at about a cannonshot from the elevated fort, which was much too far off to keep guard over it during the night. But one of those, young lions in Leyden, a boy, who was standing on the town wall, remarked that a crowd of Spaniards, whom he recognised by the glimmering light of the matches, quitted the fortress without returning. He communicated his knowledge to the commandant, who had hastened with his officers to make good the rent in the wall. In consideration of a gratuity, the boy undertook to wade over to Lammen in the morning and reconnoitre the fort. If the Spanish caught him, he was only to represent himself as a starved runaway. He went, found the redoubt deserted, and waved his hat as a signal; but the citizens, fearing that a hidden enemy had compelled him to deceive them, Captain Treslong offered to go and follow the boy. To their astonishment and joy the besieged saw him pass uninjured through the mighty outwork. And while Treslong endeavoured to wade through the water to the Admiral, Captain Gerard van der Laan advanced with his company from the city, and took possession of the deserted redoubt. When the Beggars saw the Captain wading through the water, and in him recognised their old and favourite officer, such a shout of welcome was set up, as showed they had no fear of the Prince’s anger before their eyes. Sjoert Enkerken threw himself overboard from “the Margaret’s” decks instantly, though, it being Sunday, he had honoured the day and his own high rank as a Commander, by putting on his best clothes. He lifted his Captain into a boat, and while the little craft was making for the flag ship with lusty strokes of the oar, he poured in such a flood of kind questions that Treslong could not answer them, at the same time wiping the water off, not merely his clothes, but his face as well, though he had not been up to his chest in it.
</p> 
<p>
“And do all the rest look like you, Treslong Half earth — half lead And the Lady Francisca and Réné? Did you leave Leyden in the night? Did you swim the Vliet? And is not the city expecting us? A drop of beer could not hurt you, and a good biscuit and cheese would surely be something to amuse yourself with, while we are pulling for Boisot’s galley; but here we are. And see, the report has preceded us. The Admiral is on his deck waiting for you. Huzza! Hurrah for Orange and his brave Captains!” 
</p>
<p>
Treslong mounted the ship’s side, and told his news of the desertion of Lammen. 
</p>
<p>
“You speak of impossibilities, Sir Treslong,” replied the Admiral; “but, how could you be here if the Spaniards were still in Lammen?” 
</p>
<p>
The Captain did not see the look of mistrust that Boisot cast on the messenger before giving his orders. His former comrades thronged round him, and instead of one question, ten were put to him. Embraces, congratulations, offers of attention and refreshments, quite overwhelmed him. It was not till the Admiral’s speaking trumpet was heard, ordering only two galleys, and not the whole fleet, to be sent to Lammen, to see into the truth, lest they should be caught in some trap, that Treslong detected Boisot’s meaning.
</p>
<p>
“How! even you look coldly on me? Suspicion at such a moment, when the angel of death is stooping over Leyden in the excess of the people’s joy, and bearded warriors are like children on Christmas eve?”
</p>
<p>
“My only fear is that hope may have blinded your eyes, and the enemy’s malice have set a snare for us,” said Louis de Boisot, averting his face from the Captain.
</p>
<p>
“Heavens! how black I must have been painted. Let my heartburst then I could stand the seductions and threats of the enemy; I was not beaten even by the despair of hunger; but now that the confidence of friends changes to suspicion, granite could not bear that; and my heart is but poor flesh and blood.”
</p>
<p>
Sjoert Enkerken pushed forward, shoved the officers aside who stood round Treslong, as if he alone had the right to be at his side. In fact, wounded feeling operated so powerfully upon a frame over-taxed by the starvation of weeks, and the morning’s exertions, that poor Treslong needed support, or he would have fallen to the deck. Sjoert was the man to keep him up. He uttered a string of curses and maledictions, and threw his arm round his Captain as tenderly as if he had been a sweetheart, while he shouted in perfect fury:
</p>
<p>
“To ‘the Margaret!’ Fury seize the blind boobies who blink in daylight as if they could not see for the sun’s rays! Come to mine and Réné’s good ship; there you are on friend’s ground, and I will be an old woman alongside a child, and feed it up with milk sop and gruel, if your cause is not soon put to rights with the Prince, and make the envious bite their own tongues off for maligning you.”
</p> 
<p>He carried the Captain down into his boat, and was soon aboard “the Margaret.”
</p>
<p>
When the galleys came to the fort, they heard, instead of a sharp salute from the guns, the shout of “Orange for ever” from the men that had been brought over by Gerard van der Laan. Carpenters from the city, and the Zealanders soon tore up the stakes in the bed of the river with which the Spaniards had barred it, and without obstacle the whole fleet passed into the town.
</p> 
<p>   
In spite of the rapidity of the last events, the vessels were not unexpected. With the speed of light the news flew through the city that they were relieved. What numbers of emaciated, decrepid beings issued forth to the gates, to receive the liberators of Leyden The sight was horrifying. The bridge over the Vliet, through which Boisot and the vessels with the provisions came, was covered with human beings who could barely testify by their motions that they were not corpses. On the shore, on the dams, into the lanes, poured forth the crowd. Old men and children, women and men, all bore the same marks of the most dreadful hunger. The city resounded with the cry “Leyden is relieved — God be praised!” But on the banks of the river, the only greeting was “Bread — bread,” and a thousand spectre hands were stretched forward to receive it.
</p>
<p>
A distribution and a great expenditure of the necessaries of life was not a thing to be thought o. The Admiral opened some of his barrels, and the Zealanders dipped into them and threw loaves, cheeses, and herrings on shore. Many of the unfortunate creatures could not wait for the boats, but sprang into the water and waded or swam up to them. Some poor creatures perished with the very morsels in their mouths, killed by the food their famished ravenings made them too eagerly devour. Others thinking of those they loved best in the world, who could not come to the fleet themselves, ran as swiftly as their weakness would allow, to gladden the hearts of the stay-at-homes with the biscuits and herrings they had picked up in the scramble. 
</p>
<p>
Great, indeed, was the triumph of Boisot, happily as rare in history as Leyden’s terrible disasters. It was a joy so mighty, that ordinary hearts would have burst under the reaction; but those men had passed through the fiery ordeal of their unimagined misery, and that might have fortified them. That was indeed, the Lord’s day, when all Leyden and Holland bent the knee, when every thought was a canticle, every breath a thanksgiving. 
</p>
<p>
The 3rd of October, 1574, was not however a day of the Lord in its indications only; for it was on Sunday that the siege was raised. 
</p>
<p>
When Boisot had sailed down the Vliet with his Zealanders, and had come ashore, he ordered that the St. Jacob’s tavern should be opened to all who came and asked for food. Then he and his troops, sailors, and many of the citizens, went to church to offer up their prayers to the Almighty for the deliverance of the city. 
</p>
<p>
What a hymn of praise was that! How wonderful and solemn was the peal of the organ! The preacher, why stayed he so long on his knees, and who might have known what words he uttered when trembling he stood up There was not a soul in all that congregation that did not understand him well. The word of God needed no interpreter. The psalms, too, were tears and sobs. The organ, ever and anon, stopped under the faltering hands of its player, and all was dumb, save the flood of joyful, happy tears. 
</p>
<p>
So shall one day all nature pray, when at the resurrection all nations, free from earthly bonds, shall rise. Brother shall meet sister, friend meet friend, and solemnize the great day!
</p>
<p>
Divine service was succeeded by the pealing of the bells, seconded by the salutes of the artillery from the walls, to announce the relief of the city to all far and near. 
</p>
<p>
The Prince’s halberdier, Hans von Brügge, was the man that conveyed the intelligence to his illustrious master, whom he found sitting in deep mental tribulation in the church. He received the glorious intimation, and instantly had it announced from the pulpit. Delft joined in the jubilee, which soon traversed all Holland. The States presented the fortunate messenger, who had made such extraordinary speed, with a magnifilargess.
</p> 
<p>
The Zealanders alone in Leyden made no day of rejoicing. They threw themselves into the enemy’s lines, and such was the terror caused by their appearance, that two whole companies of the Spaniards, seeing about a dozen of their enemies advancing together, took to their heels and never stopped to rally, until they were safe in Amsterdam. All the fortifications were instantly abandoned, even Leyderdorf, where Valdez made his last stand. But his vanity ascribed his defeat, not to the bravery of the Netherlanders, but to the elements. 
</p>
<p>
The victors found a plan of Leyden in Valdez’s quarters, which included all the entrenchments and redoubts encircling the city. Under it the General had written “Vale civitas, valete castella parva, quae relicta estis propter aquam et non per vim inimicorum.” As if to contradict this assertion, the Spaniards had lost one thousand men; but not by water. On the side of the Netherlanders, a loss only of forty was returned. 
</p>
<p>
As soon as the wind had carried the fleet up to Leyden, it changed, and drove the waters back. The inundation was so shallow a few days after, that scarcely a boat could pass from Leyden into Delft. It was no longer requisite to send the fleet out to sea, the rivers could be easily navigated. 
</p>
<p>
The populace believed it all a miracle.
</p>

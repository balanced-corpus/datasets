<!-- Chapter 30 -->
<p>After the gloomy incident of the morning, and the terrible revelation I had just heard from my companion’s lips, a mere visit to a sick man was not an ordeal from which I had any reason to shrink; and yet the thought of it oppressed me more than all the rest. I had not yet got over the shock of that silent interview with Brother Alec, the circumstances of which, contrasted with my uncle’s experience of his condition, were so inexplicable to me; and his apartments, perhaps from my long and mysterious exclusion from them, had a sort of Blue-beard’s chamber “attraction of repulsion” for me, which I was ashamed to confess even to myself. It was with a beating heart, therefore, that I followed Mr. Wilde upstairs, past the chamber from which, though she had left me so desolate, I felt thankful that my darling had been removed, and the door of which now stood open for the first time for months; past the room, too, from which its lifeless tenant had been borne that morning, and where my own eyes had made the search the result of which had caused her to perish miserably by her own hand.</p>
<p>At the door of Brother Alec’s sitting-room Mr. Wilde made a moment’s pause, then entered abruptly and without knocking, and I followed close upon his heels. It was, as I expected to find it,
vacant; then he passed swiftly through into the other room, from which, as usual, the light was almost excluded by curtains and shutters. In the bed I could just discern the form of the sick man,
with his face turned towards the darkened Window. Mr. Wilde approached it, but it did not move.</p>
<p>“Mr. Raeburn, Mr. Raeburn!” cried I loudly, for the silence, as before, was getting intolerable to me. “Mr. Wilde has come to see you; will you not speak to him?”</p>
<p>There was a moment’s pause, and then the monotonous cry that I knew so well broke forth at my elbow : “Dead, dead, dead! Only think of that!”</p>
<p>“The parrot is right,” observed Mr. Wilde, calmly.</p>
<p>“Great Heaven!” cried I in horror, “you don’t mean to say that Mr. Alexander is lying there a corpse.”</p>
<p>“There is no Mr. Alexander here at all, Sheddon,” answered my companion, and at the same time he threw open the shutters and let a flood of light into the room. Then I saw that the thing I had
taken for the invalid was but a bundle of clothes cunningly disposed so as to represent a human form. Everything in the apartment was in accordance with its character of sick room: the phials on the mantelpiece, the watcher’s chair by the bedside, spoke of ministrations and tendance; but of the man for whom these tokens of solicitude existed there was no trace.</p>
<p>“What on earth has become of him? Dead or alive, where is he hidden?” asked I, in amazement.</p>
<p>“I cannot answer that question, Sheddon,” replied Mr. Wilde; “though that he is dead—and buried—I have no doubt. What you saw a week ago was this same Eidolon—this counterfeit presentment—which we see now, and in my opinion there has been nothing else here for months. Mr. Alexander Raeburn never returned from Sandibeach.”</p>
<p>“But I have seen him, certainly once since then, for I conversed with him; and my uncle has had two interviews with him—one in Mr. Sinclair’s presence, and the other alone, not a week ago!”</p>
<p>“You have all been deceived, Sheddon, though by what means I cannot guess. Mr. Alexander was never here; of that I am confident. The forged certificate; the seclusion in which his family shrouded him; and, above all, this pretence of his presence here, convince me of the fact. Some one has played his part on the few occasions when it was necessary, and played it successfully.”</p>
<p>A sudden revelation, in the likeness of John Raeburn to his uncle, here broke in upon me.</p>
<p>“It must have been John Raeburn!” cried I. “I remember now that he was said to be away from home on both dates of my uncle’s coming. It must have been he who lay in that bed and fooled us all.”</p>
<p>“And to some purpose, too,” observed Mr. Wilde, grimly, “since he thereby obtained two payments of an annuity for a man who was dead and buried. He must have forged the medical certificate, too, in the first instance, which brought the secretary down from town, and if he had but known that a second was necessary, this game might have gone on for years. It is not an original idea, Sheddon. There was a bishop once, who, thanks to an intelligent housekeeper, received his episcopal revenues for several quarters after his demise; but it was a very clever contrivance, for all that.”</p>
<p>The cynical tone of my companion jarred upon my feelings. The ingenuity of this nefarious scheme excited in me no admiration. I only thought of the shame of its discovery, which must not only
overwhelm the perpetrators of the fraud, but affect others wholly innocent of it. I now perceived why my Uncle Hastings had been fixed upon to certify to the fact of Alexander Raeburn’s existence;
the guilelessness of his nature, and the carelessness with which all business matters, whether of his own or others, were transacted by him, had pointed him out as a fit instrument for the attorney’s designs. Moreover, he was a personal acquaintance of Mr. Sinclair, which had, of course, assisted in putting that gentleman off his guard. I called to mind the agitation which Mark Raeburn had exhibited on the occasion of the secretary’s coming, and his exhilaration of spirits when the ordeal above-stairs had been successfully concluded, and recognised their cause.</p>
<p>“Is there no possible way, think you, Mr. Wilde?” inquired I, “whereby this matter may be hushed up and restitution made?”</p>
<p>“It is quite out of the question,” answered my companion; “for my part, I have done enough already to save the tenants of this house from public shame. It is impossible for us to explain Mr.
Alexander Raeburn’s absence; and it is necessary on all accounts that his death should be proved. Come—you had better come home with me for the present, since this house will be in the hands
of the police before nightfall. I should not be doing my duty if I did not communicate with them, and with the Assurance Society, at once.”</p>
<p>I was about to turn away to accompany my companion from the room, when the voice of the parrot once more was heard in imploring tones: “Dead, dead! think of that! Poor Poll, poor Poll!”</p>
<p>Chico’s once ample vocabulary had dwindled down to those few pitiful words. Their eloquence, however, was not lost upon me, and taking up his cage I carried the bird from the deserted room,
determined that henceforth, for Brother Alec’s sake it should form a part of my own goods and chattels—a resolve on which I had, afterwards, good cause for self-congratulation. It was impossible
for me to proceed at once to Stanbrook, since my presence would almost certainly be required in Kirkdale by the authorities, so I gladly accepted Mr. Wilde’s offer of hospitality, and while staying under his roof I became acquainted, through the investigations that followed, with various particulars respecting the attorney and his son, who both, to my great contentment, contrived to leave England before the law could be brought to bear upon them.</p>
<p>Mark Raeburn’s love of speculation had ruined him long before I had made his acquaintance, and when his name and credit in the district still stood high. After losing his own money, he lost that of his wife, who had had a considerable dower of her own, besides that West India estate, her involuntary disconnection with which had made the Emancipation question such a tender topic with
her. The knowledge that he had done her this wrong no doubt assisted to give her that supremacy over him which had ended in an unmitigated despotism. After these mischances, the attorney
strove to right matters by speculating with the fortune of his cousin Gertrude, which he also lost. I heard this part of his sad story from her own lips, as she had heard it from his, on that last interview he had with her before his flight. He made a clean breast of all his iniquities so far as she was concerned, and I need not say that she forgave him. Why he did so, I am not certain; but I think it was to exonerate his son from any share in them. Up to the time that that bubble of expectations from Brother Alec had burst, I believe John to have been wholly innocent of his father’s schemes, as Mark in his turn was of his wife’s attempted crime. In other respects the attorney and his wife worked together, I have little doubt, and had no secrets from one another. Having once stooped to defraud his Cousin, he had no scruples as to his other clients, and almost all my uncle’s little property had gone the way of Gertrude’s. Mark had disposed of the securities, which were not, and never had been, in Kirkdale bank; and the duplicates I had found were merely imitations of them, far too clumsy to have been concocted by the deft fingers of John Raeburn. Had he been intrusted with the task, my suspicions would probably never have been aroused, and indeed his innocence was established by the fact of his having procured me a sight of the papers in his father’s absence. On the latter’s return from the seaside, he had been compelled to make his son his confidant, and henceforth the partner in his frauds. It was John who had written in his uncle’s name from Sandibeach, where the old man was dying, or perhaps already dead; he had been buried there under the name of Prescott (as was afterwards discovered), and John, under pretence, as usual, of a business journey elsewhere, had gone thither, and been brought back from thence in his uncle’s stead, to play the <em>rôle</em> of the sick man at the Priory.</p>
<p>He did so to perfection, including the forging of the receipts of his quarterly payments from the Assurance Office; but I will do him the justice to assert that his dishonesty went wholly against the grain with him. He was not, of course, a well-principled lad in any Sense, but his nature was neither cruel nor unkind, and I believe revolted against the very scheme which his ingenuity for a time rendered so successful. If poverty be any excuse for crime, it was so in his case (not to mention that he was spurred on by his own parents to commit it), for it turned out that the Raeburns had had little else to maintain them, at the time of my coming to live with them, beyond my premium and the annual sum paid for my board and lodging; while, afterwards, they lived on the credit accorded to them by reason of their expectations from Brother Alec, which they were well aware would never be realised. It was, doubtless, the embarrassment produced by this state of affairs in its earlier stage, and the knowledge that his defalcations must needs be brought to light, in case Gertrude should become engaged out of the family, that inspired the attorney with the idea of persuading me that her hand was already promised to John. Very likely the notion of having her for their daughter-in-law had at one time occurred to the old couple, but before my coming to the Priory I am sure that
Mrs. Raeburn, at least, had given up the plan as impracticable. She read Gertrude’s character too thoroughly to deceive herself in that respect. It was not till matters grew desperate that this wretched woman conceived the crime which she had been within such a tittle of having accomplished; and I again assert my confident belief that neither her husband nor her son were privy to her design. There were degrees and grades of guilt in these three persons, each strongly marked. John’s transgression, though he took such an active part in the plot, was in fact of a negative character; the attorney, by long mis-doing, had become reckless and fraudulent to the core; while Mrs. Raeburn was ruthless from the beginning, and stuck at nothing. Of her I shall presently have a word or two more to say in proof of that harsh judgment.</p>
<p>These facts or convictions did not present themselves to me at once, nor within a brief space; it was weeks before my presence at Kirkdale could be dispensed with by the authorities, and my mind was compelled to concern itself with these sad matters, from the consideration of which it would gladly have escaped. Otherwise, I had sufficiently bitter food for reflection in the position of my own affairs. Not only was Gertrude’s fortune lost, but my own little property, which had been confided by Mr. Hastings, along with his own, to the attorney’s keeping, was also gone. Not only, therefore, had I no expectations for the future, but no means, however anxious I might be to make up for previous idleness by application to my legal studies, of continuing them. The question was no
longer, When should we marry? but, How should we each subsist apart? From the ruins of her property, indeed, the attorney had pointed out how a small income might be derived for Gertrude’s maintenance, but the sum was so slender as scarcely to afford her the necessaries of life. She wrote to me hopefully, but I had not the courage to reply to her in a similar strain. I was a beggar;
and though the thought seemed to pull my heart up by the roots, I felt that it would be my duty to release her from an engagement which it might never be in my power to redeem.</p>
<p>If I had had anywhere else whither to betake myself, I should have avoided the temptation of going to the Rectory while Gertrude remained under its roof; but there was no alternative for me in the matter, and so soon as I was permitted to leave Kirkdale I bade good-bye to my kind host, and, sick at heart, departed for my old home.</p>

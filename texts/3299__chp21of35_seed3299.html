<!-- CHAPTER 9.<br>-->
<p>“I’ve seen the most angelic creature eyes ever beheld, Austin,” exclaimed he of the white visage, now rendered, by his recent illness, far whiter than ever. “Without exception, she is the most perfect combination of loveliness I ever encountered. If it had not been for that lynx-eyed duéña, I would have introduced myself; but, as it is, I made my feelings pretty intelligible.”</p>
<p>“More than you could have accomplished by your language, I imagine,” I replied.</p>
<p>“Likely enough,” he answered; “but the method I adopted, to make myself understood, seemed successful in as far as I could desire. Signs, old fellow, signs will do more for a man, any day, than language, unless it be the language of the eyes; and I’ll knock under to no man in that accomplishment. I’ll bet fifty to one you’ll say she’s the very perfection of symmetry itself. Such hands, feet, eyes, hair, and figure! But what’s the good of talking to you, who don’t know her? You can’t feel as I do! No! It’s impossible you can?”</p> 
<p>I dare say not,” I rejoined, laughing; “but beware of getting into some awful scrape in this place. Recollect that, in four days, you leave Vittoria; and, having steered clear of trouble hitherto, there cannot be any advantage in thrusting your neck into the noose at this the eleventh hour. Moreover, you will bear in mind that the Spaniards are the most revengeful fellows in existence; and the odds are that this fair incognita of yours is surrounded with as many cousins, uncles and brothers as there are saints in the calendar, and each of them furnished with a not always blunt <i>cuchillo</i>, the blade of which you may find about the same length as their pedigrees. I ‘d advise you to think no more about her.”</p>
<p>“Think no more about her, indeed,” was the reply. “Easy enough for you to say ‘think no more about her;’ but I’d rather lose the best horse I have in my stable, if, indeed, I <i>have</i> any left me, than forego the chance of again beholding that more than seraphic countenance.” And here the white-faced mortal launched forth into such marvellous hyperboles as to make it too decidedly evident he was bent on destruction.</p>
<p>“I’m determined to see her, old follow,” he continued. “Aye, and see her within twenty- four hours, too, and, by all that’s dangerous, you shall behold her likewise, my boy; ‘t will do your heart good. Such ancles, such feet, such a walk!” And off he went again, through all the endearing terms the English language could supply, at a pace that would have killed the Holyhead mail to have tried at.</p>
<p>“I should be very sorry were you to trouble yourself on my account,” was my answer. “I can readily take your word for the lady’s beauty, without having occular proof — so never mind me, in the least degree.”</p>
<p>“But I <i>do</i> mind you, in a very considerable degree,” he answered sharply; “and if you don’t accompany me, Austin, I shall take it very unkind, indeed, on your part.”
<p>“Accompany you where?” I inquired.</p>
<p>“Never mind where, just at present. I’ll let you know in due time, the moment I’ve completed my arrangements: so, farewell, till dinner — recollect, I’ll take no excuse; but expect you’ll stick by me through thick and thin, let happen what may.” And off he started, to concoct as mad an exploit as his debtors — if any such people existed — could have desired.</p>
<p>In my then weak state, both of body and nerves, I would willingly have been spared the task of accompanying him in the expedition which he seemed so extremely anxious to thrust on me; but, recollecting all the privations and annoyances to which he had subjected himself during my illness, I could not refuse, at his solicitation, to do that which my own judgement condemned as a superabundant piece of extravagant folly; yet, having once made up my determination to go, I bethought me of the necessary precautions, and, among others, of borrowing a brace of small pistols, which I engaged as my companions for the occasion.</p>
<p>Italy is the land of song, aye, and love likewise; but surely there are other spots where ‘the fire, once enkindled, becomes impetuous and is sometimes devastating in its effects.’ And where, more so, than in Spain? It is, alas! but too true that the days of her splendour have passed away — that glorious epoch, when the conquering Moslem, extending his warlike and skilful hordes through her beauteous valleys and sunny plains — erected his gorgeous mosques and gilded palaces in the midst of the fragrant groves and luxurious gardens which, on every side, invited the conqueror to fix his home — and where, as if by magic, sprung up those works of elaborate taste, the remains of which are still visible, striking the beholder with wonder and amazement, as the unparalleled achievements of those whom, in our ignorance, we are pleased to term barbarians, are unfolded to our view.</p>
<p>That period has passed. Yet, though the martial sound of the Moorish cymbal and the neigh of the impatient war-steed have ceased to be heard at the gate of the golden-roofed Harem; and though the aromatic perfumes of Asia no longer ascend from the enamelled vase, winding their odoriferous clouds amid the silvery shower from the marble fountains, impregnating the cool air with a most delicious fragrance; and though her days of luxury and glory be no more — still the bosoms of her daughters throb with as fierce and conflicting passions now as ever influenced the dark-eyed maidens in times long past.</p>
<p>The lovely object who, wandering listlessly along the banks of the bright Guadalquiver, brushing the various flowers which bestrew the path with the gentle pressure of her delicate foot, though simply adorned in the dark, yet ever graceful, mantilla, and divested of all the magnificence of apparel with which her equals, though not superiors, in loveliness were accustomed to array themselves — that fragile form, that delicate being, possesses a heart which, if touched by the resistless shaft of love, might blaze forth with an energy and fervour unsurpassed by any record of what the female character, when fearfully excited, is capable of performng — for good — or, for evil.</p>
<p>There are scenes of magnificent beauty and spots of loveliness in Spain, which it would be difficult to excel by comparison with any others. The ever varying tints of the evening sun, reclining on the sides and summits of the distant mountains, and touching with his glorious rays the transparent stream, as it majestically winds along their base, with the numberless gay pavilions which rear their picturesque heads from beds of the most fragrant exotics, make the scene, at that hour in particular, appear more beautiful than ever.</p>
<p>Groves of the luscious orange, the fragrant citron, and the wide spreading fig-tree, add to the splendour of the landscape, and fill the air with their refreshing perfumes. And the tall palm and dark-leaved cork tree raise their exalted heads amid a wilderness of blooming geraniums, vine and aloe, intermixed with an almost endless variety of fruit, flower, and shrub, such as no other country can boast.</p>
<p>In the calm stillness of the summer’s evening, in such a scene as this, may be heard the wild notes of the guitar issuing from the porch of many a rustic hamlet, ornamented with the sweet smelling jessamine and rose, while the little dwelling is hemmed in and protected by an impassable boundary of prickly pear. At such an hour, when the dull, tedious labours of the day no longer clog the soul of man with the monotonous occurrences of human toil, then it is that a soft feeling of conscious, yet calm, happiness, creeps over the mind; and in such a moment is it that the voice of one loved strikes with an electricity upon the heart, causing an acknowledged reciprocity of affection, to the exclusion of all other earthly things, but which, in all probability, a less tranquil and delicious moment might have failed in creating.</p>
<p>Those who dwell on the soft influence of the soul-stirring glances, from the eyes of “Italy’s daughters,” to the exclusion of all others — cannot have visited Spain. But I have made too long a digression from my narrative, and must recal my wandering imagination to the reality of the pale-faced officer’s exploits, who had been busily engaged, since we parted, in collecting a fund of information, scraped together by the aid of bits of French, Spanish, English and Italin; but, on endeavouring to connect his variegated intelligence bit by bit, as children do a puzzle, he found it impossible to make any two pieces accord.</p>
<p>Giving up, therefore, all hope of succeeding in his own <i>propria persona</i>, without foreign aid, he resolved on procuring a deputy; to effect which, he put enquiries on foot, as to the eligibility of the various applicants for the honour of the appointment; but the qualifications required by the Cornet were so diametrically opposite to those professed by the aspirants that he was nearly in despair at his ill fortune. The two essential requisites demanded, were unbounded obedience to whatever order he might issue, and matchless cunning and effrontery to carry such mandates into execution.</p>
<p>It is not every body who would have acknowledged himself sufficiently talented to perform the duties exacted, with such ability and success as to prove himself no novice at his employment; but, at length, one gentleman presented himself who, if the face be a mirror of the mind, had an undoubted right of priority to the place over all those who had preceded him in his application.</p>
<p>This worthy was a native of Andalusia; and as, perchance, some of my fair readers may not have had opportunities of beholding any of those people, in their original, native state, I will briefly describe him. His age could not have exceeded six-and-twenty. His figure was slight — well formed and tall — his features handsome — but the deep cunning that twinkled in his hazel eyes, and the disagreeable leer which hung about the corners of his lips, destroyed the otherwise prepossessing appearance of his countenance. Like the rest of his countrymen, his hair was dark, and curled closely round his forehead — he wore small whiskers — no moustaches — and the shirt, open at the throat, discovered a finely formed, muscular, yet sun-burnt, neck. He had on the brown leather shoes of his country, which were joined by a gaiter of the same colour, curiously marked and extending to within a few inches of the knee, leaving the calf of the leg exposed — the gaiter being fastened simply by one loop at the bottom and one at the top, where it was met by his inexpressible garments of a mulberry-coloured cloth, fitting tight to the shape, and having a thickly studded row of silver buttons descending by each outward seam. As I before said, he wore his shirt open at the breast, disclosing his very white and well plaited linen — a blue silk handkerchief was tied loosely about his neck, fastening with a large knot in front, ornamented by a brooch. His waistcoat (of velvet) was likewise adorned with a profusion of silver tags and buttons, while the jacket, made of the skin of a black lamb, and similarly bedecked, formed the outer covering to his person. Round the waist was twisted, in many folds, the ever present red sash, bearing in its creases the <i>euchilla</i>, or knife, without which the Spaniard never moves. His head was bound round with a gaudy coloured handkerchief, leaving the ends hanging over the nape of the neck to protect it from the influence of the sun. Surmounting all, was the black hat, shaped somewhat like a sugar loaf, decorated by a broad velvet band round the centre — while a very extensive rim, turned up equally all round, completed his dress.</p>
<p>I was present when he made his appearance, and his intended master and himself seemed to understand each other immediately.</p>
<p>“You know the description of person I want?” enquiringly asked the Cornet, in a language of any country you please, but which he denominated true Castihan — “you know what I want?”</p>
<p>“Si, Señor,” replied the guide, for such was his calling, when at home, at Ronda.</p>
<p>“And you engage to do any thing whatever, that I may require of you, without scruple?” was the next question. </p>
<p>“Si, Señor.”</p>
<p>“Bien está,” replied the Cornet. “Work well and I’ll pay well.”</p>
<p>“Puede usted, darme un poco de dinero adelanta do?”</p>
<p>“What, you want some down, do you?”</p>
<p>“Si, Señor, si usted gusta.” And accordingly a doublon was produced on the table; and the Andalusian swallowing a glass of <i>aguardiénte</i>, by way of ratifying the engagement, departed.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the time had now arrived when I might make further enquiries on the subject of our intended adventure; and the account my friend gave, of the leading features of the case, was not at all calculated to diminish my anxiety as to the possible result.</p>
<p>The object of the white-faced gentleman’s sudden attachment proved to be the Señorita Agnes Ildefonso, the only daughter of as proud and haughty a Spaniard as his native town of Soria, in Old Castile, could produce. Not dissimilar to the generality of Castilian Nobles, the contending parties and conflicting interests of those whose misgovernment had for years rent the bosom of his once splendid country stripped him of most part of his worldly goods, leaving little beyond his Castilian pride and prejudice to exist on.</p>
<p>By one of those sudden freaks of fortune, 
which so seldom benefit those on whom the 
advantage appears to fall, a distant relation of 
the pompous Don departed this life, bequeathing to the Señorita Agnes the undisputed possession of some six or seven thousand <i>pesos duros</i>, or, in English money, somewhere about twelve or fourteen hundred pounds. This sum, to the eyes of the naturally abstemious Spaniard, opened endless visions of the everlasting <i>olla podrida</i> flavoured with the detestable <i>ajo</i> or garlick. And it Avas not until the learned <i>abogado</i> of Soria had pointed out the impossibility of any part of his daughter’s money being appropriated to himself that the disappointed old gentleman seemed to consider the bequest as a personal insult towards him, and an unpardonable crime committed by his daughter.</p>
<p>In this feeling he was greatly encouraged by divers huge-whiskered sons, each of whom, attracted by the news of this vast accession of wealth, had rapidly returned from his obscure place of abode, hoping to participate in a share of the unexpected windfall. Judge, then, what their feelings must have been when made acquainted with the lawyer’s decision! At first, they boldly denied the correctness of his assertion, but on that head they were speedily and painfully put right; yet, loud and manifold 
were their exclamations of rage and disappointment, when the old, hoary-headed sire devised that common, though refined, piece of cruelty, — which, thank God, no longer exists, of forcing his child to take the veil.</p>
<p>No sooner was this infamous project broached than the proposal was rapturously acceded to by the male members of the family, and, well knowing the rapacity of the superiors in all convents and monasteries throughout Spain, they straightway adopted eveiy fraud and deceit that artifice could suggest, in the hope of depreciating the amount of their sister’s possessions in the eyes of the world. To place her in a convent within his own province, where the story of her fortune was probably a familiar topic of conversation, could not be thought of, since the Church would demand the whole of her riches, as a return for admittance within the sacred pale. It was therefore judged expedient to proceed to Vittoria, where, amid the excitement of the times and the stirring occurrences which the period had given birth to, it was, at least, improbable that the tale of the Señor’s domestic affairs should have held a place in the knowledge of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>In this conjecture they were correct; and, for a far less sum than had been anticipated, it was agreed that the Señorita was to enter on her noviciate, and, in due time, take that irrevocable step — the veil; leaving the remainder of her money for the plunder of relations, by whom she was to be offered up, a lovely and unwilling sacrifice, to a living tomb.</p>
<p>One old and hideous duéña was the sole being, of her own sex, who was permitted to approach her person, and whose greedy anticipation of receiving the promised portion of the blood money rendered her doubly vigilant and alert. Thus, through the intended kindness of her relation, this lovely and gentle-hearted girl was singled out, as an object for unceasing persecution by her kindred, until the gates of the dreaded building should have closed, between her and the world, for ever; but only to undergo those austere penances and privations within, which the discontented superiors of the mis-named religious houses heaped upon the heads of those unfortunate sufferers who, by the machinations of sordid avarice, cruelty, or detestation, had been cast within their dreaded meshes.</p>
<p>The whole family was assembled at Vittoria, having taken a house adjoining the convent where the wretched girl was to be immured for ever; and the only time she had been permitted to cross the threshhold, even when accompanied by the ever-watchful duéña, was two days previous, when the Cornet returned to our lodgings in such ecstacies regarding her.</p>
<p>It was about five o’clock in the afternoon the day before, when our Andalusian guide withdrew from the conference with his employer, having first received orders to be in close attendance by seven, to obtain further instructions; and, as the day after that following was the one fixed upon for the Señorita’s admission into the convent, it was evident that there was no time to be lost. Yet, although not overscrupulous in most things, I pondered, before aiding and abetting in an act which, for aught I could tell to the contrary, might hereafter assume rather a disagreeable complexion on the tablets of my memory; and, determining to avoid all unpleasant reminiscences, as far as laid in my power, I resolved to ascertain, from my gallant companion in arms, the precise nature of what the ladies in Ireland are pleased to denominate <i>“his intintions.”</i></p>
<p>The pale-faced lover was industriously engaged in the careful examination of the locks of a brace of long-barrelled Spanish pistols, when I interrupted him, requesting to be furnished with a more elaborate explanation of his final views than he had as yet favoured me with — ending with the simple, but not to be misunderstood enquiry, as to the line of conduct he proposed to adopt, in the event of our succeeding in rescuing her from her impending fate, which sacrifice he declared the lady to contemplate as a final extinction to all her earthly ideas of happiness.</p>
<p>“All right, old fellow,” replied my companion, “right as the mail; my Audalusian friend has not been idle, I assure you; and, by dint of money and management, I’ve opened a correspondence with the Señorita herself, in which she declares her readiness to trust herself, honour and all, in my keeping, with a perfect reliance on the word of a British officer — so what can I do, my boy? cant flinch — double round — cut — and leave the poor girl to her fate — that won’t be fair; I must work through the business, the game’s on the cards, and by the Immaculate, I’ll play it out.”</p>
<p>“Well, well,” I rejoined, “that’s all fair enough; but do you mean to marry her? Recollect your family, your connections, your being on the eve of marching up to join your regiment, your never having seen the lady but once, your complete ignorance of her temper, disposition, and ten thousand other good and cogent reasons why you should let this affair drop. It’s not too late, yet; and, though you may regret the loss of your adventure at the moment, you will be amply rewarded for your present forbearance hereafter.”</p> 
<p>My dear friend,” answered the Cornet, “you greatly mistake. It <i>is</i> too late to be off, far too late; but, even were it not so, I pledge you my word I would not desist in this, affair until I had been so worsted as to prove the utter impossibility of success; but, at present, every thing in the undertaking prospers, and to-night, or never, the poor girl shall be emancipated from her thraldom; you ask, do I mean to many her? my reply is, a regret that you had not conceived a better opinion of me than to suppose otherwise. And, wild as I may have appeared in many of our by-gone freaks, I trust you do not suppose me so consummate a fool as to rush headlong into matrimony, without knowing something regarding the family of my wife. I have made full and ample inquiries, and they have been minutely, and in a most satisfactory manner, replied to.”</p>
<p>“Don Julian Raineus Diogracias Ildefonso — that is what the old gentleman lugs through the world by way of a name — can boast of possessing in his veins as pure blood as circulates through the body of any noble in Old Castile; and it would take as long to work through the pedigree of his family as it would occupy in teaching a marine to ride. Her mother’s name and titles would reach from here to Ostend; and the consummate pride of the whole batch is only to be equalled in amount by what old Burslem’s horror must have been when he took his coy, loving bride to his arms.”</p>
<p>“Then, why the devil do you marry into such a family ?” I enquired.</p>
<p>“Why not?” replied the Cornet; “I’m not going to marry old Don Damnable, with the thousand names; neither do I mean to have any thing to do with the three whiskered brothers; all I want, is the lady. In point of family, hers is as good as mine — in regard to money, I have enough for both. The French have been driven over the Pyrenees, and we shall soon have peace; and, what’s more, there is an adventure in the case, and so I’m as fixed as fate.”</p>
<p>Perceiving the futility of further argument on the subject, and knowing the almost impossibility of turning my friend’s thoughts into another channel, when a practical joke, or desperate adventure, was on hand, I forbore pressing his relinquishment on the affair; and merely inquired how he intended to proceed.</p>
<p>“Ha! ha! ha!” laughed the Cornet, squinting down one of the pistol barrels which he had just cleaned to his satisfaction, “why, you’ve turned wag in your old days, Harry — proceed indeed! why, my dear boy, at this moment, Don Fusbos, or whatever that terrible long name of his may be, is proceeding along the high road to Soria, in a state of mind bordering on madness — proceed! by my faith, Harry, thanks to the Andalusian, the game proceeds bravely — started the governor — bagged the duéña.”</p> 
<p>“How do you mean, bagged the duéña?” I inquired.</p>
<p>“Why, I mean exactly what I say:” and the Cornet laughed and chuckled, until his pale face became the colour of a cardinal’s hat. “What! did’nt you know I had got her?”</p>
<p>“Got her! not I, how should I? where is she?”</p>
<p>“There,” he sputtered out, hardly able to articulate from laughing, and pointing to a door which led to an inner apartment — “There — in a sack — ha! ha! ha!</p>
<p>In a moment, I rushed into the room, and, to my utter amazement, squatting in a corner like a hare on her form, was the shrivelled head and features of a horrible old woman of about sixty — a slight bandage was passed across her mouth, to prevent any undue articulation on her part; while the end of a sack, in which she was placed, tied tightly round her throat, afforded at once a durable frill to the neck, and a stout covering for the lower part of her body. Her little black eyes flashed most indignantly, and, though it was impossible for her to raise her voice in invective, she ever and anon gave her head such fierce and sudden jerks as forcibly reminded me of the Mandarin figures you often see in the shops at Brighton, going at half-price, on account of being out of order.</p>
<p>“In Heaven’s name!” I exclaimed — “What’s this?”</p>
<p>“What’s what?” echoed the practical gentleman.</p>
<p>“Why, that thing in the sack?” I replied, pointing to the palsy-headed figure.</p>
<p>“That’s the duéña, my governess that is to be. Shall I introduce you?”</p>
<p>“Cease your nonsense,” I answered: “surely that’s not the way to treat a woman. What have you gagged her for?”</p> 
<p>“Because she hollows so confoundedly.”</p>
<p>“But why put her in a sack?”</p>
<p>” Because she scratches,” was the immediate answer.</p>
<p>“But tell me,” I continued, “how did you get her?”</p>
<p>“Oh, easy enough,” added the pale practitioner, “all varmint take bait — but I’ll tell you how it was; yet stay a bit, I don’t want to keep the old devil tied hand and foot, like an Ashantee waiting to be cooked for his friend’s dinner; but, if I let her loose, she fights and scratches worse than a dozen cats round a dog’s-meat man’s barrow.”</p>
<p>“Oh, nonsense,” I replied, “poor old wretch, let her out of that abominable sack — I’m ashamed to see a woman in such a state.”</p>
<p>“And I have a shrewd suspicion,” was the answer, “that you’d be ashamed to see yourself in the glass, if once she got her claws on your countenance. Why, she has already made ruts in the Andalusian’s face as deep as the furrows in a ploughed field, but, I’ll try her once more. Here, Juan,” and strightway he summoned his recently elected Prime Minister.</p>
<p>When Juan appeared, it was palpably evident that his master had “nothing extenuated, nor aught set down in malice,” as related to the imbounded freedom her nails had taken with the guide’s visage which presented a picture truly pitiable; yet, not withstanding his beauty had thus suffered a temporary obscurity, the good-humoured Spaniard seemed in no wise inclined to bear malice against this pugnaceous specimen of the fair sex; on the contrary, he willingly entered into our views, and, by means of his interpretation the duéña was persuaded to rest in quietness and silence, provided the impediments to the free use of her tongue and limbs were removed. This arrangement settled, and the antique dame having been frequently assured she should be placed at liberty and in safety, on the following morning, she was persuaded to sit down to a comfortable repast, and she had caused a considerable diminution of the contents of a bottle of <i>vino blanco,</i> ere we left her to the enjoyment of her own reflections.</p>
<p>I was naturally extremelv curious to know by what stratagem so cautious an old lady had been ensnared by the Cornet, and, having gained our own apartment, he thus unbosomed himself.</p>
<p>“I have already told you, old fellow,” he commenced, “that to-morrow morning will either see the Senorita Agnes my wife, or else the inmate of an impregnable convent; and as the former is the consummation most to be desired, I judged it expedient to remove from her person those individuals from whose caution and officiousness we have most to dread.</p>
<p>“To effect this, I proceeded with my trusty Andalusian to an <i>escribano publico</i>, or notary, who, I was informed, would — if paid for it — write as many lies in twelve minutes as any other man could speak in twelve months. Having found this worthy, he readily undertook to pen a letter, as if from a respectable house in Soria, stating that circumstances had come to light, whereby it was proved that the Señorita Agnes was entitled to a much larger amount of her relation’s money than had hitherto been supposed; but so great was the villany of the executors that, unless the legal guardian of the lady made his immediate appearance, there was not the most remote chance of its being recovered. This precious epistle was then sealed and directed to the Don with the long name, and forthwith handed to Juan, who, having been first well crammed, as we used to say at Cambridge, was instructed to make his appearance at the old gentleman’s door, covered with dust and heat, as if just arrived from a long journey, for the purpose of delivering the packet and enjoining his instant departure.</p>
<p>“So far, so well; but, exclusive of that epistle, he was charged with another directed to the Duéña, in which the old lady was informed that her friend, the Don, was grossly deceiving her, by urging her acceptance of so small a pittance as was to be her share of the prize money; for, in point of fact, by the original will bequeathing the property, it expressly stated that a much larger sum than that which she was to receive ought to be handed over to the lady, whoever she might be, who superintended the Señorita’s education until she was nineteen; and, consequently, if her fair charge were immured within the walls of a convent, that sum would be lost to the Duéña for ever. The epistle further added that the writer was actuated only by a sense of justice, and if the lady would call at his house, naming our lodgings, immediately after morning mass, he would put her in possession of the important document.</p>
<p>“Off started Juan to the Don’s, when he knew the old lady would be absent at mass — rushed into the house —with the air of a man bearing intelligence of most vital import — crammed the letter into the old gentleman’s face — swore, with a marvellous rapidity, there was not a moment to lose — urged the necessity of expedition in such a powerful strain of elocution that the sons, seeing nothing beyond a further accumulation of wealth to themselves, willingly joined in his request — a vehicle which we had already prepared in a neighbouring street, drove briskly to the door; and before Don Julian Rainerus Diogracias Ildefonso thoroughly understood the purport of the letter which he held in his hand, consequently immeasurably prior to his possessing the least power of remonstrance, he was hoisted on the shoulders of his sons, thrust into the carriage, where one of Juan’s companions waited to receive him, and off they went, the Lord knows where; but his keeper is bound to detain him till to-morrow night. That bait having taken, away went Juan, changed his dress, and appeared at the church doors just as the worshippers were quitting it, and, having discovered the Duéña, it was no difficult matter to transfer the second letter from his possession into hers.</p>
<p>“Those who are habituated to the practice of deceit are ever ready in suspecting others, and so it proved, as I had anticipated; for, instead of giving herself time coolly to think the matter over, the little woman, furious at the supposition of having been deceived, rushed headlong from an imaginary danger into the actual toils prepared for her reception; willingly she obeyed the signal of the Andalusian to follow him, and, in ten minutes afterwards, we had her in the sack.</p>
<p>“Thus, old fellow, you will perceive, we are now rid of our two most formidable opponents. The old Don is wending his way God only knows whither; and the ancient lady thinks, at this moment, much more of her <i>vino blanco</i> than she does of the Señorita’s danger, for, of course, we have kept her in ignorance touching the departure of her confederate. But let’s have dinner, it’s getting late, and I think we may need refreshment before the night’s over.” To which proposal I willingly acceded; and, in as far as our libations went, we soon beat the old lady hollow.</p>
<p>“The mules are all ready, Señor,” said Juan, thrusting his learned physiognomy into our apartment.</p>
<p>“Bueno,” replied the adventurous Cornet, and straightway we sallied forth upon our expedition.</p>
<p>It was between ten and eleven o’clock. The night, unfortunately for us, was far from being as dark as we might have desired; but, as we wound our way along the narrow streets of the town, it was a source of gratification to find our passage uninterrupted by a single nocturnal promenader. All was as quiet as though the long close lanes we were threading boasted no human tenants in their mansions; and, excepting the noise occasioned by the mules’ progress over the ill-paved causeway, not a sound was to be heard in the city.</p>
<p>After many windings and cautious reconnoitrings round the neighbourhood of our destination, we were directed to dismount by the wall of a huge, old, pile of building, which the Comet informed me was the outside of the much dreaded convent. “Silencio,” whispered our guide, laying his finger on his lips, “silencio, Señores;” and accordingly we stood as grave and mute as Gog and Magog formerly did in Guildhall.</p>
<p>Having fastened our mules at some short distance from the house, preceded by Juan, we advanced to the attack, that skilful engineer having reconnoitred the fortress on the preceding day, in the hope of discovering some weak point in the defences, where his ingenuity might enable him to effect a breach in the walls, but, being baffled in his expectations, the scaling party was ordered to advance. Availing himself of the advantages offered by the projecting iron railings which, worked into a massive frame, invariably protect the lower windows of a Spanish house on the side looking into the street, and clinging to each protruding stone of the building, with the agility of a cat, Juan speedily attained the summit of the outer wall, when, having thereto firmly fixed the hook of the rope ladder which he carried with him, he soon rejoined us in the street.</p>
<p>The convent bells had not as yet chimed the midnight hour; and, although every thing outside the old gentleman’s house was as quiet as the grave, it was necessary to proceed with extreme caution, since the inside might not imitate a similar tranquility, the more so as the brothers must unavoidably be much chagrined and astonished at the prolonged and unusual absence of the Duéña.</p>
<p>Stealthily, and without uttering a syllable, the Cornet placed his foot on the rope, and commenced his ascent, followed by myself, while the guide firmly held the ladder at the bottom; but, before we had reached the top, an indistinct murmur of voices met our ears. At the recommendation of the Andalusian, we had divested ourselves of all cumbrous garments, not excepting our hats, in order to ensure the tree use of our limbs, if called upon for any extraordinaiy exertion. The moon was now shining in all her splendour, and willingly would we have foregone the beauty of her appearance, in exchange for a cloud as black and dingy as the outside of a mourning-coach; but, as wishing seldom produces the desired effect, so all we could do was cautiously to lay down on the broad top of the wall, the <i>guid</i> having selected that side for our ascent which was most thickly clothed in shade.</p>
<p>The scene now laid open to my view was picturesque in the extreme; and, for the first few seconds, while gazing on the group below, I entirely forgot the object which had drawn me to the spot. Not so my practical friend, for, although his eye embraced the whole, equally with mine, his ideas as to the different uses to which things and persons could be turned differed wonderfully from notions commonly entertained by his fellow mortals.</p>
<p>The generality of old Spanish houses are entered by a high archway, leading into a tolerably wide portico, furnished on both sides with marble benches, and having the sides and ceilings decorated with the arms of the proprietor, or other devices, worked in various coloured tiles and pebbles in the walls. At the end of this porch or entrance, stands the door opening into the building, a small grating being usually let in at the upper part, to enable the occupant to scan his visitor, previous to admitting him within his sanctuary. Having effected the entrance, you find yourself in a large, square court, in the centre of which, rising from a plat of velvet turf, a marble fountain sculptured according to the taste of the owner, throws up its cool delicious water, which, descending into the large basin beneath, with a soft gurgling sound, casts an irresistible charm and delightful languor over all within its influence. The citron and the fig-tree claim likewise their share of the court, while, from two opposite sides of the square, a broad flight of marble steps conducts you to the corridor which, running round the whole building, looks into the luxuriant garden; while the apartments, for the accommodation of the family, branch out from this shaded terrace, leading into the deeper interior of the mansion.</p>
<p>There were two lights glimmering through different parts of the gilt trellis work of the balcony; and close to one of which, as if cast by accident on the richly carved balustrade, lay a splendidly embroidered scarf — the golden threads, varying in appearance under the influence of the bright moon, vied in beauty with the diamond shower from the fountain. There was nothing whereby to mark the tenant of the apartment where the remaining light still flickered in its silver sconce; but, immediately beneath, and reposing in different attitudes under the spreading branches of the fragrant orange trees, the three brothers listlessly reposed, smoking the never-rejected cigar; not a syllable was exchanged among them — each being apparently fully occupied with his own thoughts.</p>
<p>The picturesque costume of the Spaniards, — the soft murmur from the fountain, the mellowed light peering through the elaborately worked lattice of the balconies, and the delicious perfumes from the adjacent flowers and shrubs completed a scene which, had the pencil of the artist been there to pourtray it, might have afforded ample scope for the exercise of his talents.</p>
<p>Without daring to move our bodies in the slightest degree, for fear of detection, there we all lay — Juan having joined us — as motionless as the coping of the wall on which we reclined; and I, for one, was fast forgetting the beauty of the scene, in the certainty of my unpleasant position, when a conversation was commenced by one of the two. What the subject might have been we were too distant to overhear; but I concluded it must have related to the absence of the old lady, for, after exchanging a few words with the others, one of the party rose — and, having opened the door leading into the porch, walked forth into the street. Here his examination was soon ended, for he almost immediately returned to his companions, having closed the street-door after him, but leaving the key in the lock as it had been before.</p>
<p>A few expressions of surprise were then uttered by all three; and, as if deeming it useless to tarry longer for the arrival of a person who, apparently, was no way inclined to make her appearance, two of the party rose from their recumbent positions, and, after sundry yawns and low-muttered execrations against the disturber of their night’s rest, they slowly and sleepily wound their way to the apartment where the last mentioned light still continued to flare its feeble flame.</p>
<p>Left to himself, the other Caballero commenced a fresh cigar, and it now became pretty evident that the gentlemen intended to take turn about, in watching through the night, and as the appearance of day light must unavoidably bring with it either the failure of our enterprize, or detection, we watched the proceedings of the brother with no small anxiety.</p>
<p>I thought the cigar never would have ended. Like the purse, in the Arabian Nights, that no one could empty, so it appeared to me that it was impossible to convert that piece of tobacco into smoke. Puff — puff — worked the Spaniard, yet there was no visible diminution of the weed, and I don’t know but it might have lasted up to this hour, had not the practical gentleman, in his impatience at this unlooked for delay, loosened a bit of mortar from his resting place, which, falling among the bushes beneath, started the reclining guardian to his feet.</p>
<p>Most fortunately for us, so deep had been the brown study in which he was immersed, and so full were his thoughts on the two subjects of more money, and the old woman’s absence, that he was quite at a loss to know whence the sound proceeded, in which dilemma he again paid a visit to the street, and on his return found the light of the cigar — which, in his first alarm he had dropped — extinguished.</p>
<p>I take it, the Caballéro must have been something of a philosopher; for, after two or three ineffectual attempts to re-kindle life in the bosom of his friend, he merely shrugged up his shoulders with an air of resignation, placed the remnant of the soothing narcotic in his girdle, laid down on the grass, and in five minutes his olfactory nerve gave pleasing intimation of the degree of vigilance with which he executed the trust confided to his keeping.</p>
<p>“Now’s the time,” whispered the Cornet. “Softly, softly, and the moment we’re ready, Austin, you cram your handkerchief half way down the brute’s throat — you, Juan, seize his legs and bind them, — and I’ll throw myself right across his body, pinning both his arms — come.” In safety and in silence we reached the court, and, creeping almost noiselessly across the turf — the sound of our steps being rendered inaudible by the play of the fountain — in a few seconds we stood by our unconscious victim.</p>
<p>“Are you ready?” Breathed the pale mortal.</p>
<p>“Ready,” was the reply.</p>
<p>“Then seize him.” And, without the chance of a struggle, the descendant of generations and generations of heroes, counts and princes, lay as immoveable as his progenitors who had strutted their short hour on the stage of life before him.</p>
<p>“Bravo,” cried the dehghted Cornet in a low tone. “Now for the others: if they’re asleep all we have to do will to be to tread quietly and fasten them into their room; if awake, we must take our chance and have at them — so here goes.” And off he went on tiptoe up the stairs, as nimbly as a rope-dancer at Astley’s, and, by signs, soon gave us to understand that the two brothers were in no condition to oppose our proceedings; gently closing their door therefore, and bolting it on the outside, we left them to sleep over the fatigues of their watching.</p>
<p>Opposition seemed now at an end; and the Señorita, who had observed our proceedings from her balcony, came hastily forward to thank her benefactor, for so she termed the pallid lover. And there was a scene of sighs, and groans, and blushes, by the side of the fountain by moonhght, which would have been worth a thousand a year to any one working up a tale of true love, for distribution in a young ladies’ seminary.</p>
<p>“Vamos,” cried Juan impatiently, unlocking the door leading to the street, “vamos, señores.”</p> 
<p>“Si, Juan, vamonos,” I chimed in, anxious to put an end to this ill-timed exhibition of the affections, “come along, come.”</p>
<p>“Come along then, old boy, look out into the street and see if all’s right, Juan;” exclaimed the Cornet.</p>
<p>“Si, señor,” replied the Andalusian. “But shall we leave the Caballéro here?” pointing to the prostrate Castilian.</p>
<p>“Oh, no, far from it,” said the Cornet. “I’ve thought of a place for him, long since. Have you remarked, Austin, with what bad taste the fountain, there, sends up one long stream of water, instead of branching out bell fashion, like the lip of a claret glass on the top of a convolvulus? ‘Pon my faith, but it’s a pity so pretty an article should be spoiled for want of taste.”</p> 
<p>“Are you mad?” I exclaimed, “to stand here talking such infernal nonsense, when, in two minutes, you may have half the town in pursuit of you?”</p>
<p>“Devil the bit;” said the Cornet, “but I must alter that thing, if I die for it. Here, Juan, help me to hoist my brother-in-law on the top of the fountain.” And in one second the water meeting with an unlooked for impediment to its accustomed egress, darted out indignantly in every possible and imaginable direction, in the midst of which, strapped securely to the pedestal, sat the Caballéro, the very picture of a river God, around whose form the limpid element squirted, showered, and fell, in a manner which would have done infinite credit to the principal director of the Chatsworth water-works.</p>
<p>“Austin,” enquired the Cornet, as we all four jogged down the narrow streets leading to our lodgings — having taken care to bring away the old Don’s key with us — “Austin, why’s my brother-in-law like the orderly officer in a cavalry regiment?”</p>
<p>“Why?” I enquired.</p> 
<p>“Because,” chuckled the Cornet, “he’s got the watering order parade to himself.” Having uttered which witticism, we dismounted at the door of our abode.</p>
<p>Our servants had not been idle during our absence, for we found every thing packed and arranged for instant departure. All pecuniary matters had been adjusted the day before — a carriage, with four good mules, waited to convey my friend and the Señorita to the frontiers — and my horse, together with my servants, sumpter mule, and guide, stood in the court prepared for our march towards the coast. Nothing now remained but to go through the marriage ceremony, which an accomodating padre was kind enough to perform, for certain considerations and penances, and then to consume the excellent supper which was to compose our last meal in Vittoria.</p>
<p>Recollecting the old lady was still an inmate of the house, I went to fetch her to the banquet; but so soundly did she sleep, or feign, — I know not which — that, being seized with a fit of compassion, I had her undressed and laid comfortably in the bed where the Cornet was accustomed to repose; but, as I afterwards heard, my good-natured intentions failed in their purpose, for the Duéña having been discovered during the day, in the spot where I had placed her, the scandalous reports which were circulated to her detriment were, as my informant stated, absolutely awful: poor old soul, I am confident they were unfounded.</p>
<p>A men’ier party than we presented could not possibily have assembled round a supper table. The lovely bride was, in truth, as the Cornet had affirmed, beautiful indeed, and certainly inferior to none whom I had ever beheld, if I except my handsome cousin Mary. How I came to think of her at that moment I know not; but the remembrance brought with it some sensations which were so much out of place on the occasion, that it took divers tumblers of champaign before I could regain my former joyousness of spirits.</p>
<p>Dearest friends must part. And as a faint streak of day glimmered in the east, we judged it prudent to decamp. It had been intended to have taken the padre some miles in the road with the newdy married couple, for fear of any untimely communication on his part; but so frequent were his professions of friendship, and so much wine did he require to enable him to express his feelings, that, when the time for departure arrived, he was incapable of motion. We were therefore compelled to leave him where he lay, which contributed not a little to the embellishment of the tale, having for its theme the old lady’s delinquencies.</p>
<p>“Vaya vm. con Dios, Señior,” murmured as sweet a voice as it ever fell to my lot to listen to; “viva vm. muchos años,” and I felt my finger encircled with a memento of her gratitude for my small share in her emancipation. A tear, I hardly know why, almost glistened in my eye, as the sylph-like form of the beautiful girl sprang into the carriage.</p>
<p>“God bless you, old fellow,” exclaimed the Cornet. “Ten thousand thanks for all you’ve done for me. I can’t express what I feel, but hang it, Harry, you understand me. Farewell! Austin, and please God, we’ll meet again.”</p> 
<p>“Vamos,” shouted Juan. The carriage rolled on — and I stood in the court-yard of our lodging, with one foot in the stirrup and none but my guide and servant by me. My friend had departed, and I was alone. He, whose kindness had saved me from death when in that dreaded hopital, and whose exuberant spirits and unconquerable good humour had been my companion for weeks, had passed away. Dismal thoughts were fast crowding on my imagination; but, with a violent effort, shaking them off, I bethought me that the safest and wisest plan would be to follow the Cornet’s example of departing. So, echoing the word of my pale-faced ally, I shouted ‘vamos;’ and throwing my right leg over the cantel of my saddle, in half an hour the town of Vittoria lay full two leagues in my rear.</p>

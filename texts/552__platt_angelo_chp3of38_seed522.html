<!-- chapter heading: <p>"IN WHICH ABEL, 'THE BLACK,' PLAYS AN UGLY PART.</p> -->

<p>For a minute or more Ann and Aunt Joyce sat buried in their own reflections ; when, seemingly bethinking herself of something, ” Strange !” said Aunt Balfour — rather muttering it to herself, as she clasped her shrivelled hands tight in her lap, than speaking it aloud — ” strange ! that none of the bodies were found, after the wreck of the <em>Jeanne Jules,</em> and she went down within half a mile of the shore.”</p>

<p>Aunt Joyce had forgotten. She was getting old, and her memory failed her. Five bodies were found next tide, and among them the dead body of a gipsy woman ; but her husband was washed away, and the child with him.</p>

<p>This Ann had explained to Aunt Joyce often before ; and now she listened again, to quite understand it. But somehow it seemed difficult to comprehend ; and even when she gravely nodded her head, as if satisfied, Ann saw that to the last she would cling to the belief, that, ” as no one had seen the child’s drowned body, who could say he was dead ?”</p>

<p>The mere thought of it blanched Ann’s cheeks. To hope such a thing was, she felt, most fruitless. All the evidence she could collect went the other way. The wreck was a certified fact; also that ” there were a gipsy-looking man and woman, with a male baby in arms, exactly answering to the description of little Leonard, on board the <em>Jeanne Jules,</em> when she went down ;” also that ” the woman’s dead body was washed ashore, but the man’s and child’s were never seen again.” Then what hope was there that her baby could have escaped, swallowed up in the waves as they were that dreadful day ? There was none. Yet did the mother, spite of herself, sit and vacantly gaze at Aunt Joyce’s ominous mutterings to herself, and shakes of the head, and ” wonder she would not be convinced, after all she had told her.”</p>

<p>” No one has seen his dead body,” muttered Aunt Joyce to herself — drawn into a doze by the fire, — ” so how say he is drowned ?”</p>

<p>” Oh, God !” ejaculated Ann, giving vent to her misery ; ” what a burthen is mine !”</p>

<p>” Hush ! hush ! child,’ rebuked Aunt Joyce, rousing herself from her reverie ; ” say not so. He gives, and He takes away. Who are we, to dispute His right ;” and then closing her eyes again — ” Hum—hum — no one saw his drowned body,” she kept murmuring — ” then how say he is dead?”</p>

<p>A groan broke from Ann’s breast.</p>

<p>“Hush ! hush ! child. Are we not His, to do as He will with us ? He gives, and He takes away. His will be done !”</p>

<p>“Amen!” sobbed Ann; and going again to her 1 comforter,’ Aunt Joyce dozed and muttered on uninterrupted.</p>

<p>And thus they sat in silence for some minutes; when suddenly waking— “Ann, child!” said Aunt Joyce, moving her chair closer to her, and clutching her tight round the wrist; “who is that Angelo Lyons, of Trinidad, eh ? old Mr. Lincoln’s partner ? Don’t you know ? Next of kin to Basil Horne, to be sure, after your husband. Took the name of Lyons, didn’t he, with the Tobago estate, left him by his kinsman Enoch? Ah, then, mind, child — it’s well for you that Oliver Boys did what he did for Leonard; else, it’s little, methinks, Basil Horne would have done for Ann Balfour.”</p>

<p>Ann looked bewildered.</p>

<p>” Don’t you see, child— now your husband is gone and your boy, too, eh ? eh ? — who conies next ? Angelo Lyons, eh ? Yes, yes ! Though, by right, he stood before Leonard. But Basil was always afraid of him, and had Leonard there to keep him company. And now—eh—eh—how will it be ?”</p>

<p>” I know not, nor care,” sighed Ann.</p>

<p>” For his money ? No, no, child ! Thank the Great Giver ! you can do without that. Ah, my child ! it is little we need here, to prepare us for hereafter. Heaven be praised ! you have ample, and over. But you see—this Angelo Lyons stands first <em>now</em> — if— if— ” and Aunt Joyce tightened her grasp of Ann’s wrist— “Basil’s heart don’t melt towards you, as it may at last, when his hour comes, and he thinks of what Leonard did for him. Whether or no, it’s Angelo Lyons stands next <em>now.</em> Aye, aye, God’s will be done ! But least of all need <em>he</em> weep for what has happened. Hist, child — it’s a dark, deep mind that of Angelo Lyons’. But Basil Horne’s is not a bad heart, left to itself—no, no !”</p>

<p>” Hark !” said Ann, as sounds of some one moving below caught her ear.</p>

<p>” It’s Hester has got up, and come down for a little, be sure,” smiled Aunt Joyce, pleased to think she was better. ” And it’s my belief, child,” she continued, without heeding Ann’s listening ear, ” Basil Horne’s heart <em>will</em> yearn towards you, say or do what they will. He never approved of Angelo Lyons’ quick rise after Gilbert Lincoln’s death. Oh, it’s a dark, deep mind that of Angelo Lyons’ ! Well Basil may fear him. It used to turn your uncle Tristram’s face as white as a sheet, when —”</p>

<p>“Hark !” repeated Ann, rising and going to the door—” I fancied—”</p>

<p>“So did I,” said Aunt Joyce, raising herself up, and hobbling into the passage — ” that some one crossed the hall — Hester ! Hester !”</p>

<p>But, if within hearing, Hester answered not; and aunt and niece looked at each other, dumbstruck.</p>

<p>“I heard a foot-fall,” said Ann, dropping her voice, as she stepped towards the stair-head leading to the kitchen, ” or my ears deceived me.”</p>

<p>” The rat, maybe,” muttered Aunt Joyce ; but, nevertheless, visibly perplexed, as there had been many robberies in Shiphampton of late, and it was well known she kept large sums of money in the house.</p>

<p>Ann listened at the stair-top.</p>

<p>All was still. When recollecting that she had forgettingly gone to the back door, instead of the front, with her plate-full of food for the poor ‘black,’ and that very likely she had left it unlocked, and so it had been blown open, perhaps, by the wind, Ann, who was no coward, returned to the parlour, lighted the taper on the mantle-shelf, and bidding her aunt sit down again, had reached midway between the stair foot and the kitchen door, when thinking she heard something move in the dark closet under the stairs, she was hesitating whether to look in it, or not, when suddenly the light was blown out, and before she could utter another cry — after the piercing scream with which she struggled to escape from her assailant,— was silenced for ever by a blow that laid her dead on the stones. Not two minutes after which, aghast with fright, yet summoning by a superhuman effort all her remaining old strength, to hobble to the rescue, came Aunt Joyce, face to face with features that to have seen once was to know them for ever; and staggering back at the sight of them—it was no part of the murderer’s design to ever be identified, if he could help it, by those piercing old eyes, agonizedly rivetted on him; so he had but to raise his arm again — and then — when what else was done that had to be done —get away as fast as he could from the scene of slaughter.</p>

<p>Molly, the cook and housekeeper, was down town, visiting her sick mother, and had leave to remain with her all night ; and Hester was ill in bed upstairs, safely sleeping, under the promise made her by Mrs. Ann Balfour that “she herself would see to the fastening up of the house, and all else appertaining thereto, before they went to rest.” And Hester’s sound sleep, from the composing draught the doctor had given her, brought her to the early morning without waking; when taking a drink of the barley-water by her side, she lay down again, nothing doubting but that ” Molly would bring her her breakfast as usual, and good, kind Mrs. Ann Balfour come and see her, and read to her from the Bible.”</p>

<p>But it happening that Molly’s mother was worse, so that Molly could not leave her, to be back as soon as she wished, the clocks struck half-past six ; and as no one was moving below, Hester sat up to listen. Till seven striking, she began to “wonder where Molly was,” and to ” wonder, too, that so early a riser as Mrs. Ann should have overslept herself so long.” But when eight came, and seemingly there was no one to answer the repeated rings at the back door bell, Hester got uneasy, and huddling on her clothes, went out on the landing to hearken. Another ring ! Determined by which, and anxious to ascertain if Molly had come in, she descended to the basement, and must have passed, on her way to the kitchen, within a step or two of the murdered bodies, that she made so sure were safe and snug in their warm beds, while she was striking a light.</p>

<p>The lighted candle showed her that Molly had not returned, that the back door was locked and bolted, and everything in its place, ” as was always looked to by Miss Balfour or Mrs. Ann before going to bed. So of course Molly’s mother can’t be no better,” said Hester to herself, “or Molly would have been back. But how strange that Mrs. Ann isn’t up, and she’s never a-bed after six. Suppose I go and see. Oh, dear ! how dull it do seem—no one about by now.” Whereupon extinguishing the candle, which made the passage to the stairs so dark that, with her thoughts on Molly and her mother, she overstepped the stair-foot a little — Hester was brought to recollection by ” stumbling over something in her path;” and when Molly, with the police, obtained an entrance presently afterwards — but that poor Hester did just breathe when lifted up from her frightful bed, there would have been none left in the old house for Molly to mingle her tears with, and seek companionship and consolation from, in her bitter woe.</p>

<p>Oh, what a day for Shiphampton ! Who shall depict it ? The direst poverty, struck down by the assassin, collects its gaping crowds, and loudly claims its rights at the hands of justice; but when ran the breathless tidings from street to street, till not a house within twenty miles but was ringing with it, that “the richest woman in all Hampshire had been foully murdered, as also her rich niece, and that they were found, next morning, close to their own kitchen, weltering in their blood,” then was to be seen what wealth and rank and position stood for in men’s minds, when suddenly laid low, over and above the humble, insignificant life which, when lost, hurt nobody, benefited none.</p>

<p>Such a panic had never been known in Shiphampton before. Its richest House was gone. Sturdy men talked of with white lips, while their pale frightened women and children gathered together, aghast, in corners, and eagerly looked at each other with straining eyes, and bated breath, for any and every additional horrible particular they could draw from each other, with shudders, with which to spice the horrid feast. While on went rumour with its endless tongues, first pointing to this person, as the culprit, then to that, then to the other, as the whim seized them, till the old town was beside itself. When came a cry — ” They’ve got him !” And the crowd round the Town Hall, to catch a sight of ‘ the black’s‘ guilty face, as they took him before the magistrates, must have struck terror indeed into Abel’s soul — with that blood on his clothes, scarcely dry, which he said ” came dere from me cutting me hand while eating de bread and de meat giben me by de young lady.”</p>

<p>“Guilty! guilty !” yelled the mob; and the old town breathed again at the glorious thought of “the law’s omnipotence.”</p>

<p>Clearly, appearances were against the man Abel, ‘the black ;’ nothing could look uglier. He had been seen begging at Greystone House; and shortly afterwards a passer by ” observed him go to the front door, and there stand, looking up at the windows, till a lady, in mourning, brought him some food which he went opposite to eat under the portico of the house facing it. And he was still in the same place when he, the witness, returned from his errand to Water Street ; for he particularly noticed the way ‘ the black’ seemed to bend himself all of a heap, to avoid notice; and then sat up again, as soon as he thought he was unobserved ; and then got up— for he, the witness, stood behind the corner of Harbour Lane and watched him—got up and crossed the road towards the back-way that led to the rear of the house, when he lost sight of him. Furthermore, he, the witness, was induced to keep his eye on him, from the man’s peculiarly forbidding countenance, which forcibly struck him at the time as the most ferocious looking negro-face he had ever seen in his life ; and he told his wife so when he got home, and it had haunted him ever since.”</p>

<p>“Which bringing all eyes in court on the accused, certainly his gloomy, downcast mien, coupled with a contour of features exceedingly unprepossessing, pleaded little in his favour ; and the presumptive supposition of his guilt being very strong, notwithstanding his indignant denials, Abel was remanded in due form, for further evidence against him before committal on the charge of murder.</p>

<p>Then, when he was brought up again, Abel was calmer and more collected, and had his own tale to tell the court.</p>

<p>“It is true,” he granted, “that me was hungry ; and dat de young lady in de black, beside de old lady wid de spectacles on at de great big house wid de fire blazing, looked at me ober de blind, and called me to de door, and told me to wait dere till she come back ; and then did come and gib me de bread and meat and de pudding, which me did take and eat on de steps under de house opposite. And when me was cutting de meat into bits to put in me pocket, me cut me hand, and dat was how de blood did come on me clothes, dat’s true. But no, me neber did go to de back at all, me didn’t, dat not true. But when me got up and did cross de way, me saw a man, me did,” —and he shewed his ivory-white teeth at the recollection, and grinned at the Bench, — ” a man who run into de road from de front, and come round by me, bolt ! and when me did look at him, he turned quick away he did, down de street to de riber, and — and — dat dere is all me know, and me cannot say no more, dat’s true.”</p>

<p>” And where is the knife he says he cut his hand with, while cutting the meat ?” asked the chairman, addressing the policeman who took Abel in charge.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t anywhere on his person, when we searched him, your worship.”</p>

<p>” Do you mean to say he hadn’t a knife ?”</p>

<p>” Not that we found anywhere, your worship;” and down went Abel’s eyes on the ground, as if crushed it.</p>

<p>A murmur ran through the court.</p>

<p>“Silence!”</p>

<p>” Has search been made for the knife ?”</p>

<p>” Yes, your worship.”</p>

<p>“And no knife, answering the description, has been found, you say ?”</p>

<p>” None,” your worship.</p>

<p>” Me had de knife on de step,” said Abel, looking up at the policeman by his side, ” and me cut me hand wid it, cutting me meat, dat’s true.”</p>

<p>” If so, he may have dropped somewhere,” suggested the chairman, ” and may yet be found.”</p>

<p>Whereupon there was remand the second till that day week, for further evidence; and the prisoner went back to his prison.</p>

<p>And on his next appearance before their worships, Abel had to face an ugly fact made known to the court that day, viz., that “no knife had been found answering the description given by the accused of the one with which he said he cut his hand the deep gash on while, shivering with cold, he was eating the food he got from the young lady at Greystone House. Every possible search had been made for it, in vain; nor had any instrument been discovered, as yet, with which the murder could have been committed.”</p>

<p>What said the prisoner at the bar?</p>

<p>Nothing for a minute or two, while all eyes in court were greedily devouring his downcast looks and sullen silence ; when seemingly roused by the thoughts working in him which he was trying to shape into fitting words for their worships —</p>

<p>” Me cut de victuals wid me knife on de step,” he said, composedly glancing up at the officer by his side, ” dat’s true — me knife dat me Massa gib me dat day at Trinidad — me Massa, Mr. Merric Lincoln ob Tobago —dat day he come and say ‘Abel, cut de cord ob de box dere ;’ and me hadn’t me knife, and he say ‘ keep dat, Abel, dat’s yours, dat knife, and welcome ;’ and dat’s true me cut me meat wid it, and cut me hand, is.”</p>

<p>And it was spoken so apparently unpremeditatedly, and with such almost childish concern for the loss of his property, that the magistrates looked at each other, as at fault what to think. But as the police stuck to that ” from sundry communications they had received, they had no doubt they should be able to make out a case to go to a jury, if time were given them,” back went Abel again to his lonely cell, to chew the bitter cud of his many woes, while the law was at work in his behalf—not the least of which seemed to be the irreparable loss of his knife. It appeared to distress him more than all the rest put together, more than even the groans and hissing and hootings of the mob collected to catch a sight of his black face at the court house and the lock-up. He grinned at them, and shewed his white teeth and the whites of his eyes, as if in derision ; but his brow grew darker and darker when ‘no knife could be found,’ and he could give no satisfactory description of the man he said ” came out ob de front door ob de great big house,” when he was crossing the road, ” and did run against me so quick at de corner, dat we both slip down on de ice — and when me got up, de man was gone, dat’s true.”</p>

<p>But this ‘ collision at the corner, on the slippery road,’ being a new feature in the case, not mentioned by the prisoner before, it rather told against than for him. And it further transpiring what a vagabond-life he had been leading from town to town, with his bundle of ballads, for months past, while professing to be unable to return to his wife and children in Tobago, from want of means to get back to them, as also the several petty crimes that had been committed where he had shown his face, and which were now swelling the charge — what were the magistrates to do ?</p>

<p>Clearly, by all rules of justice —as, after more than a month spent in fruitless remands, there was no case to send to a jury —to forthwith release the accused ; and be very sorry, if he were innocent, that he had suffered so much at their hands ; but still more so, if he were guilty, that the ” omnipotence of the law,” as they called it, was often so impotent to vindicate itself as it should do.</p>

<p>Abel White was at large. And so convinced were some ultra-philanthropical old ladies and gentlemen of his innocence, in the teeth of the almost universal belief in his guilt, that a sum of money was collected in the town, wherewith to ship him off to Tobago. Where he arrived ” hale and hearty,” they said, ” though never ceasing throughout the voyage to deplore, above all things, the loss of his knife; over the thought of which he would shed tears, when talking of it; for he declared he ‘lubbed as he lubbed his life.’ “</p>

<p>But Abel never seemed willing to be questioned about the man he said came out of the front door of Greystone House, and ran against him at the corner of River Street. Or if he deigned to give any further particulars on the subject, there was always a strange reserve in his answers and manner, which sometimes left the impression on the captain’s mind that he knew more than he chose to acknowledge; and that, though his, Abel’s, was not the hand perhaps which struck the blows, he was not as ignorant as he pretended to be of whose murderous arm it was by which the unfortunate ladies came by their dreadful death. It was strange, too, that he should have been so near the house all the time, and seen no one go in, nor heard any noise. And if access had been obtained to the kitchen by the back way, how was it the yard door was barred and bolted, and the scullery door locked inside ? True, the murderer might have got in and concealed himself somewhere, before Mrs. Ann Balfour fastened up, after Mary Balls left to go to her mother ; in which case, he might have quitted the house, after the murder, by the front door, as Abel had said. Or Mrs. Ann Balfour might have forgotten to fasten the scullery door, which opened into the yard, and so the murderer had got in that way, and, as a blind, locked and bolted it, before his escape. Still, how was it possible that two persons could be brutally slain, as the old lady and her niece were, on the same spot almost, by one man? Or if they were, was likely any one, not deaf, could have been sitting where Abel was, under the portico of the house opposite, and known nothing about it? It was very mysterious. And, truth to speak, Abel’s evasive manner, when narrowly interrogated thereon, was, to say the least, anything but favourable to himself. But for this he appeared to care nothing,
his thoughts being seemingly engrossed with the loss of his knife, and the little likelihood there was of his ever seeing it again. He was continually dwelling on it, and on ” how it must have dropped from me pocket, when de man ran against me, and me slipped down, and de man, too.”</p>

<p>This he firmly adhered to; there was no hesitation with him about it; he would ” be sworn before God, as he hoped for mercy in Heaven,” that he saw a man leave the house by the front way, who, turning quick round the corner of River Street, came bolt against him, and down they both went in the road, when the knife must have fallen from his pocket. Since when all had gone wrong with him. And it was ” what he was told would happen, as no good ever came of such gifts. Yes, yes!” he would add, while the tears rolled down his cheeks; “no good come to me den, dat’s true. Me got taken up, me did, and shut in de dark, and hissed and hooted at, like de wild beasts, for — oh, God! — killing de old lady and de young lady dat gib me food, and say ‘what’s your name, poor man?’ and smile at me so sweet when she empty de victuals into me hat? —which was de great lie, it was, dat’s true! Me kill de young lady dat was kind to Abel, and say ‘ poor man,’ and ‘ good night, Abel?’ —me do dat ?” and contenting himself with indignantly shaking his woolly head, while his throat was too full to say more—if Abel, ‘ the black,’ was acting the hypocrite, to deceive the captain and crew, oh, what a black hypocrite he was !</p>

<p>And it must be admitted that this was the light in which Abel was regarded by ninety-nine out of a hundred in Shiphampton. Except by the extreme philanthropic few, he was universally believed to be a monster of iniquity and pretence. Few had any doubt of his guilt ; and even those most inclined to adjudge him innocent, till he was proved to be otherwise, listened with perturbed brows to the fact of ‘ no knife having been found,’ though every search had been made for it ; till they could not but grant that ‘ it looked very bad.’ As also his alleged ‘ collision with the man in the road; ‘ no such person as he represented him to be having been seen by any one in Shiphampton, either before the murder or after it, in or about the town, or leaving it by railway or any other conveyance whatever.</p>

<p>But Abel heard nothing of the smothered storm he left behind him, and landed on his native shores seemingly with but one anxiety at heart, and that was for ‘ the loss of his knife.’ Nor could all the arguments of his wife and children, when, with tears, he told them of it, and the shocking trouble it had caused him, do more than make him think of it the oftener, and keep repeating ” no, no — no more luck for Abel, now me lost me knife.”</p>

The file `Random Canon Substitutions.docx` describes substitutions which were
made around the end of May 2019. In May 2019 we discovered that several novels
which we thought did not have first-edition digital surrogates did, in fact,
have them. The discovered first-edition digital surrogates were (virtually?)
all at the British Library.

Making the substitutions described in `Random Canon Substitutions.docx`
corrects things. Books which have first-edition digital surrogates and should
have been sampled by our random sampling procedure now are sampled in the
correct order.

NOTE(2019-08-29): The name of this dataset was changed from "Random Canon" to
"Common Library" in August 2019.

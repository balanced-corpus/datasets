Checking Text Entry Accuracy
============================

Date: 2020-08-10  

Reviewers asked us to report how accurately the texts had been keyed-in.

In order to accomplish this we first selected four titles at random and then, from each title, selected a page at random (from within the chosen section or chapter). We double-keyed all full paragraphs on the chosen page, resolving all disagreements. We then compared these "gold standard" texts to the texts in the common library to measure text entry accuracy.

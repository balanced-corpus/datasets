In December 2018, we (Troy Bassett and Allen Riddell) realized we needed to
restrict the sample frame to a clearly identifiable subpopulation: novels which
had page images available for *the first edition*. This involved replacing a
number of texts. We also replaced titles which were found, during 2018, to have
faulty metadata in the ATCL database. Here's the list:

- Payne's year was incorrect
- Reid's year was incorrect
- Novel by "Ursula" had incorrect gender annotation
- Novel by Macdonald does not have first edition page images
- Novel by Kenealy does not have first edition page images
- Novel by Mulholland does not have first edition page images
- Novel by Ouida does not have first edition page images
- Novel by Oppenheim does not have first edition page images
- Novel by Johnston does not have first edition page images
- Novel by Hutcheson does not have first edition page images
- Novel by Everett-Green was already present in the Random Canon, sample a new one.

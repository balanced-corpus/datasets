During June 2019 and July 2019, we (Troy J. Bassett and Allen Riddell),
discovered some titles which had faulty gender attributions in ATCL. For
example, sample index 88 is a novel from 1887 by an unknown gender author.
Originally a novel by "Sydney Carstone" (labeled as unknown gender in the ATCL)
was sampled. This gender attribution is a mistake because the name "Sydney" was
essentially only used by men during the 19th century. (This fact was verified
using census data.) So another novel was sampled to replace this novel. This
sort of replacement occurred a couple of times.
